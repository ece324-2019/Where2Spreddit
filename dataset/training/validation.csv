I really like traffic,"I get anxiety about death, and car accidents do a really good job of killing people. When traffic is slow, bumper to bumper, I'm pretty relaxed. I don't have to worry about getting into an accident because if I do, it'll be at a snails pace. Sure it sucks when you have to be somewhere, but if it was bumper to bumper traffic everywhere I'd love it. Plus you can listen to a really good audio book, podcast, or anything else like that.

UPDATE I've been putting off introducing my [28M] girlfriend [26F] to my parents [60sM/F] because they'll be weird about her weight,"[OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dh673p/my_28m_parents_60s_mf_are_about_to_meet_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. Including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

Went like this. Paraphrasing of course. 


Me: Hey Mom and Dad, You know I mentioned a girlfriend a few times. We're moving in together so I'm thinking I'll bring her out. 


Mom: Oh that's nice. First week of December maybe? 


Me: Sure. Look there's one thing though. She's not thin. If you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we're done, we're going home. I love her. And she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so I expect you to show her the same respect. 


Mom: But you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—


Me: No. This is exactly what I'm talking about. 


Mom: Fine. I'm just happy I finally get to meet her. 


Dad: *Insulting weight related comment*


Me: What the fuck dad? 


Mom: Oh babe give it a rest, it can't be that bad. 


Me: No if there's any chance of that sort of commentary, I'll just not come. I have zero tolerance for this. You're going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won't get the chance to screw it up. 


Dad: *Insulting joke* 



Me: Ok, bye. If you wonder why [brother] is buying a tux for a wedding you've heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



Mom: No, wait, I'll make sure his act is together by the time you're out here. 


Dad: *Insulting comment* 



Me: I'm hanging up. 


So it looks like I'm going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. Probably not soon. My girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and I started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said ""It would be nice if I could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won't be possible and it definitely isn't worth putting you through this.""

So thanks for the comments and help. For now it's a non issue it turns out. 


*tl;dr: My dad couldn't even hold it together through a phone call so my mom will meet my girlfriend some other time, my dad is affectively disinvited in the event we get married, and we're just going to let this go for now.*",relationship_advice
TIFU by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended,"Obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. My brother and I have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). This agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so I was convinced he still remembered.

A couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". Eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. I got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. I decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

Near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. There's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. So I went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""[brother's name], if you're watching this, I'm already dead. Everyone on the world pretty much is. It's been about eight months since you went to [hospital name]. You need to head for the safe haven in Helsinki (we live in western Canada) - mom might be there. God speed."" I managed to sync it up to the TV and woke him up as it was starting.

This is where it all goes to complete shit. My brother began to lose it immediately. He started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. I grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. Nurses came in and I was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

He got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. My mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. My dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. I'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. I've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

Worth the wait though.

tl;dr: Convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

EDIT: Wow this blew up?! I don't have a ton of time but:

1) I don't want to upload the video. I made it sound tamer than it was, I look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xD

2) The TVs in the hospital had HDMI ports. I just plugged it into my Chromebook. 

3) I can see why people say I made this up for karma, but I didn't create a throwaway to do that.  If I cared that much, I would've posted it on my main account.

4) My mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. She hasn't been happy with me moving (western Canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. She paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",tifu
META: This sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world,"I've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and I feel like I've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. Over time, more and more of the posts seem to have A- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and B- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

Given that, I think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

So just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

They'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. They'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. They'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. They'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

The internet has its own values, and that's fine. But in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? People who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? People who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? The people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

So yeah. I love this sub, I love reading the stories and I find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. But I personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people I know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. I don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

So even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. And maybe this is just me, but I really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

Or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. That's a discussion worth having too.

Edit: Thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. And lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

Edit 2: Wow, this got very big. It's gonna take me a minute to read all this. 

And alright guys, maybe the one about not ever wanting to socialize with coworkers outside of work is more of a thing in my field, not a universal experience. Academia blurs the line between personal and professional like nobody's business, so I might have a warped view on this one. 

Edit 3: I've never seen this movie, but it's come to my attention that there already exists in this world an excellent TL,DR: ""You're not wrong Walter, you're just an asshole""",AmItheAsshole
(Update to) I [32M] was going to propose to my girlfriend [30F] until she told me she's pregnant,"I was thinking I'd edit the original post, but I decided I'd rather spend the night focused on my fiance than on reddit. Since the original post really blew up I don't think too many people would see an edit, so I'm making a new post instead.

I took my lunch break early to be with my girlfriend at the OBGYN visit. The IUD was removed without any problems (it had shifted around which likely caused it to fail), and the pregnancy is not ectopic. However, a miscarriage is more likely, and if the baby is carried to term, there's a higher chance for complications and defects. It's far from a guarantee but it's a lot more risky than if it was any other birth control method that failed. I ended up taking the rest of the afternoon off so we could talk through everything together. Eventually we decided we should get out of the house so we put some leftovers in my lunch bag and went to the park.

Normally there is nothing special about eating day-old hoagies in a park, but it really helped us relax. We sat on a blanket at the spot we first met and talked about a lot of things. Eventually the sun began to set and I decided it was time. I started to say I had been planning to do this for awhile and it wasn't because she was pregnant but she started tearing up and cut me off. She told me she understood so I skipped the rest of my fluff and asked her to marry me. She said yes, and we spent the next few minutes crying, hugging, and kissing. After we got our emotions under control she told me she'd seen my post (I knew she used reddit but I didn't realize she lurked here) and had been expecting it all evening. She said she would have preferred I proposed at our anniversary dinner (can't argue with that) but this was still about as lovely as she could have hoped for.

Although the shadow of a potentially stormy pregnancy is looming above us, I am still very happy and feel lucky to be with her. We're going to visit our parents this weekend to break the news and get through the mountain of questions they're sure to have. We're not thinking about a wedding ceremony yet, but we'll definitely be getting our marriage ~~license~~  certificate (thanks for pointing out the difference) in the next few months like someone suggested.

These past few days have been a roller coaster of emotion. Thanks for helping me get over my worries.

Mashed potatoes with unpeeled skins are far superior to mashed potatoes without the skin,"Title says it, I do t know how unpopular this is, but in my opinion, mashed potatoes should by default be made with non-peeled potatoes, and I have three reasons why.

1.) They taste better:
The skin adds a chewy aspect to it rather then it being just a slurry you swallow, you actually chew the food...crazy

2.). It wayyy easier:  
No need for a fuck ass peeler, don't have to clean it, plus they're kinda scary.  All you need to do for the potatoes is scrub them under some warm water, what a bother.

3.). It's healthier:
Maybe someone can correct me, but I'm pretty sure skin on mashed potatoes are healthier cause of fiber and stuff

TIFU by having a stress-induced orgasm in a public library.,"Throwaway account because my dignity.

Obligatory this happened during midterms in October. I just haven't had a chance to write about it until now.

This is going to be a long one, but I feel this story requires a certain degree of explanation before reaching the climax (no pun intended).

I'm a 26-year-old woman in a rather intensive graduate program. To put it in perspective, grad programs in this field typically take two years to complete, but the one I'm enrolled in is a one-year program. So right of the bat, I'm completing two years' worth of coursework in one. Secondly, I'm now at a fairly prestigious university after having completed my undergrad at a not-so-great university. I always thought I had high standards for myself, but the expectations at this school are *much* higher than what I'm used to, and I still question all the time whether I'm actually good enough to be here. Thirdly, I'm not so great at handling stress. I am working with a therapist through campus psychological services, but I'm not finding their approach to therapy particularly helpful. And since that's all I can afford right now with my insurance, that's the best I can get.

Bottom line: I'm stressed out all the time. And midterms were *hell*: four hefty papers all due within three days of each other. Now, three of those papers weren't so bad. They took a while to write, but at least I knew what I was writing. Paper number four, however… Guys, this paper fucked me *hard*. This paper fucked me like I've never been fucked in my whole life. And I'm in an English-related field, so believe me, I am *not* used to getting fucked by papers. I won't bore you with the details, but in a nutshell, the paper required that we read a pool of approximately 30-40 journal articles and write a paper on their characteristics. (To be fair, we had from mid-August to mid-October to complete this assignment, so given the timespan, it *was* doable.) Now, if I were to write a list of all the reasons why this paper threw me off, I'd end up with a dissertation. In the limited space I have, I can't fully explain why this paper was so hard, so please just believe me when I tell you it was *hard*. Yes, even though I'd spoken to the professor about it a few times. And it was worth about a third of my grade.

Anyway, this big bastard was due on a Monday, so I brought myself to the library on Friday, determined (after several failed attempts) to *at least* get an outline done. I tried for about 2.5 hours to draw up a plan to organize this thing, but for the life of me, I *could not* figure out how to cram all the required elements into a cohesive, logical argument, especially given the miniscule word count of the assignment (2,500 words maximum, when this paper *could* have been a fucking book). Now, at this point, it's not that I was losing willpower or energy. No: the problem was that I was freaking out. I wanted to focus on this paper, but all my brain could do was assault me with a barrage of negative thoughts: *You're going to fail this paper and fail this class and lose your financial aid and drop out of school and be a huge failure to everyone because you suck…* You get the idea. And then, to make matters worse, my mental distress started to express itself physically; I *wanted* to keep writing, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely even hold my pen. My neck was stiff as a board, my head burned above my eyes, my back was spasming a little, and my heart was pounding like a fucking jackhammer. And then.

And *then*.

I've Googled this and haven't really been able to find a satisfactory explanation for what happened next. But I'll recount the sensation as I experienced it. All of a sudden, I felt a *massive* rush of blood to my lower body. I can only guess this was some kind of adrenaline-related/fight-or-flight response. My entire bottom half suddenly felt as if it had been electrified: feet, legs… and lady bits. There I was, silently losing my mind in a library full of students studying for midterms, when out of the clear blue sky, my clit feels ready to burst.

I came before I even knew what was happening. It wasn't some screaming, thrashing affair, but I did convulse in my chair and ended up moaning a little out of sheer surprise. And yes, people *definitely* noticed; I was on the quiet-study floor, so the room had been *silent* up until that point. I don't think I was obvious enough that anyone would conclude I'd just had an orgasm in the library, but still… clearly *something* had happened. I packed my shit, went the hell home, and drank several screwdrivers at 2:00 in the afternoon.

As I said, I haven't really found a thorough explanation for this (though I haven't been searching too intensely). I have found the occasional anecdotal account of people having similar experiences. Mostly, though, I've been finding articles about how stress and anxiety *inhibit* orgasm in women. For my part in this research, I state for the record that stress can, indeed, spiral so low that is sort of bursts through the other side and expresses itself as sexual ecstasy, whether you like it or not.

Also, I got a 78 on the paper. But my professor assures me it won't end up tanking my grade.

TL;DR: I got so stressed that I came involuntarily in my university library. Also, I may have masochistic tendencies and don't know who I am anymore.

EDIT: Thank you all for your thoughtful responses, as well as for the silver and gold.

I'd just like to clarify on a couple of points that have been brought up: I did not procrastinate on this assignment. I completed the reading in a timely manner and gave myself plenty of time (more than a week) to write this paper. Given the rigor of this program, that is *all* the time I could give myself to do it. The paper just never quite happened in an orderly, timely fashion because I was so confused and stressed out. Normally I never put off things until the last minute. It just sort of happened this time because I had no idea what I was doing.

Secondly, I am working with a therapist on my stress management techniques. I recently told my therapist that I'd like to do some more intensive work for managing stress, and she referred me to an off-campus therapist who will accept my insurance. Hopefully, we'll be able to work together to figure out some solutions that work for me. Again, I'm very grateful for all the advice and input! I'm really glad I could make you guys laugh. You all have made me laugh, as well!",tifu

How do you repair relations with crows?,"Story is relevant.

My neighbourhood has a lot of crows. Over twenty of them. They are generally on good terms with one another.

I watched them band together and kill one of the crows. They left its dead body in my yard. I waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because I don't want crow guts everywhere.

However, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. This brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. None of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

Now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time I am outside. Some swoop. They are becoming more and more aggressive.

Confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do I repair relations with these crows? I don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

Google is not helpful on this front at all. There is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.

AITA for completely ignoring my father's girlfriend,"It's more like ""are we the assholes?""

I have a twin (we're 16,M). We have identical faces, but you can't mix us up. I have long blonde hair, he has short black hair and piercings. He's bigger, like he works out. No one mixes us up. 

We have known her for 2 years. She mixes our names up all the time. At least 3 times a day. We know she's doing it on purpose to annoy us. 

So. Yesterday I was in living room and she called me my twin's name. I just ignored her and pretended she wasn't there. Then she called me my name and I answered her normally. My brother did the same, we did it few times. Now she's mad at us, apparently we're being extremely disrespectful and not being sympathetic because she makes ""honest mistake"" sometimes.",AmItheAsshole
UPDATE: My (21m) best friend (20f) found out that I have self harm scars and has told our entire friendship group (19-21). They are now excluding me from almost everything.,"[you can find my original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csy8ds/my_21m_best_friend_20f_found_out_that_i_have_self/)

I know since the internet doesn't like to be left hanging, so I thought I'd give you guys the update on my situation. It's sadly not the happy ending that I was hoping for.

After I read all the advice on my original post, and responded to PMs and answered questions, I decided I'd message each friend individually to ask if the general consensus of the group was really what Allie said it was (with everyone being uncomfortable, and preferring that I didn't come to the beach).

Through doing this, I sadly found out that Allie was telling the truth. Every single person in my friend group except for 2 said that my scars would make them uncomfortable at the beach (keeping in mind, I never said I'd go to the beach), and they'd rather I didn't come.

I told them all how much it hurt that they'd say this to me, and how upset I was that I was basically being abandoned by my friends, and that I didn't want to associate with them anymore because of how hurt I felt, and those messages were met with either no reply, or simply ""I'm sorry, I don't know what you want me to do about that.""

As for the 2 friends who weren't uncomfortable, they both confided in me that they have also struggled with self-harm in the past and were disgusted by the behaviour of the others in the group. One of people has chosen to stay with the group, and the other has told me that she'd like to remain friends, but still hang out with those people on occasion

So in conclusion, I lost 9 friends, I feel like shit, and I don't know if my self esteem will ever make a recovery from this.

Have a wonderful day, wherever you are.

AITA for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?,"I have 3 kids, 15F, 12F and 7M. My oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because I am too. Recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. It was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

After the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. There was a fair bit of wine involved (I was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my FIL let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate I still cuddled with my 15yo. I don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but I was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. To my surprise, my wife and MIL both agreed with him.

I have a lot of respect for my in-laws, I get along with them great and I consider them closer than my own parents. Obviously I'm quite fond of my wife as well, but I outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. I've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. They all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. AITA?

I've been single now for three years and haven't knocked boots with anyone in at least 2 so, finally fed up with celibacy and buffered by my friends success story, I joined a dating site.  


I started talking to this pretty good looking guy. He was a little boring, we didn't have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on Thursday evening. He looked exactly as he did on his profile (6""8' power lifter who looked like a legit Viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that I hadn't been catfiished but I was pretty sure I didn't want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. That said, he didn't seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so I invited him back to mine. 


It started well and I was like fuck YES, let's do this! So I said as much. I also said you're not going to call me back if we do this are you? He said he would. He's a liar. So bullet dodged. 


Anyway, he proceeds to pick me up like I weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (I'm pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. I'm like STRIP because I've gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. At this juncture, I realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but I figure babies come out of there so I'm grand.



There's a warm up wristy and a little Spiderman and then we get down to bi'ness. It's over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so I open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he's just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. 


So I'm trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have I got a tissue? My first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse. 


Blood.jpeg


So much fucking blood. Well, I know it's not a wild period since I'm not afflicted with that shit. I RUN to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. I'm like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. Meanwhile I've never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. 


We have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. I clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. Like it'll stop. 


Nope. Next day is agony and still going. Trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know I went on a date and I don't want them thinking I'm some harlot. I'm still optimistic at this point that it'll stop.


Wake up Saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. But like fresh, bullet wound type blood. And I felt so sick and dizzy. I'm freaking the fuck out. Obviously can't tell my Mum because catholic shame so I go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who I think thought I had been raped because I was crying so much because I've broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever I think for too long about how this is probably the last time I'll ever have sex and it wasn't even that good. Mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she's wonderful.


Get in to see the doctor. After a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged Asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it's determined that I have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it's on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. Brilliant.

Theres surgical glue on my vagina. I'm never dating again.

tl;dr: Had sex with a giant Viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together.

EDIT: First, wow. I didn't expect this to blow up like this. Thanks for reading and thanks for the gold to those who gave it.

Second. To clarify, a Spider-man as I meant it is also known as the finger trick (middle and ring fingers in, the rest out, pull up repeatedly) although the PLAH!! Spider-man version is also great! Hope that helps.

"Pharmacy gave my controlled substance prescription to someone else. Refuses to admit they were in the wrong, refuses to refill my prescription, refuses to tell my doctor they screwed up, and is telling me they cannot help me until they do a month long investigation.","I take a medication which is considered a controlled substance, if i don't have my medication i struggle to function properly. I go to a common pharmacy chain in Ontario, Canada. 

Last Monday i went to collect my refill of my medication, they weren't able to fully fill the full balance so instead provided me with a weeks worth of my medication, and told me to collect the balance on the following day.

On Wednesday evening i went in to collect my balance, only for the pharmacy technician to tell me she could not find my prescription. After taking my information she told me that i had already collected my remaining balance Tuesday afternoon. I denied me ever doing this, and was told she could not help me and i would need to come in Thursday morning to talk to head pharmacist to explain the situation.

Thursday morning i went and talked to the head pharmacist who:

* Insisted that i already collected my remaining balance. Which i denied repeatedly.
* I told her to confirm via their security cameras that it was not me collecting the medication, which she did. 
* Now repeatedly insisted that i allowed someone else to collect my remaining balance. I told her i have no one allowed to do that on my file, except my parents. Who neither of them is alive anymore. 
* Unfortunately she told me she could not help me further, and i need to report my medication as stolen. Which i refused to do, because i never received my balance, and i felt that would be me admitting fault on my part.
* I called my Doctor and explained my situation, and he immediately called the pharmacy. The head pharmacy tech told him that they dispensed my prescription to me. He told me unfortunately he cannot re-issue me my prescription, unless the pharmacy admits wrong doing. 
* The head pharmacist basically told me she could do nothing for me, and asked me to leave or security would be called.

I went home and called the corporate number of the pharmacy, and explained everything to them. They agreed to open an investigation however told me this could take well over a month to get a result, they gave me a case number, and recommended that i make alternative arrangements with my doctor. 

On Friday i called my doctor again, and explained everything one more time, he was sympathetic however he told me he cannot re-issue my prescription unless the pharmacy admits they screwed up because it is a controlled substance.

My (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22M) tried to spike my drink.,"This is a throwaway, my boyfriend also has a reddit account. I am sorry for how long it is but please read this, I need advice. 

Updates at the bottom of the post.

I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years now and started hanging out with his friends, all guys, a few months after we started going out. There is usually at least 4 of us at one of our places, drinks, snacks and music every friday evening. My boyfriend is out of town for the weekend and the guys invited me anyway. We were at the friend in question's place, let's call him S. S has always been very nice to me, a bit flirty in the beginning but I just brushed it off and it didn't last long anyway. He plays guitar and I play instruments as well so we always show each other our compositions.

So yesterday when I went to his place, there was another friend and everything seemed fine, we were drinking and hanging out until around 1 am when other friend says he's heading home as he works on saturdays. Not wanting to make anything awkward and as everyone was a bit buzzed, I say I should leave too to talk to my boyfriend and let him know I'm home okay. S says I should stay a bit more as he wants to show me the last piece he wrote, I agree and sit back on the couch. S brings his guitar then asks if I want something else to drink, I tell him I am okay and he insists he has an amazing whisky that I need to try, he then goes to the kitchen to bring it. In the mean time, I start heading for the toilet and catch a glimpse of him dropping something in my drink, it dissolves and he smells the glass, I quickly close the toilet door before he could notice me. Now I was tipsy but still very aware of my surroundings, and I am 100 percent sure of what I saw. He brought the two glasses and kept watching me, not knowing what to do I ""accidently"" dropped it, apologized profusely and said I should really head home and l started heading for the door. S grabs my arm and is very insistant I should stay, he keeps telling me I should spend the night, how my boyfriend doesn't need to know, that I am really hot and how horny he is. I push him and run to the door then call an uber and head home.

I don't know what to do from here, I couldn't sleep all night and I keep imagining worse case scenarios. I don't know if I should tell my boyfriend or if he would even believe me and how he would react, I haven't heard from S yet and I don't know if I can even look him in the eyes. All I know is I am not going to be able to act normally and I am sure my boyfriend will know something is wrong. I really need some advice.

Edit: Update actually, Thank you for the comments, the advie was very appreciated. I called my boyfriend and told him everything. He believes me and he was very supportive over the phone but hr is very upset, he says I should have told him right away and that he's coming back to ""beat the shit out of him"" and insists we go to the police. This is basically what I was afraid of, I am pretty sure he's going to go to S's place directly, he is 2 hours away. And I can't stop him because it's not like I can go there myself, but at least he says he is here for me.

Second Edit, another update: Thank you all for the wonderful advice and support. We're going to the police station, I am writing this on our way, I am terrified and it's late, this has been a tough day but my boyfriend has been amazingly supportive although he is very angry. We agreed that we wouldn't contact him directly and bf said he would call his other friends to let them know after we talk to the police. This is going out of proportions and I am honestly shaking while writing this but I hope this is the right choice. I am still scared to ruin someone's life over this and I don't know if anything will be done but you guys were right to open my eyes that he might have done it to someone else or will in the future. My bf is very adament on taking it in his own hands if the police don''t do something so I hope they can and I will make another post when an update is necessary. Thank you again, I would not have done this without the support here.",relationship_advice

AITA for not caring when my friend came out of the closet?,"My friend is obviously gay. He does nails with the girls, he follows make-up tutorials on YouTube, speaks in a higher tone of voice, and flails around a lot. He also gushes with the girls in our group when they bring up K-Pop celebs (guys) and joins them for shopping when we split up at the mall.

We (the guys) know he's gay, the girls most certainly do, and it's pretty much an open secret at this point. Nobody ever brings it up, and we basically just treat him like another girl.

So we're at school, it's lunchtime and we're all chilling in the cafeteria. He suddenly comes out of the closet and announces (to the guy-table) that he's gay. We're playing cards at the time, and our responses ranged from: ""Cool,"", to ""Finally...,""

Well APPARENTLY, we didn't show enough support because he seemed upset that we weren't caught completely by surprise.

Him: Why can't you people just accept me for who I am?

(We stare at each in confusion)

Me: Uh... we don't care. You're gay? Fine. It's none of our business. (shrug)

Him: It's 2019. It's not okay to hate on gay people anymore. (he storms off)

Girl 1: (kicks my leg) What the hell's your problem?

Me: Everybody already knew he was gay.

Girl 1: SOOOO??? You could've showed that you were happy for him! GOD! (kicks my leg again)

Me: Kick me again, I dare you. (Spoiler: she doesn't)

The guys at the table give me a mixed bag of: ""You done fucked up now boi /s"" and ""SHUT UP, LET'S PLAY. LUNCH IS ALMOST OVER""

Nobody ever gave him crap for being gay, and as far I know, nobody outside our group ever gave him crap for it either.

[California] I cancelled tattoo appointment because the tattoo artist was high AF. They're slandering me on FB and refuse to pay back safety deposit,"I had an appointment for a huge tattoo that was estimated at about 2000$. When I made the appointment everything seemed fine and professional, and I made a safety deposit of 500$ which is not at all unusual.

When I turned up to the appointment a month later, I noticed the artist was super stoned (red eyes, reeking of weed, slurred speech...) to the point that I didn't feel comfortable getting tattooed by him. I requested a new appointment with another artist. The lady at the reception didn't understand my problem, became insulting and refused to offer me either my safety deposit back or a new appointment. Finally she called somebody else (higher up the chain apparently) on the phone who confirmed they would transfer the deposit back to my account. Stupidly I assumed the problem was resolved and left.

Not only didn't they not transfer it back, they proceeded to make an angry post on their facebook page about how 'some people' just cancel appointments without notice and then have the 'audacity' to demand their money back. For a few minutes the post included a link to my name until they presumably deleted it. 

So here I am with 500$ less and no tattoo, was I legally 'in the right' to refuse being tattooed by someone under the influence - like, would this count as a legit reason? I was honestly worried it would turn out shit. What do I do next?",legaladvice
The reason it's looked down upon for a woman to sleep with multiple men rather than vice versa is because it actually takes skill for a man to get with a woman.,"Now I want to start this by saying I don't give a shit who fucks who how many times, but it's obvious why men are slapped up and high-fived when they bring home a one night stand vs a woman being called a whore when she has multiple partners.

Women are picky af. Men aren't. It's in our genetics.

For a man to bring home a woman, even a promiscuous one, you need some game. You gotta have -

1. Good physical presentation, usually how you're dressed + how you actually look
2. You usually have to spend some amount of money.
3. You need to be able to produce good conversation that separates you from other men.
4. You usually need to be a couple levels above that woman (woman is a 6, guy is an 8)
5. A woman will probably ask for your occupation or field of study. A man will not care if you're a vomit collector (yes this is a job).

If a woman truly wants, she can just walk into a bar on Friday night, spend about 5 minutes scoping out the room, go up to a dude she likes, speak to him for another 10 minutes, and take him home while both are completely sober.

A man doing this? No way. It's like an epic quest that you invest most of your night into. And if you did a *very good* job, with the help of some alcohol (not wasted but slight buzz), you *may* get lucky.

There have been dating app experiments where they take a 10/10 man vs a 10/10 woman, and at the end the man who is a complete Adonis has 200/1000 matches, and the woman has 800+.

Thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. No one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

Anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. I told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). So the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

Caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result,"I went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while I was away. I came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. My oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. I thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. Took her to the ICU and the doctor ran a lot of tests. The doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. She was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. This caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. She suffered for two days in the ICU before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. There was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. I stayed by her side as they euthanized her. That was about 3 days ago. My heart is in pieces. 
There is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. But I have text messages of when I tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

(Update) The exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order,"You all thought it over.  So did I.  But no!  Turns out this story really could get weirder

Recap- years ago I took in an injured stray cat.  The cat was did not have a collar or chip.  A good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. After owning the cat for several years I began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  They demanded I return the cat and I refused and blocked them.  Eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  The letters demanded I pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  At this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

Someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. I ignored the first two but when they kept arriving I went ahead and did so.  I assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter I received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  This was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

So, to cut this already way too long story short, I filed a police report.  After some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  Okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

I will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but I'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  This is honestly the single dumbest thing I've ever gone through.

My cat continues not to care.

"UPDATE: I just recieved a demand letter from Enterprise Rent-a-Car stating that if I do not return their rental car, I will be charged with Embezzlement and Grand Theft Auto. I never rented a car from them. (San Jose, California)","Thank you to everyone for the advice. I'm also a SHE by the way (many of you thought I was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

After my initial post, I saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because Enterprise is the one at fault and I shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. So I did exactly this, and she told me that id I want her to give me more info, I would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that I am NOT the person who rented the car.  If not, she would report me for Embezzlement and Grand Theft to the Sacramento Police. Upon hearing this, I decided to file a report immediately online with the San Jose Police Department. I know many of you said I shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, I did not want to take any chances where I could end up with a warrant on my head.  I thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  After filing it, I emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  When I spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that I was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

On May 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. She showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had MY information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with CASH. (I thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) The manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the Sacramento Police later that afternoon. The following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as FRAUD, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  At this point, I was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. I then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to Sacramento see who the hell this woman is. However, turns out I didn't have to because 2 HOURS LATER...  
  
  
  
THE SAN JOSE POLICE DID SHOW UP KNOCKING ON MY FRONT DOOR. ( 2 Policemen and 2 CHP officers) Before opening it, the first thing I did was grab the copy of the police report I printed because I seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). When I open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if NAME OF WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW lives at my home? I tell them no, and that I have no idea who that is,  then they ask if I am ALYMG and I tell them that I am. They then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of Fremont that morning. The accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. They then show the license to me and it's an EXACT replica of MY DRIVERS LICENSE, and I ask them how this is possible if I have my license in my wallet? They then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (The black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) I then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from Enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when I hand them my report. I explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from Enterprise.  So basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. I told the officers that I have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. I then asked them who is the NAME OF THE WOMAN I DO NOT KNOW and they told me that she is the who stole the car. However, I'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we DO NOT look a-like at all. Idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. But after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

I do have her name now though, and After doing a google search I found her Facebook and other social media accounts. I'm very tempted to message her but I've decided to leave this to the police because I have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she DOES know where I live) However, I do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

Toxic Femininity is worse than Toxic Masculinity,"In recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic. The current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes, some for the better and some for the worse. But during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some. Women seem to want equality, but do not want to change their own bad behaviours.

When you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining, manspreading, sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument. The whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex.

But when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up. A lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity. A few examples being;

* Blaming behavioural issues on periods
* Acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
* Coercing men into sex who didn't seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because ""men always want it""
* Backed up by studies, women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves, others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
* Being physically abusive to men while expressing ""men can't hit women"" and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
* Lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
* Manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child.

&#x200B;

Some of these examples are minor toxic offences, like blaming bad behaviour on hormones. It's normal, it happens, but it is no excuse all the same. Some of these examples are major toxic offences. Such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way.

One of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist.

"Step Father's grandson is ""home-schooled"" by his daughter. Child is 8 years old, can't count beyond 20. Doesn't fully know the alphabet, and doesn't really know how to play/interact with other kids because he spends most of his time at home in a small apartment.","(Note I say step father but my mom is not married to him. They live separately but I still call him my step dad)  

His daughter used to live with him until my step dad demanded she get a job or go to school. she instead left with her son and moved in with and married her boyfriend. It was around this time that he had to start preschool, and she said that she was going to home school him and she's been home schooling him ever since. 

Fast forward three years and their relationship has gotten better so she'll occasionally drop him off to visit. He's 8 now and I've noticed how far behind he is. I'm a High school senior and do a lot of volunteering at elementary schools. So when he comes to visit I like to spend my time teaching him. I taught him the basic alphabet, first couple numbers, etc. These are things he should know already. He learns very quickly and enjoys it. So I don't suspected he has any learning disabilities. I also read to him and once gave him a book as a gift. 

A few visits later while talking to him I come to find out that all he knows is what I've taught him and that the book I gave him is the only thing he's been reading because that's the only book he owns. He also tells me that he doesn't do ""learning time"" with his mom. ( ""learning time"" is what I call it when I teach him )

My friend has a younger brother the same age so I'll have her bring him over when he's visiting. While they play he acts like he's a toddler compared to him. I didn't think much of it until  my friends little brother asked him if he has any friends and he said no. He tells him that he stays at home all day. 

My step father notices this, and so does my mom and friend. We didn't say anything to each other not wanting to be rude or sound paranoid but the conversation came up and my step dad admitted he's been feeling horrible about it ever since. He wants to take action but doesn't want to get his daughter in trouble. She's living off welfare and I forgot to mention that she's legally blind. ( not completely but enough to give her disability ) He's also scared she won't let him see his grandson anymore if he mentions it. 


I'm really worried about him but I don't know what can be done and neither does my step dad. He doesn't care for her and only wants what's best for his grandson. He would want to get custody but he works two jobs at the moment and wouldn't have the time to care for him. 

We live in Nevada. Clark County District. What happens if we call CPS? Is there any legal way to make her enroll him in school? And is there a chance that if they see she's not educating him that they'll take him away?",legaladvice
[UPDATE] 1 year later- I [28F] gave my boyfriend [28M] an engagement ultimatum and I might be regretting it,"Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/7sj9d2/i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

TL;DR: My boyfriend and I have been together for 4.5 years, moved to a new city together, and live together, but I had not been able to get him to have a serious discussion about where the relationship is going/whether he sees us getting married (I've known that I want to marry him for about 2 years, so I've been trying to bring up the topic for about that long). I was getting frustrated, (I would like to have kids, and my time to do so is limited) so I told him in September that we needed to be engaged by 3/31/18 (when our lease expired) or I was going to move out.

&#x200B;

Update #1 here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/861lrl/update\_i\_28f\_gave\_my\_boyfriend\_28m\_an\_engagement/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/861lrl/update_i_28f_gave_my_boyfriend_28m_an_engagement/)

TL;DR: Written 10 days prior to the ultimatum deadline, my boyfriend said he wasn't planning to propose. His asked me to stay with him and assured me that he would propose in December 2018 if I visited his family in their home in September and he spoke with them about his plan to propose to me. His reasoning was that I had to visit his family in their home before he felt comfortable taking the next step (I had spent time with his parents in the past, so this didn't make sense to me). I was frustrated but planning to stick to my guns.

&#x200B;

Now, on to the current update:

***March 2018***: I couldn't go through with the ultimatum. I was planning to move out, actually found a new apartment, and wrote the check for the deposit. But when push came to shove, I couldn't picture my life without my boyfriend. I decided that I loved him too much to leave him over the arbitrary deadline that I had created. I also believed that he meant what he said about getting engaged in December. I felt I was being silly for leaving him after 4.5 years because I wouldn't wait another few months. As a compromise, he said we could get a cat (I had been wanting one but he'd been saying no), and he said he'd go to at least one family event with me this year. On 3/31, the day I was planning to move out, we got a cat together.

&#x200B;

***April-September 2018***: My boyfriend and I spent time enjoying each other without really mentioning the ultimatum. We both needed to recover from the damage it did to our relationship. I got a therapist and started working on myself. I picked up a new hobby (running), developed new friendships, and spent a lot of time working on my career and hanging out with my amazing new cat. I think focusing on myself/my career/my friendships took some of the pressure off of him. Also, multiple family events came and went, and my boyfriend had an excuse not to attend each one. I'm not sure it was that big of a deal anyway. By the end of the summer, we were doing great and it was like the ultimatum never happened. He also complaints about our cat constantly.

&#x200B;

***September 2018- visiting his family***: As I promised him, I went to visit his parents in their home in September. As I mentioned in the previous post, he is Chinese-American (and I'm white), so I studied up on my basic Chinese and was able to speak/understand a little when we were all together. It was a great trip, and I genuinely enjoyed his parents and had a lot of fun in his hometown. I left a few days before he did so that he'd have time to spend with them alone (and speak with them about his plans for us in the future). I asked him a few times how that conversation went, and he said that they are happy with us having a future together, but that getting engaged in December would be ""too fast."" That seemed absolutely crazy to me, and again it seemed like he was projecting his own views onto his parents. He also told me I needed to learn Chinese before we got married (his parents speak perfect English but prefer Chinese when they are with family), so I started doing Rosetta Stone.

&#x200B;

***October-December 2018***: Around November, I started getting antsy that my boyfriend was going to change his mind again. He was starting to show his pattern of making excuses. For instance, one day he casually mentioned that he couldn't propose by December because he needed to save money (we share finances and money is not an issue for either of us). Another time, he freaked out that I have student loans (most people in my profession do, and I have a very secure job, good pay, and automatic loan payments), and demanded that he see a spreadsheet of my finances before he could consider having a future together. Luckily I already have this spreadsheet, which I showed him, and he calmed down.

In the meantime, my friends and family were starting to ask questions about the future wedding. Although they had the best intentions, it was stressing me out because I was worried that after all this, there would be no wedding. I worked with my therapist on letting go of this stress, redirecting my family away from relationship questions. I also created a ""no nagging"" rule in my mind-- I stopped dropping hints, mentioning wedding/engagement, etc with my boyfriend (didn't do it much anyway, as I had learned my lesson from the ultimatum). We spent Christmas together for the first time this year, and I really thought he would propose then. But he didn't, and I didn't bring it up or pout about it. He visited his family for New Years and I was left in our city working, so it definitely didn't happen then.

&#x200B;

***January 2019:*** I accepted that he actually didn't follow through with what he said he would do, despite me holding up my end of the deal. I was the perfect girlfriend that he asked me to be, and I tried to use this an an opportunity for growth (both individually and within the relationship), and still nothing changed. I was still on the momentum of not nagging him and trying to suppress all of my thoughts of wanting to marry him. It's now to the point that I equate my own thoughts of marrying him with shame and self-loathing, like they are bad thoughts that I shouldn't have. I realize I've been feeling so embarrassed with my own desires for my future, which is so sad. But a few things have happened in the past few weeks that have made me realize that this is all bullshit. First, one of my superiors at work offered me some great opportunities at my job if I stay onboard long term. However, my boyfriend wants to think about moving us out of the city we live in because ""we don't like it here"" (I am actually okay with it for the most part). He also has given a hard NO to ever moving back to my home state (his reason: my family lives there and they annoy him). I started thinking 'wow, this person is putting a lot of limits on my life for someone who still can't commit to me for the long term.'

Then, this weekend I went back to my home state for my best friend's baby shower. Also, I want to have kids, that's the main reason I am in any hurry to get married (biological clock is ticking). So yesterday, I was hanging out with my friend and her husband, helping them set up their nursery, and I had this ""Aha!"" moment where I realized that it's okay for me to want to get married and have kids. There's no shame in having my own wants. And at this point, not only have my wants/desires been shut down by my boyfriend (No marriage, we can't stay in the city where I have job opportunities, we also can't live in my home state where my entire family is), but I've internalized this sense of shame about expressing or feeling anything that conflicts with HIS desires. So I'm starting to form a plan to move on, because this dude is taking more from my life that he's adding to it.

&#x200B;

I'm hoping to get anyone's opinion/advice/support about where to go from here. Also I am willing to hear all the ""I told you so'"" from everyone who said I needed to leave this guy in March when I said I would. I totally deserve it. Thanks for reading!

&#x200B;

***UPDATE***: Wow, thank you Reddit for the super thoughtful replies! I read each one (so far)! 

I spoke with my boyfriend last night about all of this. I started by asking what his roadblocks are and where he sees the relationship going. He brought up the fact that it's moving too fast for his parents, and some issues that he has with the relationship: 1. That we don't make decisions together (e.g. the fact that I want to stay in our city for career opportunities despite him wanting to move next year, also sometimes I make plans to hang out with friends on weekends when he is free instead of us planning the weekends together), 2. He worries about  the fact that I get a lot of Amazon packages and he doesn't know what I am buying (showed him my Amazon history, it's mostly household supplies that we both use, and occasional supplies for my hobby, but that's like $20/mo max). Also this is all on my credit card (which I comfortably pay off each month) so I don't think I need to clear every purchase by him, and 3. He also doesn't like that I'm chronically 5 minutes late to everything (that's true and my fault). Also, since it came up a lot in the comments, I wanted to mention that he explicitly said that none of this has to do with cultural barriers or the fact that we're an interracial couple. 

However, after all this, he said he's not ready for marriage. I was pretty pissed and told him I wished he told me this a year ago so I could have moved on. He basically tried to keep me around for another year so that he would have more time to figure out if he was ready. So I told him the relationship is over, and he is appearing to be in disbelief. He's trying to be really nice now (probably to get me to change my mind), but I'm remaining gently firm here.",relationship_advice

TIFU by not knowing courtrooms had dress codes.,"For those of you that are as unaware as I am, don't wear shorts, flip flops, or hats into court. I went to go pay a ticket (expired tags) at my scheduled time and saw ""NO SHORTS, FLIP FLOPS, HATS, UNTUCKED SHIRTS..."" in bold letters on the door. Fortunately for me, the front desk had extra slacks on hand for this very thing. Unfortunately for me, the slacks were a size 32, and I haven't been a size 32 since high school... I'm a big guy who's been ""blessed"" with thick thighs (heard they're in style). These slacks were so tight, I couldn't zip them past the first rung. All I could do was throw my belt on, cinch it tight, and throw my shirt over it all to hide the undesirables. These things looked like yoga pants on me.

I'd guess about 30 people were in the court room, spread out amongst the benches. I was capable of slipping behind everyone without them seeing and sitting on the back bench. One lady enters right before go time and asks me to scoot back so she could get by. I said ""Ma'am, if I bend my legs I'll bust these pants wide open."" She looks down, sees my pants and starts snickering, then steps over me. 

After the judge said his speech, he began to call people 1 by 1 as they said their plea. He allowed us to stand where we were and shout our plea towards him (WIN). Everyone before me requested a conference. I was fourth to be called. 

Judge: ""QTVain how do you plea?""

Me: ""Guilty, sir. I would just like to pay my ticket.""

Judge: ""Alright, that's 100 dollars, please step up to the front, sign this document and the officer will escort you to the cashier.""

Me: *panicking* ""Uh yes, sir""

As I'm waddling up to the front, it really dawned on me that I looked like a bum off a three day bender. Flip flops (that were clearly not allowed), the tightest pants you've ever seen on a man, and an untucked t-shirt. I'm starting to hear people fighting back laughter as I walk by every damn bench.

Judge: ""Didn't meet the dress code huh?""

Me: ""Sir, these people behind me know more about my body than I do right now. I'd really like to pay my ticket and go.""

Judge: ""Ha, fair enough. Get outta here.""

I waddled out of there as quickly as I could and threw my shorts on in the bathroom. Told my wife what happened when I got home. ""Yah I thought it was weird you went into court with shorts, I was going to tell you but forgot.""

""Thanks babe.""


TL;DR Check your local courts dress code before attending. I didn't, and wore the wrong attire. 

Edit: Hey y'all, I get it. I should have thought about it. I'm just your standard law-abiding citizen who has never experienced the inside of a courtroom before. Can we not be so hostile? I was just trying to show the judge a little leg.

Edit 2: I'm trying to respond to all of y'all asking me questions. To further clarify, I thought I had to show up to the courthouse to pay the ticket, I didn't actually believe I had to see the judge. I was headed to work after the visit, and my job has a really, really lax dress code. Hope this helps, my fingers are getting tired.

Edit 3: Thank y'all for the gold! I've honestly enjoyed chatting with so many of you. Reddit, you're beautiful (even the random little shit stains that comment). I tried to respond to as many of you as I could. My fingers are actually hurting now. I'll comment more tomorrow. ",tifu

Houseguest had a deadbolt installed after being reminded that he'll have to leave soon. Questions about the situation in general but specifically the locksmith's liability here. (Update),"TL;DR - things kind of managed to sort themselves out

So I got a call while I was getting ready to head back to the apartment to meet the locksmith. It was Pete's brother. Apologies for the lack of details here but I don't know too much about exactly what went down, and a chunk of what I do know is sort of personal shit that the brother, who just did me an enormous favor, probably wouldn't want me sharing. Anyway, the gist of the phone call was that he went by and performed a third party constructive eviction with the back of his hand. So Pete's gone, as is most of his stuff. His brother is going to swing by next week to grab any odds and ends that they may have missed. I am planning on making him dinner and hitting him off with a bottle of good whiskey when he does so.

As far as Pete goes, I'm thinking that I'll follow through with at least the early part of the eviction process just in case he tries anything cute. Gonna speak to my attorney about this first, but he's still in the wind. Turns out he's staying at a cabin his girlfriend's family owns and it's pretty much as close to being in the middle of nowhere as human-built structures get. His admin/paralegal... I dunno what she is specifically, but she said that yesterday was the one day he wasn't going into town for cell service. This gives us the opportunity to convince him that the situation is currently way worse than it ever was, and as much as I love this guy, he's really fun to fuck with so that's cool. 

After speaking with him I called the owner of the locksmith to let him know that the apartment was vacant, so his guy wouldn't need to show up with police. Turns out he was planning on coming by to handle this himself anyway, so that was easy enough. I met him over there, he had a handful of deadbolts for me to choose from, and he switched out the lock in about five minutes. We got to bullshitting about baseball because that's what you do in New York, and this led to him accepting my offer to buy him a beer so we could watch the White Sox smack our Yankees around. I got some backstory at the bar, and while this is secondhand information, the dude seems pretty reliable so I've got no reason not to believe him. 

The guy who came over yesterday morning was indeed an employee of his, but he wasn't on the clock and actually ""borrowed"" the deadbolt without mentioning anything. Turns out he is an old friend of Pete's, and had been fed a story about an insane landlord who had decided to move into the apartment Pete was renting. Brilliant. Anyway, my new locksmith buddy told me that this guy was officially unemployed as of that afternoon. I'd feel bad for the dude but I'm too busy not caring about what his motivation was due to the complete and total lack of any attempt to verify the story he'd been fed. This also explains the the non-answers I got when I called the shop - the person I spoke to was a manager who had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. He was basically trying to buy some time to speak with the owner and the guy who installed the deadbolt instead of just pulling an excuse out of his ass for me. I wish he'd told me that in the first place but I do appreciate the fact that he didn't just try to go into CYA mode for the company/his (now former) co-worker. All in all, I have a new preferred locksmith for when I need something done at any of my properties. 

So really the only legal shit left is the restraining order, and Pete very kindly sent my wife a few emails last night upon figuring out that she'd blocked his number. Not gonna go into detail but I'll just say that the contents should make the restraining order easy to get. 

So thank for all of the help and well wishes, but it seems like this is more or less a wrap, and a pretty amusing one too. My wife's gone from upset about the whole thing to uncharacteristically indignant, which she's admitted is kind of cathartic for her, so I don't even have a reason to feel guilty about laughing about what a moron Pete is!

Again, thanks all.",legaladvice

To girls who friendzone guys: they're not obligated to keep being your friend,"I say this as a gay man who sees this with many of my female friends. 

If you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. Some guys want to date you plain and simple. These guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. These guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. But it's not the same as a platonic friendship. If you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things: 

1) Stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) Not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems. 

He's under no obligation to be your friend just like you're under no obligation to date him. This also applies to men who friendzone their female friends.",unpopularopinion

AITA for pointing out that my co-worker is trans/doesn't pass?,"Alright.

I'm a European woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to San Francisco for a fancy-pants internship. It was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- I'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time I've ever been out at work.

There is one co-worker who we shall call Linda. She's a trans woman (MtF).

Linda's position means that me and she and I don't really interact at work often. Therefore, I was told about her before I met her. One of my co-workers told me that she existed, I was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. I met Linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, I thought that was the end of it.

Now, Linda does not pass as a cis woman.  She's still a woman and I'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.

This now caused an issue. A few of us had a Halloween get-together and invited Linda. At some point, she and I were alone at our table. We got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative European country. At some point, I made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.

Her face just fell. She started hissing at me about how dare I presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (I did NOT misgender her, at no point did I use 'he' or anything like that- I just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. Drunk idiot I was, I blurted out 'but...we all know?' Which we do.

I was extremely confused. Apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. This somehow led Linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.

Linda now, and I say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. She confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare I judge her. I, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. She is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.

"AITA for telling an anorexic girl to ""stay the fuck away from my girlfriend""","I've been dating my girlfriend for almost three years now (M18) (F17). Since she's considered a minor medically she was put into a youth anorexia program for her eating disorder.

A girl was admitted last week for severe eating disorder, I'm taking fights nurses, refuses to eat and threatens to harm herself if they make her eat. My girlfriend told me that the girls been anorexic since she was 9, she's 17 now and has made zero progress according to her parents (she overheard, they share a room).

A few days ago my girlfriend mentioned that she's been trying to make friends with the new girl but she makes her severely uncomfortable. Basically telling her that she looks perfect the way she was and that gaining weight was going to make her unattractive to me. Shes also been telling her things like ""Why do you want to get better, you look so healthy"" and ""Wow your boyfriend must have loved your body, it's a shame"".

I eventually mentioned to a nurse that my girlfriend should be moved out of that environment ASAP and was moved to a different room yesterday. A few hours ago I went to visit and the girl basically confronted me and told me that I was an asshole for taking away her friend.

But here goes: My wife will not shut up.  I'm not talking about your usual Chatty Cathy.  I mean she (almost) literally will NOT. SHUT. UP.  She will talk continuously from the moment she knows I am within earshot.  Not just in the same room.  I mean as soon as it's reasonable to assume that I can hear her.  She will not *stop* talking until I'm gone, and sometimes not even then.  On more than one occasion, I've gone into the bathroom, turned on the loud exhaust fan, taken a leisurely dump, and then returned to hear her cheerfully engaged in the same ""conversation"" she was enjoying before I went in.  She also refuses to *use* the exhaust fan while she's in the restroom because it would prevent her from being heard.  So I get to hear ALL the bathroom noises on top of whatever Homeric Epic about her friend's cousin's girlfriend's hairdresser she's blathering on about.  
  
I once drove from Tampa, FL to Chicago, IL with her (before we were married- I'm such an idiot!) without saying more than ten sentences.  She did not stop talking the entire way.  The ENTIRE way.  
  
Television on to a show I like?  Pfft.  That's not a problem.  She'll happily turn the volume down so it doesn't get in the way.  Having sex?  That's the perfect time to tell me about how Olivia Newton John still has the leather pants she wore in Grease and she- brace yourself- STILL fits in them!  Really!  Needless to say, we don't go to the movies.  Ever.  I've been shushed out of too many theaters.   
  
I get it.  She grew up in a huge Italian Catholic family in the Bronx.  If you don't talk loud and constantly, you don't get to talk at all.  I, on the other hand, grew up in a Scandinavian family with two children.  To this day, I'm not sure we ever *had* a conversation in our house.  I actually often wonder if that's what made me attractive to her.  I was taught to politely listen to people and then wait for them to finish before replying.  She never finishes (or takes a breath it sometimes seems), so to her I'm paying rapt attention to her no matter how much she talks.  
  
That's not true, though.  Another difference between people of Swedish heritage is that we don't use ""filler"" words for acknowledgement.  Other than the Minnesotan ""naaaaah,"" (useful on every occasion!) we're pretty much silent when we listen to others.  No ""uh huh"" or ""yeah"" or ""omg!"" needed.  A nod of the head every ten minutes or so is all you need to convey your attentiveness.  I think it has a lot to with living in the frigid North.  You keep your mouth open as much as my wife does, and your teeth are going to shatter from the cold.    
  
To her, that's like being in the room with a dead person.  She's always stopping to ask ""are you even listening?"" or say ""you never pay attention to me!"" or even quiz me with ""what did I just say?""  I've become an expert at storing the last two to four words she says and parroting them back at her.  She'll be like ""blah blah blah ... and then she told him she wasn't taking that kind of crap anymore,"" and I'll go ""that kind of crap?"" as if I had any idea what kind of crap it was or who it was that wouldn't take it anymore.  And she'll say ""yeah!"" and think I've been paying attention the whole time.  
  
I joke about it a lot, but it's actually getting to the point where it's a problem.  Our son is seven years old, and he has developed a pronounced stutter because she interrupts him constantly.  Growing up in her house, if anyone paused even for a millisecond, that was grounds for talking over them.  And you talked loud so they didn't finish.  My son apparently inherited some of my less ""staccato"" speech patterns, and she basically just uses that to interrupt and take over the conversation.  It got so bad that he started automatically stopping and restarting words, even when not being interrupted.  I didn't know that was considered a stutter until we went to one of those parent/teacher night things, and a teacher listened to wife and then turned to me and said ""well at least now I know why Josh has a stutter.""  Just like that.  
  
She's failed at least one job interview because of this.  I know because I lined it up with a business acquaintance myself.  He called me up and said sorry, but he just couldn't take being in the same room with her because she wouldn't stop talking.  
  
We rarely are invited for a second ""couples date.""  She monopolizes the conversation every time we go out with other people.  Who wants more than one does of that?  
  
You're probably wondering: ""well, have you *told* her about this?""  Yes.  Many times.  Sometimes jokingly.  Sometimes with utter seriousness.  The reactions vary from anger (talks louder, higher, faster, and uses lots more swear words) to tears (she's the only person I know who can carry on a totally unrelated conversation while sobbing hysterically).  The one thing that doesn't happen is her talking any less.  
  
I try not to let it get to me.  She's a very affectionate woman.  Loves me to death.  Mother of my child.  Pretty as the day we met- prettier, even.  We still get plenty of ""alone time,"" (granted, she won't shut up while we're doing it, but I'm pretty busy so I don't really notice as much).  But it *does* get to me.  It's selfish and shows a lack of self awareness.  There's a time and a place for enthusiastic conversation, and they're not ""always"" and ""everywhere.""  
  
I know the answer to the problem: I have to ""talk back.""  In effect, the only thing that possibly *could* shut her up is for me to do the same thing as she does.  I would have to interrupt at the slightest pause.  I would have to talk louder- yelling if necessary- when she tries to interrupt me.  I would have to learn to use Italian Hand Gestures to emphasize my points and chop off her objections.  But I'm not Italian.  I'm a waspy pale dude who grew up in a household that would have made a mortuary sound like a middle school cafeteria.  
  
Twelve years of this has finally pushed me to the brink.  I'm not sure I can take it that much longer.  I'm just not sure if I could get a word in to tell the judge why I'm there in his divorce court.  My wife wouldn't let me.  
  
tl;dr: Wife will not shut up.  Is that reasonable grounds for leaving her?  
  
EDIT: Obligatory Reddit ""omg I had no idea this would blow up.""  Which is true.  I thought maybe a couple of people would just call me an asshole and that would be it.  But RIP, Inbox.  It was nice to know ya.  So in the interest of not replying to *every* comment, I will try to address some of the common ones and answer some of the questions I saw popping up multiple times.  
  
Also thanks for the (often hilarious) advice.  
  
Q1 - Is this BS? (implied)  
A1 - No, it's all mostly true.  I admit to some embellishment for dramatic/comedic effect, though.  The bit about the leather pants is representative, not an actual quote.  Not from sexy times, anyway.  She probably mentioned it at some point, though.  
  
Q2 - Why didn't you run away screaming *before* you got married?  (sub-question: was OP's wife hot?)  
A2 - Yes, she is hot.  And funny.  And vivacious.  Also, I really *was* a ""nordic silent bear"" (thanks, /u/Sarah_Dragonfire), my wife drew me out of my shell.  And if I'm brutally honest with myself: when you're young and getting laid on the regular, a LOT of things don't seem all that terrible.  [Damn you, Penis!  This is all your fault!]  
  
Q3 - Did your kid really develop a stutter because of this?  
A3 - Medically speaking, I cannot state this with 100% certainty.  The cause was never formally diagnosed.  However, I watched it happen first hand.  I'm not a qualified speech therapist, but I think it was a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the observations I made.  I'd welcome a dissenting opinion from an actual professional though, if only to salve my conscience.  Which leads to:  
  
Q4 - Aren't *YOU* really the one responsible for your kid's stutter?  After all, you did nothing to stop it.  
A4 - Guilty.  And I feel utterly like shit about it all the time.  For the record, I did bring it up lots of times even to the point of getting into arguments about it and speaking harshly to my wife when she interrupted my son.  But I think by the time I realized it was happening most of the damage was done.  And anything I could do was more expressing my anger about it than actually making an effective change.  All the rest of this weirdly long post is just ranting.  If there's an actual justification for leaving, this is it (and I'm deathly afraid that she'll get full custody and just make it worse or even irreparable).    
  
Q5 - Is it because she's (pick one: OCD, insecure, autistic, mentally ill, ...)?  
A5 - I don't think so, although I've always sensed an overwhelming need for attention.  I see it in her family dynamic, in that all of her many siblings were in constant competition for their parents' attention and affection.  
  
Q6 - Have you tried counseling?  
A6 - No.  Probably should have, but I know her well enough that even mentioning it would shatter her.  It's bizarre that I can't bring myself to do a lot of things people have suggested (and believe me, I've probably thought of all of them) because they just seem too cruel to me.  And yet, I'm seriously considering divorce.  I realize the contradiction there.  ",relationship_advice

I (28M) ruined my girlfriends (23F) family's favorite movie and now they hate me,"For the last year and a half I've been dating a girl I met through a friend. We get along extremely well- we both love movies, the same music, stand up
comedians, I'm an avid filmmaker and she likes to edit- everything has been great. 
She's not from around here and we decided to fly out and have me meet her family for the first time. It's been going relatively well in my opinion, but tonight we decided to watch their favorite movie: The Fourth Kind.
For those that don't know, it's an alien abduction movie that tries to act like all of the events are 110% true. I'd never seen it so they wanted to show me. Halfway through the movie her dad said something along the lines of ""I wonder why this wasn't a big deal when it happened?"" To which I said ""well the movie is fake- them saying the events were real is a bunch of shit."" 
Apparently for the last 10 or so years they've believed that the movie was true. The whole family immediately freaked out at me- her dad kicked me out of the house and now I'm waiting to fly back home a week and a half early. I've tried to call my girlfriend but she hasn't said anything to me yet. What should I do to remedy the situation?


Update nearly 24 hours later: girlfriend and I have talked- her and her family got in a huge fight after I left and came home. Apparently her dad was mainly upset of my Polish heritage (they're Swedish so I guess there's bad blood there? I'm not too caught up on that) and me pointing out that The Fourth Kind is fake was just kind of the tipping off point. She agrees that her family is kind of crazy too.

Being sued for helping a choking victim (OR),"I was eating at a diner with some friends at 3 am, the guy in the booth next to us started coughing and gagging. I realized he was choking and went to help him, I had Heimlich training at my place of work (I'm office safety manager for my floor). The guy managed to get the thing out and it flew across the booth. He looked really pissed, payed his bill and left. I felt like a little hero the rest of the dinner and then just kinda forgot about it. This was two weeks ago.
 
Today I got a letter from a law firm that I'm getting sued for battery, they said I bruised a rib, I have no clue how this guy figured out who I am. I thought I helped the guy seeing as he probably would have choked without help. How did he figure out who I am? I never actually spoke to him. Is this a real letter? Do I need a lawyer for this?

"Was I(25m) wrong for telling my wife (24f) ""If I'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you.""","First, some back story. Sorry, little bit of a long one. My wife(24f) and I(25m) have been married for almost two years, but have been together for over seven years. Shortly after we moved in together, about two years into our relationship, I learned my wife has an issue with getting these whiskers that grow on her chin. She told me it was because of a hormonal imbalance, but she was very good at plucking or waxing them so I wouldn't notice. She was very self conscious about them, so she tried to make sure they weren't present as often as possible. I completely understood that it was out of her control that it occurs, and I hardly even noticed because she kept on top of it so well.

Day one of when we started dating, she made it very clear to me that she hates beards on the men that she's with. She thinks they're very unattractive. Well, not on every guy. She likes beards on certain actors. But definitely not on me. So I have stayed clean shaven for her. If I even forget to shave, even for a couple days, she won't even kiss me because she hates the beard that much. She'll usually comment on it multiple times a day until I do shave. Progressively getting worse until I do the deed. But it's whatever, having to shave often doesn't bother me. I'm in the habit now of shaving every day or at least every other. If I could, I'd probably try to grow it out and see how I look with a legit beard, but my wife would definitely not allow it.

Back to the my wife's whiskers: since we've gotten married, my wife has gotten.. Comfortable. These whiskers of hers; she now goes weeks, even a month + without plucking them. After a whole month, these 5-10 whiskers are as long as the hair on my head (I have average length hair). Now, I love my wife to death, no matter what she looks like, I want that to be clear. But these whiskers: I'm not a fan of them. They're not soft, barely visible hairs, they're long, shiny, and resemble thick fishing line.

She gets on me about my appearance, especially my facial hair. After a month of her not taking care of her issue, I finally said in the most loving way I could ""Hey, babe, your whiskers are getting kinda long. Your coworkers might notice, maybe you should pluck them or something?"" She got quite offended. But, she took care of the problem. A few weeks go by, and once again, she let her whiskers get long. I make another suggestion that she should take care of them, this time, she completely shrugs me off. Says she's ""too tired and will do it later."" Keep in mind, she bought a handheld battery operated hair puller thing for this very purpose. It gets rid of the problem in under 20 seconds. I make a suggestion again a few days later, adding in very kindly that I love her, and don't much care how she looks, but I'm not a fan of them. Which again, she was offended, but took care of it. Now I'm stuck in this cycle of she let's it grow, I suggest to get rid of them, she ignores me, then I have to mention it more and more times before she does something about it. Always getting pissed off that I dare say something. It's at the point where if I don't say anything, she won't do it.

A few days ago. She was ripping me a new one because I wanted to have sex, but I haven't shaved my beard for a few days, and she didn't want to do anything since I was ""too scruffy."" It's been about three weeks since she's plucked her whiskers so they're at least an inch long. I snap and say ""this is bullshit, I shave almost every day for you. To look my best for you. But you won't get rid of those things on your chin once every couple weeks for me, even though I've kindly told you I don't like them."" and I finish with ""If I'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."" Needless to say, she was incredibly pissed and we did not have sex that night. We're okay now. I've shaved since then. She has not.

Was I wrong to have said this? Was I wrong to look at this as a double standard? Should I have approached this differently?

* Update 1: some of you recommended laser hair removal or a similar permanent hair removal process. We have talked about laser hair removal in the past for her. She seemed interested, at first, but then made an excuse along the lines that she'd ""have to go back for multiple sessions and doesn't have the time for that."" I haven't tried to bring it up since.
* Update 2: some are asking if it's the look of the beard or the fact it's rough and scratchy she doesn't like. In this case, both. She says she doesn't like how I look with a beard. I've never had a beard while I've been with her, so how she came to that conclusion, I do not know. Hell, I don't even know what I look like with a legit beard. Earlier in the relationship, if I had stubble, and kiss her, she'd comment that it ""scratches and it's uncomfortable."" Which frankly, I understand. But then it evolved to her avoiding the kiss all together.
* Update 3: PCOS. Yes, she has it. She's known she's had it for a long time. I believe she was diagnosed with it before, or shortly after we first met. The hair growth probably is a side effect, and she has always handled it well. Up until recently.
* Update 4: everyone recommending I should post this in /r/AmItheAsshole. No can do. TIL that sub has a 3000 character limit. My post far exceeds that. Feel free to tell me if I'm the asshole here if you like.
* Update 5: thank you to those of you that have commented, or reached out to me, on different medications or procedures she could try that would help. I will definitely mention these to her. When the time is right of course. I appreciate you folks.
* Update 6: an **overwhelming** majority have suggested saying to her ""*I'll shave when you do.*"" That works for me. I'll definitely have an update to how that conversation goes.
* Update 7: ""*You shared this story with your guy friends!? You're a monster!*"" but sharing my story with thousands of strangers online is okay? Lol. I actually went into **far more** detail with you fine folks. I only shared this argument with two of my very close friends.

[UPDATE] Someone I've never met claims they own my house," Hi everyone –
 
I can't thank you enough for all your advice on my last post: ""Someone I've never met claims they own my house"".  This is the first update, and I'm hopeful there will just be one more after this, wrapping everything up so we can put this behind us.  This is what has happened since my last post:
 

After the initial letter from the law firm saying they can represent us, we started getting phone calls from other firms, saying they'd been alerted to the Lis Pendens and could also represent us.  We were not super happy with this and asked how they got our cell number.  They said they subscribe to a service that alerts them when things like liens, foreclosures etc. are filed on a property. We hung up.
 

We looked at all our documents from the closing and confirmed that we do indeed have homeowner's title insurance (yay!).  Our deed is a ""Bargain and Sale"" deed, for those wondering. We also pulled all deed/mortgages and other documents for our property going back to 1972 online.  The last action was when we bought our house – no documents have been filed since.  I signed up on ACRIS to be alerted to any changes made to the property documents (thank you for the redditor who suggested that).  I also emailed the DA for my county, and their economic crimes bureau head emailed me back to ask for my cell number to follow up with me.  I gave it to him, but he hasn't called yet, so maybe that will be in the next (and hopefully final) update.

 
My husband met with our lawyer this morning, and I asked him to speak about all the things that you all suggested in the last post. Prior to the meeting, our lawyer had reached out to the firm who filed the Lis Pendens, and actually got a copy of the court transcript where the con man said he owns our property.  According to the transcript, he claims he bought it in 2016.  Our lawyer called their law firm and basically said ""Where is the deed?""  They supposedly hemmed and hawed about it, so we're starting to think they don't have it, and never did!  They may just be going off the words of a sleezeball who's like ""Yeah, I totally own that place.  I even have a deed for it.  No, you can't see it.""  It's possible that based off this alone, they filed against our property. 
 

In addition, it's not like this guy is saying he bought our house last week and the paperwork just hasn't been filed yet, he claims he bought it 3 YEARS AGO and there is STILL no paperwork filed to attest to this fact. (I was able to pull up all records for our home going back nearly 50 years, in about 15 minutes online).  Our lawyer does not like the way this other firm is handling this, and basically said to them ""You have no grounds for this.  Take it off.""
 

The attorney handling this case at that law firm is out of the office today and tomorrow,  but will be calling our lawyer back on Friday.  I am hopeful that it will just be a matter of ""Take the Lis Pendens off."" And ""Ok"".  I'll update again after the call between the lawyers. I told my husband the number 1 question is ""Where. Is. The. Deed?""  When we initially spoke with them, they clearly said they had it in hand, which is part of the reason I was freaking out. I honestly just want to be done with this, so getting back at the suing law firm for gross negligence (or whatever term fits the issue) is of no interest to me at the moment.  If they give us a hard time about removing the Lis Pendens, then we'll see.
 

So far my takeaway from this that I would share with anyone going through something similar is that law firms are made up of people.  And just like people can be good and smart and kind (like all of you!) they can also be dumb, shifty and lazy, and not bother to do their due diligence even though that's like 50% of why they exist in the first place (but I'm not bitter……).
 

Thank you all so much for your help,  I'll update again as things progress and hopefully conclude.",legaladvice

"[NC] Employer drug tested me, and also gave me a pregnancy test...?","I've been with my company for 2 years now. I recently applied for a different position, and got it. We're required to submit to a drug test any time we change positions, which is fine, I wasn't worried.

Our drug tests are done in house. Yesterday, I went to give my urine specimen, and was told by the HR woman to just leave it in the bathroom and go back to work, that she would check it in a second. 

Today, I get to work and my supervisor congratulates me on being pregnant, and tells me they'll be speaking to me about the position later. Bewildered, I asked what she meant. Apparently I was not only tested for drugs, but given a pregnancy test (not sure how, unless they literally dipped a stick in or used a dropper after the fact?) without my consent/knowledge. 

I left work almost immediately and bought tests on the way home. I am indeed pregnant and have NO desire to keep it, and will be scheduling an abortion ASAP. 

The other issue is that my supervisor KNOWS. I don't know who else. Unless I fake a miscarriage, they'll know I aborted and that seems like a ton of workplace drama I should have been able to avoid. 

Is this legal? What are my options here? I'm afraid when I go back to work, it'll be all over the factory and I'll have to figure out a lie.",legaladvice

AITA for asking to be charged for a man's haircut when I am a woman,"I am a butch lesbian and for the past 12 years I have had a short, men's style haircut. I'm not talking about a pixie cut that requires a lot of styling and time. My sides are buzzed fairly short with the top a bit longer. It usually only takes about 10- 15 minutes for me to get a haircut. During that time every salon I've gone to has charged me for a full price women's cut. This has always annoyed me and I don't enjoy paying almost double what men with the exact same haircut as me pay.

Recently I moved and yesterday I went to a new shop for my monthly trim and I decided to try something new. I asked if I could be charged the $22 for a men's cut rather than $40 for a woman's cut. The woman at the counter looked like I slapped her. She called a manager and the stylist over and they seemed shocked by the suggestion. They talked about it among themselves and then told me it wasn't possible. I pushed back and explained my reasoning and all they would say was they don't charge by style. 12 years of frustration boiled over and I ended up leaving. I was never rude or mean, but I still feel bad that I wasted a stylist's appointment.

AITA for asking? Leaving? Being annoyed at what I see as a double standard?

I've thought about going to a barber, but I live in a conservative part of the country and I worry about a negative reaction there and every salon I've ever gone to explicitly caters to men as well.",AmItheAsshole
good news update! [CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"Mostly good news.

I worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

I got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. What my brother and I inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. My grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. She didn't do the same with mine before she died (I thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when I was old enough to know how to take care of them. There was no trust, she just trusted my dad. My dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. My dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

Dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. My brother found out I still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. That's how my brother found out I still had shares and they'd grown.

According to all that info my lawyer tells me I'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. I say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. The letter I received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

A week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. His girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. I felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures I might have given him some.

My wife (25f) let her idiot friend (28f) negligently discharge one of my (30m)rifles. I'm angry with both of them and my wife is acting like I'm being unreasonable. Advice?,"Obviously, I keep some guns. Just for hunting and sport shooting.

I've got four rifles right now and I keep them locked in a safe in my barn.

Before we got together two years ago, my wife had never really been around guns and at first wasn't too interested. After some time (and me explaining my philosophy on why I like to hunt), she has started to express an interest in learning to hunt for herself.

So over the last couple months I have been showing her how to handle and shoot a hunting rifle. Taking her to the range, doing some dry practice at home, etc. She's been learning a lot and doing a great job. And she has been very careful to follow proper safety on her firearms which makes me a little madder about the situation this morning.

She had a friend come over this morning. I already don't have a high opinion of this friend. I think she is kind of an idiot, but she's also got that unfortunate personality trait where she tends to be way overconfident and think she knows everything about any given subject. I've gotten into a few mild arguments with her over it. But she's at least harmless so I never worried about her too much.

So this friend came over today. I figured the ladies would just chill out or something and I kinda found my way outside to work on my car, mostly so I didn't get sucked into a conversation with the friend.

At some point I saw them leave the house and head to the barn, but I didn't think much of it. Half an hour later I heard a gunshot from inside the barn.

I freaked a little and ran into the barn. I found my wife and her friend, her friend holding one of my rifles, and they were both looking at me like they realized they really messed up.

In the immediate moment, after I saw the ladies were okay, I took my rifle out of friends hands and was mostly concerned with where the round had gone, luckily it just landed in the dirt a few yards away.

So with all that sorted, I wound up heading back inside and took my rifle back inside and got it put back away, and then with the immediate concern gone, I started to get mad.

I'm not necessarily proud of the language I used, but I'll try and portray it accurately since I am asking you alls opinions.

I asked the girls ""Why. The. *Fuck*. Was one of my guns pulled out?""

Friend didn't say anything at all, but my wife started explaining that friends husband wants to take her hunting sometime, so she was showing her a little bit about how to use a rifle.

So then I asked why it was loaded. I *know* I clear my guns before they go back in the safe, so I know there wasn't a round in there. And I keep my ammo in a whole different safe then the guns, which incidentally, was opened.

Wife explained again she was showing friend how to load it. Friend loaded it successfully, obviously, looked down the barrel, and ""accidentally"" pulled the trigger, according to my wife.

They were making a ""Woops!"" Face that kind ignorant upset me more. And it didn't help matters when my wife's friend started telling me that ""every rifle she is used to"" has a different kind of safety mechanism and-I don't know, I stopped listening to her there and told her it was probably best that she leave.

I locked up my guns and ammo, collected the keys from my wife and went back outside for a smoke. Friend takes off shortly after that and my wife approaches me.

She approached me and just said ""Sorry"". I was still mad so I told her something like ""Yeah...'sorry' isn't quite going to cut it here.""

And then I asked her what she was thinking, because she *knows* better than this. I know she knows better because I taught her!

I told her she made a string of very bad decisions that started with opening the gun safe, handing one of my rifles to someone who very obviously doesn't know how to handle it, then opening the ammo safe, *letting her load a fucking round* and then letting her swing it around!""

My wife started getting defensive. She told me I've taken her shooting on our property before. The effect was the same here, right.

I told her, yeah, we've gone and shot empty bottles and stuff, but we got out into the woods and do it in front of a hill that we know works as a backstop. We *dont* just load a gun and fire wherever!""

Wife told me that she *did* make sure her friend pointed in a safe direction at least, meaning out the door towards the ground. And I got a little mad again and said something along the lines of ""Yeah, and it's a good fucking thing you did or else one of us would probably be in a police car by now!""

My wife finally said it was just an accident and I didn't have to make such a deal over it, I told her that this was an accident that *would* have killed someone if her luck had been slightly less.

She walked away and as she did I said something to her like ""Do not go in the gun safe again without asking me."" She got re-pissed at that and asked why I'm treating her like I'm her ""dad"". I told her that those guns are registered to me and I don't want to go to jail if she hands it to someone who doesn't need to have it.

And thats where we've been all day. We're kind of just avoiding each other. That sort of argument is very uncharacteristic of my wife. She is generally a very responsible and level-headed woman and she is also pretty good about taking responsibility when she makes a mistake. This is the only real shouting-argument we've had and it really bothers me that she's throwing blame on me instead of recognizing how serious this mistake was.

Like if she had at least admitted that she made a serious mistake I probably would not have added that bit about staying out of my gun safe.

I *do* for myself feel bad for cussing at her, because I never do that. And what she said about me acting like her dad hit a nerve to. So I'll probably apologize for the cussing here once I'm a little less angry.

So what should I do to handle this now? First big argument, and my wife seems to want to downplay how big of a deal this is. I don't want to talk down to her, but I do, really want her to acknowledge what a bad decision(s) she made or I'm not sure I'll be able to trust her handling one of my guns again. There is also the matter of her friend. Like I said, my wife is normally a very responsible and mature woman, but when she gets around her friend it's like she gets......stupider, for lack of a better term. That is something that has bothered me about her friend before, but I've never said anything because it wasn't that big of a deal before.

How should I approach this? How do I get my wife to stop avoiding me right now for one, and how can I get her to recognize the seriousness here without her feeling like I'm trying to be her dad?

**TL;DR**: My wife pulled out one of my rifles without my permission, gave it to her friend, who then fired it negligently. I'm super pissed, wife is pissed that I'm pissed, and it's all a mess now. Help?",relationship_advice

TIFU By not washing my hair properly for over 10 years,"I have not clue when this FU started but I do know that I realised my error at the age of around 25, I'm currently 34.

I was recently reminded of this after seeing this particular [image](https://preview.redd.it/k4wt3q2b25a31.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27404351cf1bfa999bd9d068776855a4230687da) on another subreddit.


Backstory:


Like most children, I was bathed by my parents up until an age where they felt I was getting to old to have them help me, around 9, 10,11, or 12 (for a guess, god knows). I remember that both parents had taught me the importance of cleaning everywhere efficiently. I used to hate it when my father washed my hair. He used to scrub it so hard that it would shake my head and I could feel each of his fingers digging into my scalp when he did it.


After I was old enough to wash myself, as well as the usual instructions of what to make sure I had washed, he always told me to give my head a good scrub. It's only after realising my FU that I recalled my fathers instructions from all those years ago.

I can only presume that once I had the ability and trust to clean myself, I choose to ignore my fathers advice about washing the shampoo in deep and hard with my fingers. For many years I would use shampoo and just rub in onto my hair with the palms of my hands for an amount of time that I thought sufficient before washing it off again.

I'm half white and half black and although my hair has always been fairly short, it has an tough afro texture. I could be stood in the shower for an hour with water pouring on my head and the hair would remain sticking up. I'm not sure whether this was a factor or not but I could never style my hair in any way. So It wouldn't need combing when I got out of bed or out of the shower, it just stayed upright constantly and it still does.


For as long as I remembered every time I went to the barbers I would notice a huge about of what I thought was dry skin falling all over the black gown. I used to be so embarrassed about this and constantly tell the barbers that I had a dry scalp condition. I ever purchased special shampoo to treat dry scalp but nothing helped.


I couple of times a barber would tell me that I needed to clean my head properly. I just presumed that they didn't understand a dry scalp when they saw one. Before going to the barbers I would have long showers washing my hair for ages but nothing helped, 30 mins later I would be in the barbers chair with white flasked falling all over the place.


One time it was so bad that about five people in the barbers made comments about the amount of flakes scattered all about me during a cut. I was a little embarrassed but just told them all about my dry scalp condition. At the end of this particular cut I looked like I had been out in the snow for an hour.


So the realisation came one day when I was around 24/25 and I was washing my ears. Other than a five second rinse around with my fingers, I never really put much thought into cleaning the inside of my ears. I don't know why but on this occasion I decided to put shampoo inside my ears. I washed around for a while and after a few seconds I start to hear/feel my fingers squeaking, having washed away any oil that was there.


I suddenly thought of the phrase 'squeaky clean', and it all of a sudden dawned on me. Memories of my father hurting my head with his fingers came back to me. I had never heard or felt my head squeak in this way since I was a kid.


I quickly emptied a load of shampoo on my hair and instead of using my palms I dug in my fingers (hard) and started scrubbing. After a while on a certain spot I heard/felt a squeak.


OMG! Right there and then I quickly realised that I didn't have a dry scalp condition, I had just not properly cleaned my hair for all of these years. I washed the whole of my head until all of it squeaked.


I've made sure to clean to the squeak each time since. On the next trip to the barbers there was not a single white flake anywhere and there hasn't been one since.


I told the barber the doctor had given me some medication which has fixed my problem so that I didn't have to confess to being a dirty, dumb idiot. I will make sure my son never has to go though this by telling him my story.


TL/DR

For ten years I thought that I was covering the barbers gowns in white flakes because I had a dry scalp problem. It turned out that I just didn't know how to wash my hair properly.

"My [28F] boyfriend[29] intensely flirted with a ""good friend"" of his on instagram while we were on vacation together. We were planning on moving in together soon","We've been together for one year and prior to this happening, this was the happiest and healthiest relationship I've ever had. After having been in several long term relationships, he's the only one that I've ever truly wanted a future with. I'm also his first love. There was a lot I had to teach him about being a good partner, but I respected him, because when we had our issues, he listened and always showed me that he's willing to fix his side of things. I see him actually make changes to do so.

Now I have never looked into his phone before and had never felt the need to. However, a couple days ago while he was texting someone, I noticed one of his recently used emojis was a flirty one he's never used with me. I just had a nagging feeling someone wasn't right and I brought it up to him later when he was DMing a friend on instagram. When I asked to see his DMs, he got really defensive. I saw this girl's picture and asked who she was and apparently she was a ""good friend"" from his home state. I told him to show me their convo and he got extremely nervous and refused to let me see. After threatening to leave him, he finally showed me. It was a very flirtatious convo which started with her responding to his instagram story of a picture he took during our vacation. He complimented her, saying she's hotter than he remembers and ""thicc"", told her to come visit him during thanksgiving weekend (she lives in another state) repeatedly telling her that he really wanted to see her and take her around our city. She was reciprocative with the flirting but didn't seem to take him asking her to come too seriously. He responded with ""a man can only hope"". Convo stopped and then a couple of days later she messaged him again but there was no flirting and nothing brought up about their previous convo. 

After reading all this, I started packing up my things and broke up with him, I was shaking from anger. He started hysterically crying and begging me not to leave him, that this meant nothing, and he didn't know why he did it. I know he didn't physically cheat on me, but this hurts just the same. If he loved me as much as he claims he does, why would he have done it? We were in a great place, we were always so loving towards each other and supportive. 

He's been a mess since this happened and has been crying so much and hates himself for hurting me. He apologized so many times but has given me no excuses as to why he did it, that ""it just happened"". He even says he's not attracted to her and there were no intentions behind his words to her. He since messaged her with an apology for the flirting, that he shouldn't have done it and that they shouldn't talk anymore. He promises he will never betray me like that again and honestly my instinct believes him. But at the same time, I don't know how I should trust him again? Can I please get some advice on what to do and maybe help me understand why he could have done this?",relationship_advice

TIFU by finding out my dad is dating a milf I took home from a bar over a year ago and slept with multiple times.,"Hey reddit,

Throwaway because I really don't want this on my main and it getting linked back to me. TL:DR at the bottom.

Obligatory the TIFU technically happened over a year ago but it hit me today at lunch.

Okay so I'll start off by saying my mother and father divorced 5 and a half years ago, my mom has remarried but my dad has been very hit and miss with his luck dating. When he first started dating women I'd always get introduced to them early and then they would disappear off the face of the earth so I asked my dad to not introduce me to anyone until they are serious and have been together for at least 3 or 4 months. 

A bit of back story so y'all can see where this is going. Last July to be exact me and some buddies were out at a bar and being young competitive men saw some older ladies out at the bar (mid 40's) and had a bit of a joke around that none of us would be able to take any of them home. Well about 10 drinks and a few hours later our little laugh turned into a serious competition. We went over introduced ourselves, had small talk about what they are doing out, were a bit flirty etc and hit them up for a bit of a dance. I got talking to an absolutely fit, stunning dark haired lady who I'll call Susan. We were flirting, having a dance and a good time, I got her some drinks and could tell she was having a great time. Anyway as the night progressed I thought I'd shoot my shot and see if I could take a milf home, I found out that she had 2 kinds, one who was only a year younger than me. Here I am, fulfilling one of my biggest fantasies. So I get a Uber for us and she comes back to my apartment. We had really good sex and I got her number the next day after I drove her back to her car. We hooked up 2 more times before I met my current girlfriend.

Well a couple of weeks ago my dad calls me and tells me he wants me to meet this woman he has been dating for 5 months. He'd told me a bit about her, including that her name was Susan but we live in a pretty big city and I never thought anything of it. SOMEHOW OF EVERYTHING HE TOLD ME NOTHING REGISTERED IN MY BRAIN. He had said she had 2 kids a similar age to me, and most importantly that they had really hit things off and he really enjoyed her company and wasn't feeling lonely for the first time in years. Anyway he asked me to come for lunch today to meet her and was really excited. 

I got to lunch around 15 minutes early and was waiting for my dad and the new lady he's dating to show up, and low and behold I see my dad pull up out the front of the cafe we are having lunch at and see him and the new lady get out of the car. At this point I did the biggest double take of my life, surely it couldn't be...

BUT IT WAS, my dad, for 4-5 months has been dating the milf I took home from a bar over a year ago. I nearly had a panic attack. As soon as they walked in my dad pointed at the table that I was sitting at and I saw Susan's face screw up. She was walking behind my dad and just pulled a face that said ""don't you dare say anything right now"". 

So I sat through the most awkward 45 minute lunch of my life, sweating profusely with my dad asking me if I was alright because I looked sick. I can't even remember what we talked about at lunch because the whole time I realised that me and my dad are tunnel buddies now and I honestly am at a loss for what will even happen next. I want to talk my dad but I can't even imagine the conversation at this stage. I'm hoping Susan breaks things off and it doesn't go any further. How the fuck does this even happen, it's like the plot to a bad porn movie!!!

TL:DR - my dad is dating a lady who I have slept with before, she is mid 40's and my dad is early 50's and I can tell he is head over heels for her. Just so y'all know I'm 24.

TIFU update - so this has blown up and I decided to tell a couple of my buddies to ask what to do. I'll be catching up with dad with some beers to tell him because if the situation was reversed I'd want to know. Will update after I've told him.",tifu
My (21) little sister (12) was just given 1-3 weeks to live. What can I do to make her enjoy her last days?,"My sister was diagnosed about 2 1/2 years ago with T-Cell Leukemia. She struggled through it, with the chemo, radiation and infections, and lately we thought she was about to overcome it. But a few months ago it started spreading again and now the doctors are telling us we need to bring her home. 

There's nothing else we can do and I've never felt pain like this before. I know I need to be strong for her, but I just wanted to know what I can do to make her happy before she passes? Any ideas are appreciated.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and responses, I've been trying to read them all and respond to you all. 

We told her today about her situation: she cried a bit but told us that she was tired and she knew her time was coming. She will be given small doses of morphine to keep the pain away, have a hospice nurse and be able to pass away at home. I plan to make sure she's up for whatever I think we could do,  but unfortunately big trips or doing big things are out of the question. She's very tired and she seems to want to relax. I also want to say that I am for sure going to be recording audio, videos and taking SO MANY selfies with her before she passes. Some she'll know about and some she wont. I also plan on asking her to either draw me a tattoo or pick one for me, putting the recording of her saying she loves me and her name too. I'll let her pick the area, and see what she'd like to do. 

I have taken a leave of absence at my work and will be with her until her time comes. I will also be talking to my family about counseling and counseling for my little sibling as well ( my brother 10). 

I have read so many kind comments and I appreciate all of the support her, I and my family have received. I'm ignoring any negativity and want to be able to be as strong for her as possible.

"I [M61] just found out my wife [F51] ran up debt on 6 credit cards that totals 103,000 dollars.","UPDATE: a little long but this is where we are now

I want to thank all those that responded, it was a tremendous help. I wrote my post last night, couldn't sleep and didn't have any direction to proceed. Based on your feedback, all of her credit cards have been cut up. She has committed to paying the debt off, and has established some favorable job interviews on Monday, one related to teaching, another as sexual assault nurse examiner. After going through the finances again the total debt is 112,000. The interest is 19 to 20%, and she was only paying the minimum and not paying much on the principal. I have contacted my financial advisor and will meet with him on Tuesday, he understands the issue and we will pick the right option for consolidating the debt. She is losing authorization to our bank account and all of her spending will go through me. She is not on drugs or gambling, the money was spent mostly on clothes. After our son was born, she was a stay at home mom until he went to 1st grade. During this timeframe is when she started the spending. Her weight was up and she had very little to do, and her self esteem was low and she got credit cards in her name (only) and started buying. She thought she would pay debt off after getting a job, but the whole situation spiral out of control. I was traveling a lot for work and she was handling the finances. This was hidden until I discovered it last night. I feel we can recover financially but depends mostly on her. I was criticized for making her tell her parents what she did. We are in a small town in the deep south and family is important. My parents are not alive, and I needed her parents for support and getting her on the right path. She is an addict, and although this shamed her, she has to hit rock bottom and understand the damage she did to our family. This is the only way to recover. I met with her mother today and requested help in building her back up and not let her fall in depression or self pity. We are scheduled for couple counseling this Monday and hopefully we can start repairing trust in our relationship. Any additional input is greatly appreciated, but that's for all the input.



First time posting, need help on what I should do.  I [M61) just found out my wife [F51] ran up debt on 6 credit cards that totals 103,000 dollars. I have just retired after 35 years of working as an Engineer and was unaware she was spending money out of control. Since retiring, I'm more involved with the budget and found these unexplained charges in our bank account. When confronted she only told me of 3 of the six that were lower debt totaling 20,000. I dug further into our finances and made her show me her accounts with monthly charges and found more, the total was 103,000. She broke down completely crying and begging me to forgive her. She is an RN but hasn't worked for about 6 years. We have one son that recently graduated from high school, now attending 1st year of college. She was extremely involved with his school activities and functions, volunteering many hours, appearing as the perfect mom to the community. Still don't know what she bought with all the money, but believe it was buying clothing and other junk for her and my son, but mostly her, over a 10 year period. I made about 160,000/year so don't understand how she spent the income and generated this extreme debt. My current retirement income cannot cover these credit debts and I'm not willing to tap into my son's college fund or 401k fund. She has committed to finding a job and paying off all the debt by herself, but I feel I have been completely betrayed and have loss my trust in her. I told her this is a game breaker for our marriage and now wondering if I should be seeing a lawyer. She says she loves me extremely and beg me not to leave and that she will fix this mistake herself and it's her problem not mine. I feel she means it, but might be more concerned about finding out. Based on her personality she would be extremely embarrassed if people found out what she did. I made her call her parents and tell them what's she had done. She respects them tremendously and has always been seen as the perfect mother that did no wrong. I still love her, and both of us, love our son and don't want to split up. Need help on what to do any insights or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

My (22M) gf(26f) of 5 years killed my pet snake (14 yo) as soon we moved in together,"UPDATE ON THE BOTTOM

UPDATE #2 ON THE BOTTOM

UPDATE #3 ON THE BOTTOM

So I'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that I had since I was kid. 

She always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

But to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. He has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. Even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

When we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but I couldnt cuz I really love my snake.

Well now I came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

When I confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

I find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and I doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

I dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

I wanna confront her about it but I dont wanna seem like Im being petty

EDIT: When I brought up the snake missing she just started crying and saying I always do this?? Idek what she even means by this



UPDATE: she dmd me this (im out rn)

UPDATE 2: I went to the lake to search with my friend i was chilling with, couldn't find the snake, and talk to the gf. Were currently on break but were in the same house... not sure how thats gonna pan out

UPDATE 3: Didnt sleep all night, went to the lake (15 minute drive), and I found the snake but unfortunatly it looks like it got attacked by another animal as it has huge marks on him and looks impaled. Well with the gf, I am going to break up with her and go no contact but right now I have to find a way to get my name off lease papers and other documents too

Okay. I'm the type of person who will not let someone get away with shit like this. So I waited until she pulls up and as soon as she tries to order, I honk. She then looks at me with a dirty look and gives me the finger which I already had a middle finger of my own ready for her.

TIFU by almost having a gay threesome with my cousin and his husband," 

Didn't happen today, on mobile, throwaway account etc.

My job requires me to travel a lot between the USA and Canada - I have a 50/50 client split between the two places, so although I am based in Los Angeles, I fly into Toronto every few weeks.

All of my family and friends are also in LA, and I'm from a very conservative background, so when I realized at about age 12 that the thought of both girls and boys made me want to fiddle with my diddle, I kept the latter quiet to avoid being disowned by my father or giving my mom a heart attack. I've had plenty of girlfriends before and they're happy, I'm happy and there's no need to change that. Anyway.

I headed out to Toronto last Friday morning for a few meetings. Every now and then, I'll have meetings Friday and Monday, so I'll stay the weekend and have a little bit of a holiday in a nice hotel somewhere.

At about 4pm on Friday, I had finished my work, checked into my hotel and was feeling a bit horny. Anyone in the bi community will know it's easier to pickup guys then girls, so I downloaded Grindr, created an account, uploaded a few pictures (without my face - half because I'm ugly and half because I don't want to be recognized) and did some browsing. Some 20ish minutes in - I got a message. This guy was about my age, didn't have a picture, but gave me a description of himself and he sounded like a good way to spend my Friday night.

We start to make a plan for 7pm and he mentions he's married and asks if I'd be interested in his husband coming along and having a little threesome action. Now a threesome wasn't on my to-do list, but I'll give anything a go once so I said what the hell.

Anyways, it comes around to 6:30pm and I get a call. I have two SIM cards in my phone (one from Canada and one from the USA). It's my cousin who lives in Canada. I only speak to this guy probably 2-3 times a year, so it's a little weird, but not any cause for concern or anything and I was a bit busy at the time with some prep, so I let it go to VM. 60 seconds later, a txt. From my cousin:

&#x200B;

*""Hi it's xxxxx from Grindr. We're 2 minutes away, OK if we're a bit early?""*

&#x200B;

It took me about 30 seconds, but it clicks. Canada. Gay Married Cousin. The Description Matches. Holy fucking shit, I just organised a threesome with my cousin.

I sat there in the bathroom, trying not to have a panic attack for a few minutes until my phone rings again. Now obviously I'm not going to answer it, and I'm just praising god that I gave him my Canadian number over Grindr that he didn't have, and that I had him saved in my phone. The room phone begins to ring as well. Holy shit.

I swear to god, I have never put on clothes so fast and bolted down 30 floors of stairs so fast. At the bottom of the staircase, I was straight through that fire door and hid in the nearest McDonalds for the next 4 hours. 14 missed calls (10 from my cousin, 4 from hotel reception) and I took the SIM card out of my phone and snapped it in half. Found a new hotel room that night just in case. Have to come up with an excuse for work and my clients as to why I need a new Canadian number, but I think it was better than the other option...

**TL;DR Went to Canada for work, wanted a quick hookup, didn't do my due diligence and almost ended up having a threesome with my gay cousin and his husband, ran away and hid in a McDonalds for 4 hours**",tifu

Update - City police called my wife saying a store reported her for mis-scanning at a self check out to steal things.,"Well, I guess this was my welcome to the legal world. It's cheaper for my wife to plead ""No contest"". It doesn't matter whether she is guilty or not. They accused her of a crime, and because we can't afford to fight it my wife is going to be on probation. The fact that she could just be accused and suddenly we have to start spending without seeing a bit of evidence. 

Our options were pay $290 fine plus $50 for probation, or pay $500 for a lawyer just to help with pre-trial stuff.

America, where it's cheaper to be guilty, even if you aren't. At least she won't have a misdemeanor on her record.


She won't have a record because she was never arrested and the deferred adjudication means she won't have a record as long as she doesn't get a citation for a short time frame. I know there are steps after that. Non-disclosure applications and such. ",legaladvice

I figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. This all happened a few days ago. 

The day I made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. Well, that didn't turn out well. 

Before I told her about my background, I asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards Jews. She pretty much sounded like Hans Landa the whole time. At one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a Jewish student. 

Afterwards I bluntly told her that I'm Jewish. She didn't believe me at all and thought I was joking. I told her that I was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. This went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

When it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. Things went 0-100 very fast. She got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. She said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. When she insulted me I reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. She cried hysterically and I left. 

The next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that SHE dumped me and not the other way around.  She warned me not tell people that I dumped her since that would make her look bad. I didn't say anything and closed the door. I heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare I close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". After a while she left and started writing me on Snapchat. I blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. I've never seen her act so crazy. 

Long story short, I blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. I knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but I didn't know it would be this bad. Some of her stuff is still at my place. Oh well

AITA for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?,"Just as a little background, I grew up in a very strict Christian family where I wasn't allowed to cut my hair, ever, because ""hair is a woman's crown"". It was down to my knees by the time I escaped at 18. Ever since then I've either had a pixie, a buzz cut or have been totally bald, because I cannot stand the heavy feeling of long hair or all the brushing/washing/detangling after dealing with it for so many years. So that's a big reason I'm so stubborn about this issue. Also, all of my friends involved in this story have always known me as the girl with no hair. Right now I'm bald because I always shave my head completely for the summer. 

One of my good friends is getting married in August and she chose me to be one of her bridesmaids. Everything had been cool, she's always been the sweetest person and she showed no signs of going Bridezilla before this, until she called me up about three weeks ago and asked me if I could do her a favor and wear a wig to her wedding. She explained that she wanted all of her bridesmaids to match and that she wanted us all to look good in the pictures. I told her I really didn't want to get a wig, and we've been on bad terms ever since.

All of our friends are on her side because ""it's just a wig"" and ""it's not like she's asking you to grow out your hair for the wedding, so she's not the one being unreasonable."" And I know I can be very stubborn sometimes, which I guess is the reason I'm posting here. 

The thing is, I don't know how many of you will be aware of this but a wig that will actually look good/realistic is expensive. I've already paid for a bridesmaid's dress, new shoes, and plane tickets, as well as a small deposit for the person who's going to do our makeup. This wedding has already cost me a fortune. I could afford a wig if I wanted to, but do I really want to spend the money on something I'll never wear again when I've already spent a ton? Not really.

Also, this is going to be on a plantation in Louisiana. In August. I'm already going to be hot and uncomfortable, and a wig will make things a thousand times worse. 

My biggest reason-and this is why my friends are saying I'm the asshole-is the principle of the thing. I feel like it implies I look bad because I don't have hair, which I personally don't think is true. Is being bald so hideous I'll ruin her pictures? Is she going to make her balding father wear a toupee? And I think the ""I want us to match"" thing is stupid. We're already wearing matching dresses, why isn't that enough? I know it's ""her day"" and we're supposed to make her happy, but isn't there a line? 

I've offered to wear a cute headscarf as a compromise if my bald head is that offensive, but she's not having it. I'm still in the bridal party and invited but I don't know for how much longer, honestly. AITA for not wanting to wear a wig?

EDIT: Just to add two things: 1. She's not willing to pay or reimburse me for the wig, in part or in full 2. Along with the headscarf I'd also be willing to grow my hair out into a pixie cut, the wedding is at the beginning of August so it'd still be really short though.",AmItheAsshole
"Wife (38F) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. It's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks I am going to abandon her and ""our twins""","This is all over the place. I really need help.

My wife and I (M42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

All this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. After some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

We were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. Ofcourse I was super happy . 

A week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. The test came back negative and ofcourse I was devastated but she wasn't. She claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. We took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. My wife is in complete denial. Now she claims we are having twins. She is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

I am at a loss and don't know what to do. My inaction is making her believe that I want to leave them and that I am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

What the f is even happening. I love her but I don't know what to do.

Edit : forgott to add. I have tried talking her into therapy but she accuses me of gaslighting her

I (27F) am being asked to use my personal computer and download a tracker for work,"Hello,

As the post says I am a 27 year old family nurse practitioner in **Virginia**. I work in private practice, think family doctor, and my company from the beginning has required me to use my own personal computer. When I was hired I wasn't told about that, but instead on the first day, they told me to bring it and use it daily as it needs to go in with me to see the patients. I think this is crazy for a variety of reasons- lots of wear/ tear that I'm not compensated with, bring back/ forth- risk of losing it or it being stolen, patient's records on my personal computer, sick people getting germs on my computer and on and on. I have been at this position for 5 months and so far the mouse pad has stopped working because my hands are always wet with hand sanitizer. So then I had to buy a wireless mouse. I have a nice computer and I hate that it's being ""destroyed"" like this.

&#x200B;

Today I have strep. Strep as an adult is terrible. I told my boss I could either stay home or stay home and work at home clearing lab results, ect. That night on the phone she said yes please work from home. First thing this morning they wanted me to install a timer to my personal computer that allows the practice to see how much time is being spent in each chart, for billing purposes they say. It is a google chrome timer extension. I told them that I would be more than happy to use that on a work computer (we have a few desktops) but I was not comfortable downloading a timer on my home computer. She said OK, but was clearly mad, then 5 minutes later had her assistant call me and tell me to stop working for the day since I wouldn't install the timer and that I was now only allowed to use a desktop at work.

&#x200B;

This is on top of the fact that I have to clock in/ clock out on an app on my phone that tracks my gps. Yes, I have a master's degree and have to clock in/out even for lunch. During the entire time it is on, gps is tracked.

&#x200B;

So listen, I know I need a new job but- is this legal? How do I approach this? I am now going to have to use sick/vacation time that I wasn't planning on using. I think I should be paid for my time today.

TIFU by fucking my bf into a seizure,"I'm going to preface this TIFU by saying, no, this didn't actually happen today. It has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.

It was our first Valentine's Day together this year. I woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.

I decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. It was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. 

I needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...

This is when things begin to go wrong.

All of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. I glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (He has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)


Sure enough, he began to violently seize. I go full protective mode and try to help him. He was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.

We're both still naked and I have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. 

Fight or flight kicks in and I know I must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. I'm on the smaller side, being 5'6 and around 125lbs. So when my actively seizing bf (6'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, I go balls to the walls.

I grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting

*CLACK*


Once he's back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it's dislocated. I drive him to the hospital
And sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. I apologized profusely to my man, who responded

""Babe you fucked me into a seizure..I'm pretty sure you cannot top something like that.""
So not only, on our FIRST Valentine's Day together did I literally fuck him into a seizure, but I also dislocated his shoulder. 

TLDR: Had sex with boyfriend that had a seizure afterwards, tried to turn him on his side and dislocated his shoulder in the processs.",tifu
"LPT: After college, once you get the first job, start looking for a better job after a year or two. Don't stay out of loyalty.","Because trust me, no company is loyal to their employees. Be respectful and professional, but loyalty in a company is rarely noticed and appreciated - unless maybe if its your dad's company.


As a person who has worked for a same company for 6 years after graduating, i found out i didn't get a single raise within it unless i ask for it every fucking year, never got much other benefit than initially signed while studying at school.


So i started applying for 5 months and finally got a job, it pays me almost 5 (edit: 4 is more accurate+ benefits such as health care, lunch, gym etc...) times as much as i used to. My friend from same school, with same seniority was getting 4 times my salary for the last 2 years already.


My mistake was thinking that being loyal to this company was gonna in return make the company loyal to me, the company only wants lower costs, loyalty has no place here.


Edit: wow, didn't expect this response, also apparently this is very common in IT sector (but applies to pretty much all industry), and i am in the IT sector :/ - still feels so unfair.


Edit 2 : as some pointed out, try not to be a ""job hopper"", this depends heavily on the industry you are working in though.


Edit 3: this is not a golden a rule, use your own brain, only you know your situation best - just don't let loyalty for a company ever be the biggest priority, your career should be your priority.",LifeProTips

Purchased a laptop from a guy on craigslist and found CP on it. I am being told that calling the police is a bad idea because I am the one in posession of it.,"Basically the title. Bought the laptop from the dude at his home in his drive way. After 2 hours I found the CP on it and shut it down immediately. I wanted to call the police but I am being told that that is a terrible idea as the Texas law regarding it is stupid as fuck. They said that I would be the one charged as I am the one in possession of it and that the creator of it would face separate charges. 

Am I going to have to get an attorney for this or is there a way I can report this without one? I am pretty broke and can not afford even 100s for a consultation fee. 

Is my friend right in that I would be fucked if I called the police?

EDIT: I just got back from the police. I am not going to provide many details here other than I am not in trouble, so far, and that I only gave information about how long I had the laptop, how long it was before I found the CP, and handed over copies of all documentation. I had my old cell phone on me and recorded the audio of what happened on it for CYA. 

I was tempted to just wipe the device when I first found it as I felt like I did not want to lose the 200 I paid for it. Yes selfish I know but at that point I did not care. My conscience got the better of me though. The police have it now and I have records of everything in case they decide to bust down my door over this. ",legaladvice
AITA for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after I got rich?,"My mom left my dad when I was 17 (I'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. We all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. She had 2 more kids with this guy. 

When my mom and dad broke up I moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. The major reason for this was because she told me to leave as I kept fighting with her new dude. I really did NOT want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and I was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. When she told me to leave...Something in me changed and I am still unable to forgive her. That solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. And my sister and mom were CLOSE so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

Since I was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc I like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. They gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, I majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. The profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, I'm living a life I never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

I moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. I am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and I'm grateful so much bc I was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

For the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. She is getting increasingly more insistent that I go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. She keeps telling me that 'even if I don't forgive her I should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

AITA because day to day I have no interest in helping her or her family? IMO she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. I just can't forgive her though.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?,"I moved from Georgia to the Pacific Northwest last year for a dream job after I graduated college. It was a little bit of a culture shock, because I went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. There hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. For example, every white woman I meet mentions Beyonce to me within the first five minutes. When I was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'So... Beyonce.'

So the problem in the post title is that I am the only black woman at my office, and I am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and I'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. My name is Tina, short for Christina. Pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. For some reason, a handful of people at work call me Tiana, Tiara, or Tia, I think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. I am most often called Tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which I think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. The other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position I'm in) used to work there and I get called her name (Mary) sometimes too. Sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""How do you pronounce that?"" It's Tina!

I have tried politely correcting this and I correct it immediately every time. From polite, ""Just for the record, my name is Tina!"" to lighthearted, ""Tina, like Tina Belcher!"" In e-mails from me that say Tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, I still get, ""Thanks Tiana!"" Sooo... I'm considering doing the Twitter approach, where I just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. Like:

Chuck: Thanks, Tiana

Tina: No problem, Chad!

Jessica: Hi Tiara!

Tina: Good morning, Jennifer!

Would I be the asshole if I did this? I know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and I feel really disrespected by this, so I may as well have some fun with it.

EDIT: I am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so I just want to add a couple of things:

A lot of people have suggested that I gently and firmly remind people of my name. That's what I've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

A lot of people have suggested I go to HR. This is the kind of nebulous thing HR doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

A lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. It is. I have been black for 25 years, and I have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and I can identify it in my own life. It isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. I feel like a few people are ALMOST getting it. A lot of people are referencing that Key and Peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

And finally, a few people have asked why I don't use Tina Turner as an example, since she's also a black Tina. First, I thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with Tina Belcher, but I used 'Tina Turner' as an example for our Dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me Tina Turner, which took deprogramming from his EA to get over.

EDIT #2:

No, I don't have a southern accent. I'm from Atlanta, and black people from Atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. Plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. More to the point, no accent makes the name 'Tina' sound like 'Tiana' or ""Tiara""

No, the people I work with aren't just 'idiots.' As annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

No, I can't wear a 'Hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. We have a business professional dress code!

Yes, I correct them every time.

No, it's not because I'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

Responding to this post saying, 'Okay Shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('Tiana' being the 'Shaniqua' in this instance). Several people have alarmingly said, 'Okay, Trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'Chad' is VERY WEIRD!",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by making a cash register boy blush,"Short but sweet, obligatory TL;DR at the bottom.

I (F 34) was on my way back home from work, passing by the local grocery store and supermarket, located very close to my home.There are normally lots of stray cats in the neighborhood, but there is one in particular that always comes running when she sees me, so even when I am loaded with shopping bags, I can't help myself petting her.Today was no exception. I made sure to pet her only with the left hand, because I knew I wouldn't be able to wash my hands immediately (love her but she is kinda dingy), so to avoid touching my face or hair (as I often do), I was trying to do everything with my right hand.

So I go to the supermarket next, already on the cash register, unloading my basket and chit-chatting with the boy who works it (he looks to be in his early 20's, kinda cute), like I normally do.While I'm helping him arrange all items in my bag, I followed his gaze and noticed the questioning look he gave my left hand, as it must have appeared quite weird that I wouldn't use it, and instead hold it aside, like a surgeon ready to operate.Me being the kind of person who feels the need to explain any misunderstandings away (because God forbid somebody thinks something weird about me, lol) chirp up casually:-Oh, I just stroke a kitty with that hand, so I try not to touch anything else before I wash my hands properly.Mind you, I said that in my native language, where the word for kitty and the euphemism are interchangeable, like *p.u.s.s.y* in English.

He stopped scanning the groceries for a moment and when I looked at him, he had this priceless expression on his face.... Eyes a little wide, sort of flushed, looking at me in disbelief.Only then did it hit me what I said and how it must have sounded to him.I quickly corrected myself, elaborating saying:-Kitty. Cat, you know. A stray. Meow meow. (Yes, I really said that....\*cringe\*)

He made an ""Oooooh..."" sound and bit his lips suppressing a burst of laughter.

I think I might shop elsewhere in the next few days... \*facepalm\*

TL;DR: I accidentally woke somebody's dirty mind by making him think I've pet my kitty...

Husband's Co-Worker,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years and together for 16. We are high school sweethearts. We just had our first child in August this year. I am 32 and he is 34. 

My husband works full time as a pharmacist, and I work at the power board. We have a great relationship, and rarely argue. He is my best friend. 

He took a position at a 24 hour Pharmacy as a staff pharmacist to train for a management position in 2015. This is one of the busiest pharmacies in our area. There are 15 technicians and 5 pharmacists including him at this location. They hired a new tech there that I will call Jane. She is 24 and married with 3 kids. I think she may have gotten pregnant with her third child after working there. Anyway she was a hard worker and my husband got along just fine with her and everyone there. 

However, she started texting him about work related things when he wasn't at work and started calling him Bossman. I was annoyed by her calling him that but I let it go. 

When I would go visit my husband at his work, she was always always overly complimentary to me. Telling me I was the cutest pregnant person ever, etc. I didn't think much of that as that is not my personality type but each to their own. She added me as a friend on Facebook and I accepted. I am friends with multiple coworkers of my husband both male and female. 

She began telling my husband about her marital problems. That she thought her husband was cheating on her, etc. She also wanted him to pick her up and take her to work when the weather was bad, she had car trouble, and other reasons. Now the current pharmacy manager does all this, so my husband didn't see an issue with it. So he picked her up a few times when the weather was bad. 

Fast forward to May of this year, my husband gets promoted to pharmacy manager and Jane wants to transfer to his store. She picks up all the extra shifts there. I'm still pregnant with my daughter and this point, and so I go see him one night. She straight up avoids me. I try to speak to her to be nice and she ignores me. So I ask my husband, he shrugs and says he don't know. 

The texts start increasing and it's more non work related stuff than work related stuff. She starts tagging him in things on Facebook and I am uncomfortable with it. So I tell him to put a stop to it. The final straw is she asks my husband to pick her up at a car dealership and take her to work since her car is being serviced. Keep in mind that her husband works at the dealership where her car is being serviced and they have a vehicle each. That's when I lost it and put my foot down. 

Well she no longer wanted to transfer to his pharmacy after he told her the texts and asking for rides had to stop. She basically went silent. I was still fuming and friends with her on Facebook so I posted a meme and she deleted me. She did not block me just deleted me. 

She told everyone at work that I didn't like her and she just didn't understand why and she wasn't transferring to his store anymore because my husband didn't like her. 

My husband had to go back to the store she works at to take care of something and he didn't speak to her, she went to a coworker and was on the verge of tears because my husband didn't speak to her. 

So anyway she gets a new job at the hospital and leaves the pharmacy. I'm so glad to be done with her and the fact my husband will never see her again until she tells another coworker at that Walgreens who I am very good friends with that she is coming back on 1/10/19 because she doesn't make enough money at the hospital and has filed for divorce from her husband. I'm not too upset by this. He rarely ever has to go to that store and will never see her. 

Well on Friday we got news he is going to be promoted to manager of that store and his first day there will be around the time that Jane starts back working there. I trust my husband completely but I just don't know how to handle this situation.  They will be working together every day. 

Now I realize that a lot of this stuff happened while I was pregnant and hormonal but I just have a bad feeling about all of it. 

Any advice is appreciated, and I'm so sorry for the long read. ",relationship_advice

WIBTA if I don't attend my sister's $2800 per ticket destination wedding? *I do have enough money.,"My sister is having a Destination wedding in the Dominican Republic (all-inclusive).  It'll cost me $2800 dollars to attend (there's no option to adjust the dates/costs. it's for a full week).
My sister would be very upset if I don't attend.  My parents say I should go, and that I'm being selfish for saying I'm not going.  

My sister lives far away and we see eachother once a year due to cost/ busy schedules.   I don't make a ton of money, but I have enough money to attend the wedding and my parents and my sister know it.  While I really want to support her --and would attend a local/ more reasonabley priced destination wedding in a heartbeat-- $2800  just seems too much. And less importantly, I have zero desire to go to an all-inclusive resort as I don't drink or enjoy suntanning.

  In my defence, I've worked hard for my money and I sacrificed quite a lot to be where I am financially.  And while I have accumulated significant savings, it isn't because I earn a big salary. But, because I work long hours, and very rarely spend money on anything beyond the bare essentials.  The cost of this trip would exceed the value of my worldly possessions including my car.  It would also require me using a full week of what little time I get off work.

 I really don't know if I'm being selfish, cheap, and callous or if I'm being reasonable.   Last night I almost booked the ticket out of guilt, but, I couldn't do it and have since resolved not to go.  So what do you guys think?  AITA not wanting to attend?",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by letting my girlfriends dad use my laptop [NSFW],"so today I had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, I'm still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn't make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story I'm 27 and I live with my girlfriend, we've been together for 2 years now and through out that time I've seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they're usually travelling so it's a little harder to spend time with them. Now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and I for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. We've also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

So on top of making porn I'm also an aspiring film editor and I am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but I also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us I'd been editing a new video, usually after editing I go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because I'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. We were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, I immediately said sure and led him into the office, now I could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and I kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. So I lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as I opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst I ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

I panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

Her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and I are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but I hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and I'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



TL;DR I unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

UPDATE: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so I'll explain, as I said earlier in the post I watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep I just shut the laptop without even thinking, I do this often (I know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. Still haven't heard from her dad yet. I honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and I laugh a lot so thank you

UPDATE: AITA for refusing to give my newborn's social security number to my aunt.,"[Link to a snapshot of my OP](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bwoxwx/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_newborns_social/epz1kn2/)

I was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. My aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. I explained why exactly I didn't feel good about giving her Leyla's social security number. They both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

After explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. We ended up working out a compromise - My wife and I opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. Everything seemed to have worked out well.

Yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from Romania. She had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. She said it completely justified my hesitation. Her information was stolen in the Equifax breach a couple of years ago.

"TIFU by causing an explosion 40,000ft above the Atlantic Ocean on an international flight.","I was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from Delhi to London, so I quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as I ran to the boarding gate.

About 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the TVs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.

I can't even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. Immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. It didn't help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn't see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. The people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.

After a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. My travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. Tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.

As it turns out, in India they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don't get crushed. They're also dirt cheap, so I bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks I'd grabbed in a rush earlier). The pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. 

And **that** is how I accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.

"TIFU by poisoning my cat, Parsley","[This guy](https://i.imgur.com/uU57bdj.jpg)
Usually Parsley is a **huge dildo cat**, always wanting food and pats, biting if he doesn't get what he wants, sitting on my face, **big dick energy** without the balls.

This morning when I woke up later than usual he was not up in my grill wanting food, weird but okay. He's sleeping curled up on the couch, when I say good morning he looks at me like - __- and gets up. Tries to jump of the couch, stumbles, lands **face first.**

I laugh he gets up and he starts walking weird, not limping just uncoordinated. Usually he's **pretty vocal** too especially when he's hungry but he was **completely quiet**, his sister smacked him and he barely even **reacted**

Now I'm **freaking out**, thinking he has a **blood clot or a brain tumor** or something. I book him in for an urgent appointment at the vet in half an hour.

I keep an eye on him while we wait, at one point he tried to scratch his ear with his back leg and **missed several times.** When he tried to loaf he was sort of **wibbling wobbling.** He didn't seem interested in food until I started feeding his sister, Shenanigans, but luckily he ate so I was feeling a bit better.

**At this point I'm crying thinking the motherfucker is gonna die on me like a bitch.**

We take him to the vet, he goes into his carrier calmly without incedent which is very unusual. Vet tests his legs, stretching them out and rotating, nothing there. He often gets abscesses from fights but nothing like that. Vet checks his gums and teeth, his gums are a bit pale which is an **indication of onion toxicity which is fatal**. We'd had nachos the night before which has a bean mix with onions. I tell them he might have gotten some from the pan since we didn't clean it up straight away. If the onion toxicity is bad enough he might **need a blood transfusion to save his life.**

He's also slightly overweight and middle aged which makes him **at risk for diabetes** which can cause nerve damage when left untreated. 

He's kept at the hospital for the rest of the day for observation and blood tests. Vet gives me **brochures on possible household toxins** that are harmful to cats. I go home in tears thinking my cat might be **dying** and blaming myself for not cleaning up the **freaking nachos** last night.

I read some of the brochures to calm down. I go through them thinking maybe he got to some lilies in a neighbours backyard or he licked bleach out of toilet. Then there was **the last entry.**

**Marijuana. Oh fucking shit fuck.**

Motherfucker I'd made some **super strong cannabutter** last night in prep for a Patrick swayze move night this weekend. That pot had a cup of butter and **a quarter ounce of hydro, simmering for 3 hours**. Parsley also **loves butter** and the smell of weed doesn't put him off. 

Parsley has always been **terrified of stoves** though, from when he touched it while it was on so he doesn't go near them while they're lit. I'd strained and refrigerated the cannabutter quickly after making it but I'd left the dirty pot in the sink over night. I decide to check it and

**that bitch is suspiciously clean.**

Parsley isnt fucking **dying** he's just high as a **god damn kite.**

I have to call the vet and tell them my suspicions. His blood test came back negative for anything scary. He'd had **6 serves of chicken** while at the vet and **napped** almost all day, played with some dogs and snuggled with some kittens. Motherfucker had a **great time. **


**TLDR I made dank cannabutter, left out the dirty pot in the sink overnight, stupid cat licked it clean and had a real good time on my dime. I should charge him for it. **

Edit 1: boy, this bold keyword thing is very contentious huh

Edit 2: can now confirm after making caramels that the cannabutter is strong

Edit 3: there were some people worried that I would be letting Parsley eat his fill in the future. I assure you I will not, I did say it was a fuck up after all

"[UPDATE] [PA] I followed and reported a drunk driver, then I got a ticket for driving past curfew","This is an update to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

I took the advice that I was given and I pled not guilty. Last week I went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200B;

I brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that I called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. I also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and I printed out a copy of the [""justification"" law](https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/LI/consCheck.cfm?txtType=HTM&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

The hearing started with the officer saying that I was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why I was there, and that I voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. He said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

Then it was my turn to speak. I said that while I did drive past curfew, it was because I had noticed an erratic driver and I was following him because I thought he was going to hurt someone. I felt that if I had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. I gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and I said that I would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. I argued that I had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 BAC. (The judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the BAC.)

Finally, I brought up the justification defense. I argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. I said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because I drove in an otherwise safe manner.

The judge agreed and found me not guilty! He said that I had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that I had done the right thing. I'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Went to court. Police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" I presented my defense that I was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. Judge agreed; I was found not guilty!",legaladvice

[SC] RA keeps interrupting sex because I'm gay (update),"Hello again legal advice. This is a follow up to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9bfpx8/sc_ra_keeps_interrupting_sex_because_im_gay/

I've got good news: the RA has been removed! I went to the residence coordinator and he called someone above him in the housing department, who told us to write down every incident I remember for housing to review, then go to the title 9 coordinator. It took awhile to get through all the paperwork, but the process was a lot less intimidating than I thought it would be.

The RA was fired and given the option of either moving to an empty room in one of the old dorms or moving off campus within 30 days. He chose to move out and stay with his girlfriend after a week, which I didn't realize he had since I've seen other women come into his room but I don't feel like stirring that pot. After I made the report, he stopped banging on the door when my bf was over, but every time he saw me I could feel him staring daggers into me. He also started doing petty stuff like ""accidentally"" knocking my towel onto the floor of the shower room and leaving it there. He left me an apology letter at one point, but it was definitely not sincere. I could've moved to another dorm temporarily but decided it would be too much work because they gave him a 30 day deadline and he started packing the Tuesday after.

Yesterday the new RA finished moving in, and after talking to him about all that happened I think we're going to get along fine! :)

The residence coordinator said that housing had done all they could do, any further action would be done as a result of the title 9 complaint, which might take several months to complete.

I (f 28) walked in on my step son (8) touching my son (4),"I'm so stunned, it hasn't even sunk in.

It was early this morning. My husband was already gone for work, but I went to wake my step son up for school. He and my son slept in the same bed last night, sometimes when my son has nightmares he goes into his brother's room.

I walk in and they are awake, lying down and my stepson is just like playing with him. I can't bring myself to describe in detail. My son was giggling but as soon as he saw me, my step son burst into tears.

He got up and ran into my arms. He kept saying ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" I told him it's okay. I didn't know what else to say, I was speechless. He kept pleading with me ""please don't tell daddy"". 

He was so distraught so I didn't have him go to school. All day he's been in his room alone crying. My son is fine, he's been watching cartoons and playing with his toys all morning.

I don't want to tell my husband on the phone, I want to wait till he comes home. But I don't know what to say to him. I'm so worried, I don't think he'll take it well. How do I tell him? What can I do? I know it sounds crazy, but I'm not angry at my step son I'm just sad and confused. I want both my son and him to be okay.",relationship_advice
TIFU by letting my wife nair my butt,"The male community is pretty split on the forest vs clearing debate when it comes to bums. I happen to like a well manicured booty. Normally, I use a trimmer with no gaurd because it's fast and trying to manuver a razor back there is far too risky. I do this every couple of weeks or so.

The downside to this method is that it doesnt get super close and leaves a a little butt stubble. I was lamenting this fact to my wife when she lit up and offered up a genius solution. ""You should let me nair your butt."" Said she, with a gleam in her eyes. ""Its easier than a trimmer and it will make your butt super smooth.""

""Well, okay."" Says I.

Elated, she runs to grab the tube, sits down face level with my butt and goes to town with a little more fervor than you would expect for someone tasked with rubbing cream on a hairy man butt. Marriage is strange. A few minutes later, I wash it off in the shower and we gush over how baby-smooth things are down there. I mean a baby dolphin would be jealous of this thing. It was like silk and rubber got together for a night of sweet love and produced an offspring. I finally understood what that Santara song was about. All was good in the world. Or so I thought.

The next day I noticed some slight itchiness, but I figured it would pass, so I just tried to ignore it and focused on not scratching it as best as I could. Later that night, my wife and I got undressed and got in the shower together. We were having an unrelated conversation, when I remembered the itchiness I had been feeling throughout the day and told her about it. ""Well turn around so I can take a look."" So I turned around, stuck it out, and awaited her analysis.

...

Dead silence. 

I turned back around to find her with her hands over her mouth trying her hardest to hold in a laugh. I craned my neck and twisted my body to try to get a view myself, and I was met with a horrifying sight. Like a thief in the night, somone had stolen the silky smooth booty that was there just mere hours before and replaced it with one that was COVERED in huge, bright red bumps. Unable to contain it any longer, my wife busted out laughing, while I jumped out of the shower to inspect it closer in the mirror. Overnight, it had gone from glorious, shimmering dolphin fin to 14 year old getting slapped in the face by puberty.

My wife maintains the hypothesis that it was an alergic reaction to the hotel soap possibly somehow exacerbated by the nair, as I did get a few small bumps on other parts of my body, but nothing like the warzone that my backside now looks like.

I maintain that it was sabatoge because she was jealous and wanted to have the only smooth bum in the house.

Moral of the story: never challenge a woman's rightful status of smoothest booty. 

TL;DR: I let my wife nair my butt and now it looks like Freddy Kruger face fucked a topographical map of Utah.",tifu
[Update] Family left me (18M) when they thought I wasn't my dad's son but now they want to get back in touch,"starts here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/9ytrw0/family\_left\_me\_18m\_when\_they\_thought\_i\_wasnt\_my/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ytrw0/family_left_me_18m_when_they_thought_i_wasnt_my/)

&#x200B;

tldr: dad thought I wasnt his kid and left me. Now, it turns out I am his kid and he wants to be in my life again. But it's been four years and he was really shitty to me all this time, so I dont really want to be his pal. Family says I'll regret not giving him a chance, and I came to the internet for perspective.

&#x200B;

Thank you all for the advice, but I decided to go with my gradpa's (which was kind of the same most of you gave me) and I'll be standing my ground.

I've been really annoyed lately cause a lot of people around me keep saying I'm a crazy teen and I'll regret it. But grandpa made a point that I need to stop trying to decide how I'll feel in the future. Cause truth is you can never know. You have to make decisions now, based on feelings and info you have now. Not based on feelings and info you MIGHT have later.

Right now, I´m disgusted by dad and brother. I want nothing to do with them. I don't trust them. And I even think there is a chance they might be doing this (reaching out) just for optics and money.

If my feelings change, I will deal with that when they do. Cross the bridge when I get to it and all.

I wasn't really gonna post an update on this, cause I don't see the point. My story is kindda over.

But something happened yesterday and I wanted to share.

So I decided to stand by my ""fuck no, I don't wanna talk to them"". I'll be moving to another city soon and decided to change my number. Grandpa is the only one who will be having the new one, I asked him not to share and I know he wont. He is a retired cop, so he's really badass and has zero patience for bullshit, my new number is safe. He called my mom and told her that, from now on, if anyone wanted to reach me, they'd have to go through him.

So mom showed up at his place (I've been living with him for a while) and tries to talk to me, but grandpa says she has to talk to him first, so he can DECIDE whether she is allowed to talk to me or not. LOOOOL so mom goes INSANE, and starts telling him that it's none of his business and that this is between me and my dad, so grandpa goes something like ""if anybody shows up at my lawn to disturb the boy, I'll get the cops, a restraining order and a shotgun"". It goes on for a while until mom says I'm not the only family grandpa has, and that by doing this, grandpa is pushing everyone away and splitting the family, he has other grandchildren, why is he picking just the one, and so on... so grandpa fucking laughs and tell her that through no fault of his, this family blew up long ago, and everyone just grabbed a piece of what was left and ran for it. He looks at me and says I'm his piece, so he's not letting go and fuck it.

I was feeling like laughing up to this point cause mom was going crazy and all, but when he fucking said that, I broke. Mom left after a while and I just hugged my old man like life depended on it, and he just said something like ""enough now, no need for that, I'm your family, family doesn't leave. You remember that when you have one of your own"", and I fucking will.

&#x200B;

tldr: won't be pals with dad and brother. I'm good. Grandpa is the shit.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

edit - o, before I forget. Some people were asking about what my siblings were like. Well, my older brother stole/took shit that were mine or supposed to be mine, he lied to me and about me (and not the innocent kid lie, but fucked up shit that ruined relationships I had with friends, family, even a girlfriend I cared about). He was a huge bully for years, even hit me once. Mom said ""he's going through a lot to"" and dad couldn't care less and just protected him. Grandpa told him if he ever hit me again, he would break brother's teeth in. I guess he believed him, cause he never touched me after the one time.

younger brother is cool, I'd rather not talk about him here

&#x200B;

another edit - I read the comment section to grandpa, I had to explain what OG is and he now wants to watch Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul lol, but we thank you for all the love. Reading the replies on my first post he just said ""the internet is very smart"", reading the replies on this update he got a little emotional and left saying he had stuff to do. But he got a beer, came back and asked if ""there were more people saying stuff"". The comment comparing him to Clint Eastwood made his day! Thanks for the love guys",relationship_advice

"TIFU by sending my son to school in his pajamas because I had misread ""Pi Day"" as ""Pj Day"" in a school email.","Let's start off by saying I'm a single dad and my son is in kindergarten. His teacher sent out a message yesterday that said ""Tomorrow for Pi day we have a parent bringing in a snack."" I had only glanced at it. Ten minutes later, I got a message from my son's mom asking if I have a matching set of Pjs for him to wear. I replied yes, and then never looked at the teacher's email again.  

Fast forward to this morning, and I dress my boy in his favorite Pjs and take him to school. As I approach, I notice that no one else is wearing Pjs and my son is trotting around in bright red spider man pajama pants. So I get him to the door of the school, send him in, and immediately pull my phone out to look at the email. I had to read it twice before I noticed that it didn't say ""Pj Day"" at all, but fucking ""Pi Day!"" 

So I sent an email to his teacher explaining the mix up and asked her to make him feel comfortable today. She said she glossed it over with the other kids and made it a non issue. Luckily, they are only 5-year-olds in kindergarten with little self awareness. 

So sorry, son! Here's a little lesson on being different!!

TL;DR - Sent my son to school in his pajamas because I had misread ""Pi Day"" as ""Pj Day"" in a school email. His teacher made it a non issue in class and it didn't scar my son for life, hopefully. 



UPDATE: His mom picked him up and said that he immediately asked to call me to let me know that today was not pajama day.  He said that his teacher let him slide because he had enough classroom points, but he knows that it wasn't Pj day. Lol. His mom took part of the blame. Thank goodness he's so young. This would not have worked out as well in first or second grade. 

Edit: Wow! My first gold and silver. Thanks everyone!! I'm glad you enjoyed my story. 

Edit 2: Sorry for my choice of wording. But let me clarify that there wasn't any blame or consequence by the teacher.  I was self blaming, if anything. The teacher just used the classroom points as a hollow excuse to lighten any ridicule or confrontation from the other kids. I think she was just trying to bring it forward in a positive light and then get past it and move on. No blame or consequence. Just the teacher spreading sugar and me feeling like an ass. ",tifu
AITA for attacking a muslim's beliefs when she didn't want to sit next to my brother and his friend on the plane?,"Long time lurker, here is my first post!

So I (F16) was on a flight from Dubai to new York, so it was quite a long trip. Usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother's friend couldn't afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. Our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn't present during this whole situation.

When we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. I was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.

Then his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. I saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. 

I wasn't paying attention but I took off my headphones when I heard my brother's friend say no to the lady. She then said: ""It is against my religion to touch men in public"" and my brother said,

""But we're not touching you.""

She looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother's friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. I thought she was so entitled, so I told them,

""Don't move. Just ignore her.""

She then proceeded to ask me if I knew them, so I said yes. She asked to switch with me. So this is what I said,

""No. I don't want the middle seat because I'm very claustrophobic (I'm not, I just prefer the aisle seat so I can stretch my legs)"" and she said, 

""that's not my problem.""

That's when I got really pissed and I said it,

""Your religion is not our problem. Should've chosen better seats then"" 

Then she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that's the last we saw of her. I'm guessing they moved her to another empty seat. 

When we got back from the trip, my brother's friend told me he was going to move and I wasn't right to attack her religion like that.

So Reddit, AITA?

AITA for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?,"This is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

I live on an obscure little island near the UK. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that I appeared on a few years ago. 

The premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. Some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. I sailed through a lot of the physical part because I wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so I was ok there.

As for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

I thought of a believable lie before I entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and I put down all the things I'm *not* scared of. I listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. I literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. I grew up in rural landscape and I've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. My actual fear is a bit more obscure and I really honestly knew I'd fail if I was put in a room with it. 

When I entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* I was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross I can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

I did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. The rest of the contestants failed.

Now, I won a pretty average car which I didn't particularly want, so as soon as I legally could I sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

I told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think I cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

I'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?,"I (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. We met on instagram, I followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. I thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. She makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. 

However, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. Whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. She has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. 

Recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. As soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. 

This really annoyed me, I get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. If she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. She just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. I just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. 

Also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.

On the way home, I told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"". I told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks I'm an asshole. ",AmItheAsshole

If your child is fat it's your fault and you're a bad parent.,"Obviously there's a handful of medical conditions that are exceptions, but if your child is otherwise healthy, it's your fault. 

You are their caretaker, you control most of what they eat, and you control their physical activity to a great extent. 

If your child gets to the point where their weight starts to cause health problems you should be charged with child abuse and have your child taken away.

You're letting them learn eating habits that are going to cause them to likely be fat their entire life, putting them at a higher risk for a long list of serious health issues. 

Edit: I'm gonna try and address some reoccurring comments here. 

I understand that (at least in the States) a lot of the time it is cheaper to buy junk food, but this isn't a good argument because you can still lose weight with junkfood. For the overwhelming majority of people weight loss comes down to calories in being fewer than calories out. 


And on taking kids away from parents I agree there should be some steps before that happens. There should be serious health impacts before this happens, and some kind of intervention in the form of a diet/exercise plan given to the family to follow. But if you're gonna let your kid get diabetes at 16 then yea, they should be taken away.

TIFU by plagiarizing from my OWN Reddit post and getting threatened to be dropped from my University,"***Background***

I am a very passionate writer. I *had* an account that was just for writing prompts. Every week I would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  

***Story Time***

Last year, on r/WritingPrompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. I forget the full details, but it intrigued me and I wrote a 6-PAGE STORY about it. Anyways, that post didn't gain any traction (which sucked), but I still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that Reddit post.

**^((It was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**

***Present*** 

So a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. So I was like, okay sweet I don't need to spend any time on this project. I went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. To be sure I don't get into any trouble, I delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn't delete all my comments. 

Yesterday, I get an email from the Professor saying I need to meet with the Dean immediately. At this point, I am shitting my pants. She told me that I stole someone else's work and I could be withdrawn from my program. I try to explain but I have no proof that it was my work because I no longer live at home and I wrote it on an old laptop. I have a meeting with the head of the University later today. I am so fucking scared. I am currently driving home to find that fucker.  

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I copied and pasted my own work from my own Reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. Could be withdrawn from my program


Edit 1: [17:00] I found my original work. Took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. Travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. I'm okay with taking a zero, obviously, I just hope they can reason. 

Also, I can't show the Reddit emails because I never had a real email for the account. 

Edit 2: SUCCESS! I brought my old laptop to the University principal and provided proof that I was the one to write the story. They were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what I told them before. They asked me why I did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. I told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. 

*Results*

I am not kicked out, and I am actually given another chance at the project. My professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. 


Thanks everyone who supported me through this! I won't do this again. I'm sorry. 


Also, thanks u/SQUID_FUCKER for the suggestion

> Just read all the edits.  You know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  If the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.

Sending food to countries that can't feed themselves only makes the problem worse. The root of the problem is these people can't feed themselves. Feeding them only allows them to keep reproducing, creating even more mouths that can't be fed. Either teach these people to farm or let them starve. If they aren't capable of farming, survival of the fittest. 

Parts of Africa are like the crazy cat lady. She sees a few starving cats and thinks this is horrible, so she feeds them. Pretty soon they reproduce and she has even more cats to feed. What started out as a few starving cats turns into 50 starving cats. She hasn't solved a problem she just made it worse. She had good intentions but didn't stop cats from starving, she just created more starving cats.

I (21F) found a hidden camera in my house. I suspect my SIL (26F) put it there to watch me while I babysit my nephew (1M). What do I do?,"I babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm Mon-Fri for free because a) I love my brother and nephew and b) I'm already a SAHM for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, I have everything he needs already at home and I love kids. 

The spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. There is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv I found a weird circular object with a lens in it. After some googling I found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. I flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. He vehemently denied it and suggested I called the police and explain to them that I need a bug check. The only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my SIL; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and Bro and our parents only come on the weekends. I suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. Another reason I suspect SIL is because I had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" It could be a coincidence, but now that I found the camera I'm not so sure.


If it's her, she knows I know since I'm assuming she saw me find it. What do I do? Do I confront her and ask if its hers? I couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; I have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. I would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care I take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course I treat my nephew the same.",relationship_advice

AITA for telling my GF's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?,"Me and Diomara (12F) have had a rough summer.  She's been more defiant than usual.  I've been dating her Mom Mara (30F) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, Maple (33M).  Both Dio and Mara have an on again/off again relationship with Dio's Dad (Dynasis).  He's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into Dio's life.   Typical shitty-ass part time Dad.  I've tried to fill the Dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200B;

This summer Dynasis decides he wants to be a real Dad and takes Dio in for a month.  Good for him, not my business, and Mara agrees.  When Dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  Really mean to me, very dismissive.  A few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  Security took her in then called Mara, who didn't answer, then called Dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  I answered.  They told me I had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200B;

I didn't say anything to her while I picked her up.  I apologized to security, apologized to the store.  I even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  I assured them Dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200B;

I'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  NOT yelling, but in a fatherly tone, I suppose.  I'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how I dont fuck with thieves, and how I absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so I don't appreciate any of this nor will I accept it in my house.  She snaps back that I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  From now on, if I wanna tell her something I need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200B;

That killed my soul.  For the past year or so, I've treated her as my own daughter.  I've paid for their housing, I've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  Her bio Dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  The fuckin check bounced so I had to call him up and he brought cash over.  I told Mara about all of this.  She was appalled at what Dio said, but she never made Dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her Dad.""

&#x200B;

A couple of days later Dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  I say go ask your Dad.  She scoffs and says her Dad doesn't have the money for it, so I have to pay for it.  I tell her...I'm not her Dad so don't ever tell me what I have to pay for.  She cried to Mara, who tells me I'm not being an adult about the situation.  Mind you, I never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  Mara says Dio is a kid and I need to stop acting like a kid too.",AmItheAsshole

UPDATE: I'm [37/f] unexpectedly pregnant. My husband (35/m) wants an abortion and to keep it quiet. I'm not comfortable with this. What should I do?,"My original post was some time ago, so newcomers may not have seen it. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50axee/im_37f_unexpectedly_pregnant_my_husband_35m_wants/



I wanted to give you kind people an update that is well overdue. First though, I'd like to take a moment to thank you (most of you) for your support and kind words. For the most part the community came through with useful advice. I really needed help and felt extremely lonely during my original post. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. 


An now on to the update. I'm 39 now and my husband is 37. I was able to see a therapist a day or two after my original post and had a good cry while hashing out the whole story. I told the therapist about the advice I got here (she hadn't heard of reddit) and she agreed as well. I went through with the pregnancy. My husband had the option (obviously) to stay or leave. He decided to stay. 


Not only did he decide to stay, but he's the happiest he's ever been in his life. Reminder: we were a childless couple and did not plan on ever having kids. Our daughter has brought so much love into our hearts that we are both amazed. I see the world in a different way now that I have her. He loves our daughter with every bit of himself. Amazingly my love has grown for this man. He has told me that she has opened up parts of his heart that he never knew was there. I understand what he means. The happiness that I feel is beyond words. Both my husband and I are so thankful that we had our daughter. We talk about it every month or so and can't believe how much we would have missed out if we didn't have her. To top it all off, we have decided to have another baby! 


So thank you, reddit. Your support helped me through a difficult time. I hope that those of you that took the time to comment on the original post see this update. 


EDIT: Holy schmoly reddit. Pinned and gilded for the first time! Thank you for the gold, kind stranger. Thank you to all of the wonderful, positive messages. I have read and appreciate every one of them. I'm glad that sharing my story brought a smile to so many faces (or tears of joy in some cases!). ",relationship_advice

I wanted to thank everyone for your help. This isn't a super happy post, but i felt the need to update. 

A few days after i posted that, i got a call from her parents it turns out she took her own life, she left a written message for me and the kids in English that was basically consisted of her apologizing, and going in great lengths about how she didn't understand who she was anymore. But she thanked me and told me she loved me.

The funeral was held in Korea last week, i went with the kids. Her parents spent a lot of it apologizing to me over and over again about how they failed to see what was wrong with her, and how they blamed themselves. They also agreed to return all the money she removed from our joint accounts, and then some (apparently they did not approve of this). 

However this all aside, they were very cold to their grand-kids, and i got the impression they were doing this out of guilt or something and barely talked to them. Even then there is a big language barrier between us. My ex-wife's sister was much more supportive and happy to meet the kids and promised to come down sometime to visit them. 

I still have a huge amount of stuff to mentally unpack, and figure out however i am not panicking for money right now. I don't really know how to feel about this at all.

[Update] From the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on Christmas,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  My girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think I'm a loser. Even though we're an otherwise great couple, I'm thinking about breaking up because I don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and I can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

I posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. It got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and I was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. Gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and I fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the Big Talk.

Little did I know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. I didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. So Thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, I got a dreaded ""WE NEED TO TALK"" text. Yep, all caps. And I was like ""welp, I'm dead.""

She was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). Still, she said I had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and I agreed/apologized. She knows I'm writing this update and she's going to read it before I post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

We talked for a long time Thursday night. She said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. It's partially a cultural thing, according to her. Gf was born and raised in the U.S. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. She said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class Americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. Gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. She grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

On top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. She said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. Gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. She also got very little affection from her parents growing up. It seems like that was all replaced with material things. So, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

All that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. She was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. She was really hurt that I said I thought I was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and I said I was sorry, and I am. I was still raging a little when I wrote that. I asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. It wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

We've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. I'm totally fine this. We've been together for almost 3 years and I think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. She's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. We spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. It's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. I'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. No one can change their habits overnight.

We're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. The plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. She also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. It's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. We're going to give it until my lease is up in March (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. She isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before March.

tl:dr: Thanks, Reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. I did and I think things are going to get better.

EDIT

To everyone who's wondering, her parents are from Mexico.

Gf has a job and her own income. She is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

Also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on Reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. You're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. In that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. That's now just out there for the whole world to read. You can't say that wouldn't be alarming. She said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. All things considered, I think she was pretty reasonable about it. Ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure I thanked Reddit for the perspective. No, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. She's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",relationship_advice

Should I (23F) tell my boyfriend (26M) about the egg?,"Pretty short and sweet. Together for 3 years, discussing marriage, have our own place finally, deeply in love. He admitted to me today that he has preemptively hid 50 eggs and 1 giant egg in our apartment for me to find tomorrow. This guy's pretty good! Up until then I hadn't seen any. But I just spotted the giant one. I really didn't mean to, I haven't been trying to look for them. 

Should I tell him so he can re-hide it? Or do I take it tomorrow?

Edit: I forgot to mention he had to tell me about the eggs because I was mentioning plans with eggs (we hide them together).

Edit update: he came to the room and I said ""What if I told you I found the giant egg?"". He laughed and told me ""Well, I got it way up there, since you found it early you'll have to work for it and get it down."" I jokingly pouted until he relented and said ""but if you need help I will."" 

I am not allowed to get it down until tomorrow though! Will update then :)

Mini update: doing my morning routine. SO left for church with his family while I get ready to go and clean a gentleman's house and answer some of the Reddit comments! One of the eggs was in my coffee pot. I guess some of these eggs don't stay closed very well, because it was taped shut as well as the ones sitting on my balcony table :) he put so much effort into this! I'm so touched, honestly. It kinda makes my kinky idea for egg hunting look lame by comparison! Will be back later once we're both home and I can hunt down all the rest of the eggs

UPDATE: firstly, a couple people I think asked so [here are the eggs in question](http://imgur.com/a/Lw1xoy3). The Reese's thing is more of a basket, but I won't question his use of the word egg to describe it. On the shelf I could only see a vague top part of it, but he did mention there's Reese's for me in the ""egg"" xD. If you bother to count the little ones there's only 48; I took one with me to the house cleaning (and checked to make sure it was strictly candy inside first!) And ""hid"" it in the gentleman's kitchen. As for the last one, both of us swear I found it, but I must have dropped it somewhere? Under the couch or something. Idk. In the giant egg there was candy and a frisbee. 

For everyone waiting on the edge of their seats, no proposal :c. BUT, I mentioned ""a proposal in this would have been pretty cute"" and he laughed and said ""yeah but you'll like the way I've got it planned MUCH better."". Which isn't much news to me, as I've said we've discussed marriage at length (I even have potential venues, the first draft of the guest list we both agree on, etc). All I've gotta do is sit tight and wait for him to DO IT.  I mentioned having hopes, but not expectations, so I'm not disappointed or letting it taint the happiness. Searching for the eggs was very fun!! I needed a couple hints, and to get the giant egg I needed quite a bit of terror inducing help including me getting stuck on the night stand I was using and him having to pick me up off of it :) 

And no, I don't think I missed any eggs or that he's hiding one. I think I really did grab them all, and misplaced one.

Now it's time for his turn to egg hunt! I'll put slips of paper in each egg I hide that have different ""prizes"" ranging from things I love about him, to kisses/massages, to more r rated things ;) So, that's all folks. No proposal, but a very happy Easter on both ends! Thanks for sticking with this tale of mine. Keep up all your great advice to everyone that needs it on this sub. And to those of you who seek advice for more serious problems than whether or not to admit to finding an egg; I've been there too. If you go through my posting history you'll actually find that SO and I went through a very rough patch on r/justnofamily. It took a lot of work on both sides to rebuild and have the healthy happy relationship we have now!

TLDR; boyfriend hid eggs. I found eggs. Reddit hoped for a sparkly in one of the eggs, but alas, the only sparklies are the foils covering my mini Reese's :) but a proposal *is* somewhere on the horizon!

Edit: oh and if anyone is wondering how to propose to their SO, Easter eggs *are* a cute idea.",relationship_advice

TIFU by drinking peanut butter,"Quick statement, This isn't my account, but u/TheGemScout is a close friend of mine and since I don't use reddit I figure someone should get the karma, if you guys happen to enjoy my pain. (Also, this was about a week ago, not today sadly)

So lets preface this. There's an episode of Two & a Half Men where Jake melts a jar of peanut butter into liquid, then He offers Charlie some. 

So I'm at my friend's house, let's call the friend Mason, and we're watching reruns of the show. We see that fatefull scene and Mason thinks it'd be a good idea to dare me to drink peanut butter. 

Two things before we proceed:

1. Our dares are intense, but we never refuse them.

2. While it's apparently weird, I despise peanut butter, not that I'm allergic or anything, but I really hate the stuff.

Knowing that refusing the dare is not an option (or else I'm going to get pranked to no end over it) I decide we should just get it over with now.

So my friend hands me the tallest coffee  mug he owns and says ""get to scooping"" while he laughs in my face

Once He's made me fill the cup with peanut butter, he puts in in the microwave for like 1:30 seconds and then motions for me to get the cup before it hardens. Here's where my fuckup begins:

I drink coffee often, so I'm not very careful about it being hot, and assume it's much MUCH cooler than my typical coffee as I heat that up for about 2 minutes or more before I drink it. 1 minute is nothing to me, and Seeing as I'm not trying to taste this disgusting flavor of nutty origin, I try to slam it down as fast as possible.

Actually the biggest mistake of my life, as not only does peanut butter heat up MUCH faster than a typical liquid, It's VERY thick and Insanely sticky. It was like Satan came in my mouth but it was stuck there and I couldn't get it out. My friend is still laughing his ass of and I'm screaming at the top of my lungs as it goes further into my throat and I begin choking on the molten shit-liquid itsself. At this level I'm thinking ""I'm choking on lava"" and ""I really hope I don't die because of the one time I eat peanut butter""

In my suffering I finally stammer out ""Take me to the ER"" and his face Immediately changed
 
I go for the milk we have in the fridge so I can walk out the door, but lucky me; we have not one drop of milk, nor any other liquid other than fucking A1 sauce, so I grab the sprayer in the kitchen sink and start blasting it in my mouth so as to mitigate the damage, but I can already tell that I've got some pretty severe burns.

Flash forward to the Hospital, and Thanks to my idiocy I have second degree burns all over my mouth and throat, and After almost a week, I'm still in constant pain. I can't taste anything except pain, I have burns on and around my tongue, my gums The roof of my mouth, my throat, and Can barely sleep due to the intensity of the pain.

FML, and Fuck peanut butter. Never drink it, or you'll end up like me.

"TIFU by having sex with a tampon in, losing it, and having to get my professor remove it (NSFW)","This happened last night. Put a tampon in around 6pm and went about my evening activities. I had a busy night, but at the end of the night I got to see my boyfriend. Totally forgot about the tampon and we had sex. I have a pretty light flow/low key periods due to an IUD, so between that and my busy day I totally forgot I had a tampon in. 

We wake up this morning and I remember. My stomach drops. I immediately go to the bathroom and I can't feel it. Its gone. I tried switching positions, squatting, had my boyfriend try, everything I could think of. Nothing. After close to a half hour of trying, hoping, and praying to the Vagina Gods, I accept my fate. This shit is GONE. 

At this point I'm worried that I'm never finding this thing and it's going to be stuck inside of me forever. I also know the risk of contracting TSS if I keep it in much longer so I know I need to get it taken care of sooner rather than later. After class I'm off to our Student Health Center. I go to a small college, so the doctor is only in for an hour a day. I strategically timed it so that I WOULDN'T see the doctor-- he teaches one of my classes, Gen Med, at night once a week. I wasn't keen on having my professor dig through my vagina to find a lost tampon, so I was hoping the nurse could do it. 

Nurse is very nice and reassuring but says I have to wait for the doctor. Great. Some time later I'm in a gown, in the stirrups, waiting for my professor to come in, just full of dread. He comes in and is super friendly because he knows me from class, which is the last thing I wanted. Really wish he would have just stayed silent at this point and pretended that he didn't know me. 

He starts the vaginal exam and the following exchange occurs:
Dr, to the nurse: ""well, she got some pretty good news last night""
Me: "".........""
Dr: ""Theres no final in Gen Med!""
Me: ""..oh""

I for real thought he was commenting that the sex was good. Don't get me wrong, it was, but that was even more mortifying than being in the stirrups, naked from the waist down, having my professor look at my vagina. 

He finds the tampon after 5 long, agonizing minutes of searching. I have his class in a few days. Not sure how I'm going to look at him. I'm a 4.0 student and I've never felt more stupid in my entire life. 

TL;DR: forgot I had a tampon in and had sex, losing the tampon. Had to go to the health center to get it removed by my professor, who is also the campus physician. 

Edit: i was dumb enough to say ""stupider"" instead of more stupid, as many of you have pointed out. Its been a long day, ya'll. 
 
Edit 2: turns out ""stupider"" was fine. Lesson learned: those terms are interchangeable, trust your gut. Also, take your tampon out before sex. 

Edit 3: wow, I didnt really expect this post to blow up like it did. Thanks for making a story about my vagina make the front page, guys. 
For those of you asking, it ended up near my cervix. It was too small/deep for me to have much success getting it myself, because when you lean forward to do a self-exam, the vaginal canal tightens. 
Thanks for the supportive messages, I didn't realize this was such a common problem. Makes me feel a lot better, lol. ",tifu

AITA for not wanting my in-laws to visit our new baby?,"Just to preface, my husband's brother has two kids, and his parents babysit them at least 3 days a week. I feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. 

I just had a baby on July 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. I know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like I have to entertain also. It would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that I expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). She also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores I could get in while he's asleep don't get done. 

She texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. This is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and I'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. I wrote her back and told her that I'm really not up for visitors this week because I'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. She hasn't talked to me since yesterday after I wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her. AITA here?",AmItheAsshole
Found cash in my walls. It's mine right? Can I deposit them in the bank & pay back my student loans? (Washington). Update: It is deposited and my student loans are paid back!,"[My question](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72wjbw/found_cash_in_my_walls_its_mine_right_can_i/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

I watched the VHS tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. That's why he kept his savings in cash. He didn't even trust a safe deposit box. That's why they were kept in his walls. And it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. I found the other $20,000.

I went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. She talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

I scheduled an appointment with the bank. When I told them it's for a cash deposit they told me I don't need an appointment for that but I told them it's for a large deposit. They still said no appointment is necessary, but then I said it's a very large deposit. So they booked the appointment. Everything went smoothly at the bank. They made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. Money was in my account a few hours later.

I made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and I now have a larger emergency fund.

Thanks! ",legaladvice
Can Marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?,"They're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the Western at some point. Talk about franchise fatigue. Yeah, *Marvel isn't immune*. They're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

And, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest Marvel releases. 

From a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. The stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

They're almost identical to the Transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

No, I'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up RT with fresh scores for every Marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 Stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, I guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". These films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

Of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, Marvel is the one that earned that success the least. It just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. No. No, I'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. They're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",unpopularopinion
My wife (30F) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. I (30M) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. Our relationship is not sustainable and I need help.,"Hi, everyone. This will probably be lengthy as I have nobody in my life to talk to about this. This is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

My wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. We have been together for 11 years and married for 8. She has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. She previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. Well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. Following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. Ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. We also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

The following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""Standard Operating Procedures"" of our household:

&#x200B;

* If I touch a light switch I need to wash my hands
* If I touch a door knob I need to wash my hands
* If I go to the garage I need to take a shower before I      can sit down or do anything
* If I touch her pajamas or I touch towels then I need to      take a shower
* If I *even enter* the guest bathroom then I have      to take a shower
* If my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* I am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* She stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much TP as a regular person would).      The cleaning process is 3 Chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. I have to immediately shower after this.
* If she spills excess *water* on the floor then I      have to mop it and anywhere I walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where I walked after stepping in the water.
* She goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. Every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. She washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. If she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. If,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      If her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. She discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. She uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" As you can see, this adds up      and I end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. This doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* If I change out laundry and **I graze the doorframe** when I enter the bedroom with clothes, I have to discard ALL OF THEM.
* If an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* If I even *touch* the dishwasher I have to wash my      hands.
* If she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will NOT      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. This means if she is hungry or thirsty I will bring it to her.
* Her showers last around 40 minutes. She bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. Our water bill is ridiculous.
* If my son (2 YO) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. This includes      naps. If I take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. Not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* When I clean the house (which I dont mind, btw.      Cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. No deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200B;

1. Change out laundry and leave washer free
2. Wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. Sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. Pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. Sanitize all counters
6. Clean kids bathroom
7. Take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. Take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. Take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. Clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. Take shower
12. Put bathroom rugs in washer
13. Take shower
14. Sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. Mop house in very specific order
16. Take shower

I want to make this clear - I have no problem with cleaning but I often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and I get berated. My wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. Often, I have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so I will be doing it after midnight. Of course I will make mistakes when I am mentally exhausted.

&#x200B;

* If I bring her water, I have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. She thinks that      if I hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. I do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* If I have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. She thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. This is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* If my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. He gets out often because she wont close the door.
* My wife **will not touch doorknobs**. She uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* If I leave the house with my phone, I cannot bring it      back into the house until I sanitize it. That includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* No shoes on the in house, ever. I had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. I had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop TWICE where they walked.
* Her depth perception is abysmal. We get in so many      fights because she thinks that I touched her with a dirty object when I      was *halfway across the room.* When she gets dressed, I half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. Same with pants.
* We never have people over because of her fear of      infection. Plus, I am the one who has to clean and sanitize so I am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

There is more things I have to deal with but I cannot remember every situation right now. The worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). I have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. I wash my hands over 50 times a day. I have gotten to the point where I just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. I fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. I get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. And this is not because of my kids.

You may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" We did that about two months ago. My dad may be the only person who really knows what I am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. That is exactly what I did. I told the counselor everything that I just revealed to all of you. I have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" The counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. My wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. After the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

I want to say one last thing. Before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. We loved each other and felt we were meant to be. I still love her and want it to work. I have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. I am physically and mentally exhausted. I have thought of leaving multiple times but I am afraid of how it will affect my kids. We also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. My wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (I dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

Has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? Thank you for taking the time to read and I appreciate any and all advice.

**TL;DR** \- My wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  I want to make something clear.  My children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  They dont do what I do - that is the one thing I absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  But yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  I talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how I feel - again.  She broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  When I get home we will continue to address this.  ",relationship_advice

A woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband opening the front door,"""Hurry!"" she said, ""stand in the corner.""

""Oh, it's just a statue,"" she replied nonchalantly. ""The Smiths bought one for their bedroom. I liked it so much, I got one for us too."" 

No more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.

Won $2000 scholarship from a gaming tournament while I was in high school. They said I had to wait until college to receive the money. The organization is shutting down. Can I do anything to still receive my money?,"**location:** I live in Rockville, Maryland, and the organization is based in Rowland Heights, California (I believe)

Basically, I won this high school gaming tournament where the winners were promised $2000 college scholarship money. The other winners (my teammates) started college in previous years and have already received their money.

I only started college this year, but after contacting them about the money they have almost completely ignored me. They gave me vague answers about how they'll get this sorted out ""by the end of the school year"" (WTF?). I suspect that the organization has run out of money and is shutting down. Their website is no longer up, and they are no longer running their yearly high school tournament.

There was no written contract, but the money was promised. They also made a Facebook post after the tournament saying ""Congratulations to this team (mine) for winning $2000 each in scholarship money!"", and included a photo.

Thanks in advance! This is a massive amount of money for me (broke college student) so any advice is greatly appreciated!

Edit: to make it clear, this is a small organization, not a big company

edit: I have been contacted by the organizers and they claim they are working on it right now... I think I will still pursue action, especially if they don't give me a definite response on when I can receive my money.

My [33 M] wife [32 F] hit me at a family BBQ. Everybody laughed.,"I don't think I'd ever felt more pathetic than I did at that moment. We'd gotten into an argument. She wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). I'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. I didn't think I should drive. My sister was also urging me to go. She was standing right there when my wife hit me. It was square across the face. I'd just told her there was no way I was driving since I'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. My wife called me an asshole... Then wham...

My sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. Everyone around us laughed. Maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but I can't say for certain. Nevertheless I felt humiliated.

The thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. It started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). It was infrequent at first. She was always super apologetic. Over time it escalated. She started throwing and smashing things. Screaming. Berating me. Hitting, kicking, and punching me. I don't even know how it got so bad. It just is and I feel trapped. Who in their right minds would believe me? Who would ever think she was capable of this? Sometimes I feel like I'm hallucinating it all and I'm just losing my mind. She was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? I don't even know.

Now people do know and it doesn't even matter. It's funny. I'm funny. It's so fucking funny. Look at him getting hit by his wife. So damn funny.

I want to disappear. I would if it weren't for my kids.

I don't even know what my question is. I don't really have one.

Is even possible to come back from this? I wish I could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

Thank you so much to everyone who replied with supporting and uplifting messages on my original post. I was unsure about posting but needed to get things out and you all helped me through a few of the most emotionally trying days of my life. 

A little update on what has been going on in the last few weeks:

The dust has settled and things have started to become kind of normal being here. My kids are adjusting and my 3 year old told me today he ""loves his new house"". He asks for daddy nightly saying ""I just want daddy be happy. I just want daddy not be mad any more"" and it breaks my heart but I just tell him I love him and hold him when he is hurting. I realized even being here I am happier than I ever was at home through the 4 and a half years of abuse and my life finally has some peace in it. I don't feel like I'm constantly about to fall off the edge of a cliff from the constant anxiety of not knowing what he was going to do next. 

The shelter has provided me with a wonderful advocate, as well as one for the children. My 3 year old has been doing play therapy for a couple weeks now and I've seen steady improvements in his behavior working through the trauma. 

They have also provided me with legal aid for custody and child support at no cost. The attorney is amazing and is going to fight tooth and nail for us, asking for the dad to only have supervised visits here and there. They are also filing a long term protective order. 

We have our own room here which is amazing to help have bonding time at night and kind of personalize it to make it more of a home for the kids. 

I will be starting work again next week. My HR manager contacted the store up where I am now to have me transferred because of the situation. I am so thankful the company I work for has bent over backwards to keep me employed, even though I've had to take the last few weeks off while I get things in order. 

The shelter is also paying for 6 weeks of daycare starting on Wednesday for BOTH children while I start getting paychecks again and we can start on getting child support. The daycare facility is wonderful and I'm so excited for my kids to start and have fun socializing with other kids their age while I start work again! 

Since I am able to start work again too I was able to get all my paperwork for transitional housing submitted where they will pay for 6 months in an apartment and help me renew my massage therapy license to get us back on our feet outside of the shelter! 

I was able to get back to my apartment with 2 police escorts for some belongings but could not get any of the kids documentation. I was however able to take their father off all contact info from their pediatrician and went in to get their vaccination records and health statements and was able to use those for new social security cards for the children and the shelter is getting them new birth certificates. 

A detective from the town we were in called me in for an interview and my advocate made the 40ish minute drive with me to be there while I handed over all text messages, pictures and voice recorded evidence. The detective was originally going for an arrest but when he realized some of the worst documented abuse (being punched in the face while pregnant and splitting my lips open) was in a different county, he had me also go over to our old town and file reports there. So, in our most recent town he will be prosecuted on a Class C family violence charge by citation and have to answer to a judge, but in our old town where the assault when I was pregnant happened he will be prosecuted on a Class A and he will be arrested and spend some time in jail. 

He has stopped texting me and calling me with threats after he tried to file a false police report saying I kidnapped the children and also filed a false CPS report. I handed over all evidence to CPS as well and they immediately closed it saying they ""can tell he is not being honest"" as this is the second time in a few months a false report has been filed. He DID text me a few days ago saying we didn't need to get attorneys though and let's just go file a custody agreement, but I didn't respond. If I even let him see the children until things get worked out I risk losing them for putting them back in a situation to be exposed to more abuse. 

His mom is in town with no return ticket and texted me asking to see them but she will not be seeing them either as she has also been in on plans to try and take them back to Florida so I would never see them again.... 

So, things are moving along. It has been back to back appointments, meetings, counseling, paperwork but I've never been more proud of myself and the decision to finally get out for my babies and me. I feel like things are pulling together even faster than I imagined. It's stressful... by the end of the day sometimes I just want to cry still, but it's not sad tears... just exhausted tears. 

I hope one day I can help advocate for women and children in homes affected by domestic violence and let them know these resources ARE available. It's not just a bed... the help we have received is beyond what I ever could have imagined and hoped for and I will never be able to fully express my gratitude in words or writing.

AITA for choosing my brother over my marriage?,"My parents divorced when I was 3, and went into separate marriages. I had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. When I was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. I had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

Five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. My mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. My father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. Obviously my family is morning, and I've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

The only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and I'm not going to let that happen. I told my wife that I was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. She did not take it well and is furious that I would choose my brother over her. I doubt my marriage will survive, but I can't let my brother go into foster care.

My (17F) stepdad (51M) has been sleeping with my sister (24F),"**TLDR; I went through my sister's texts and found out she was sleeping with my stepdad. My mom is at my aunts house now and I don't know where my stepdad and sister are. I don't know what to do or think about all of this.**

Throwaway account because I don't want this awful part of my life on my main account. Don't really care if my sister ends up seeing it because there's obviously nothing here that she doesn't already know!!

The title is pretty self explanatory. I'm still processing everything so I apologize if this post is a mess. Some context: my sister and I have different dads (my mom has been married twice, had my sister out of wedlock). My dad died when I was 11 and my mom married my stepdad 2 years later.

I came home pretty high last night around 1am thinking everyone was asleep. I was about to walk into the kitchen but jumped half a foot because my stepdad was standing there in the dark leaning over the sink. He had to have heard me but didn't turn around, and being there kind of creeped me out so I went upstairs. I heard someone throwing up in the bathroom and when I looked out the window I didn't see my sisters car (she moved out but ran out of money half a year ago and moved back into the basement) so I knew it was my mom in the bathroom. I knocked on the door to make sure she was okay but she didn't answer and I could hear her crying. I assumed she wanted to be alone and I figured me being high off my ass wasn't going to help so I just went to bed.

When I came downstairs this morning I couldn't find anyone, and there's usually someone there to drive me to school (I'm in high school, don't drive, and live out of district). We never leave later than 7 but I still couldn't find anyone by 7:30 and no one was answering my calls/texts. I still felt weird about last night but thought maybe it just seemed weird because I was baked and tired but it was obvious at that point that something was going on.

I got a text from my mom around 8 saying she was sorry but everyone is okay and she'll write me a note for school tomorrow. She wouldn't tell me what was going on but my sister ended up coming home looking like shit. Whenever I tried asking her what was going on she'd either ignore me or tell me to fuck off, and she was frantically going into the basement and bringing up her things and putting them in her car.

I could tell she was disoriented and at one point she left her phone on the kitchen table and went to the bathroom. I grabbed her phone (yeah yeah I know reddit is judgmental about that shit and I get it but I had no idea what was going on with my family and I was so worried I felt sick) and saw she had been texting my mom apologizing over and over and saying she knows that she's a slut and said something about how Shaun (our stepdad) isn't even related to her and that it ""wasn't as many times as you think."" I don't remember exactly what else she said because I only pulled random words from it before my sister came out and saw me but I pieced two and two together. She ripped the phone out of my hand so hard her nail cut my thumb and when I asked if she fucked Shaun she didn't answer and got in her car and left.

I was shaking like crazy and felt like I was going to be sick. I couldn't stand being in our house alone so I got my boyfriend to leave school during lunch and come get me. I've been at his house since and haven't heard from anyone all day except for my aunt (mom's sister) who texted me asking where I was. She said my mom was staying with her and wanted to make sure I was safe and told me to just stay at my bfs if I could.

I don't know what the fuck to do in this situation. I'm so grossed out and I can't help but think about all the signs and ways that we didn't notice. Like I said my sister moved into the basement and my stepdad's office is down there, none of us have a reason to go down there aside from doing laundry so it very well could have happened there.

An hour or two ago I started freaking out because I remembered a few weeks ago I went to my sister's friend's house with her and they were asking me if I've started watching porn yet. My sister brought up all this stuff she had saved on her phone and most of it was shit like ""sexy stepdaughter caught masturbating"" or ""stepdaughter begging for cock"" or something like that idk. I asked her why she watches stuff like that and she told me to ignore the titles, if you turn the sound off the story doesn't matter... When I brought it up with my bf he said that there's a lot of that kind of stuff going around right now and some people do watch it for the visuals and ignore the title/context. But he agrees that it's probably too much of a coincidence.

For a bunch of unrelated reasons my mom and I have both had kind of a bad relationship with my sister for a long time, but since she moved back in we've been working really hard to improve things with her and I finally started to feel like we were real sisters. I really want to believe that it was all my stepdad taking advantage of her (that sounds bad when I type it out but I just can't understand why she'd do this to my mom) but with the porn and stuff idk. Plus she was apologizing to my mom a lot and my mom didn't seem to be answering her. My sister was already in college when my mom met Shaun so maybe he never thought of her as a kid?

I really don't know if he's the kind of person who does this (I mean I know he did, but yeah I don't know the full story yet) because to be honest I just don't know him that well. He married my mom pretty soon after my dad died and I don't think any of us were ready but my mom was lonely. I don't know what she sees in him, he's pretty boring and works a lot and just watches sports and stuff but he never struck me as being a bad person.

This is getting rambly and I don't know what details are important so I'm sorry if parts don't make sense. I just needed to get it out and see if anyone else has gone through this or has any suggestions about what to do? Is this a common thing that happens??

My boyfriend thinks I should give my mom space even though I want to comfort her because we're both still processing it. I don't know where my stepdad and sister are and I kind of want to know but also really don't.

Edit edit: I realize now based off of the comments that I didn't explain this very well: my sister and I have different dads. My mom had my sister when she was really young/not married, then married my dad and had me, and then married Shaun. Shaun is technically my sister's stepdad too, but she refuses to call him that. She had already moved out and wasn't really around when he was dating my mom and moved in, so he's even less of a father figure to her than he is to me (he really isn't like a dad to me and we aren't close at all, but calling him my stepdad is just easier and technically correct).",relationship_advice

[Update] Dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. Am I wrong to be angry?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

You guys are right. I can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. I resent this man so much. I can't stand the sight of him. 

After I posted yesterday, I was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. To no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. I picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. I heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but I didn't bring up any of our hardships. My mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. I did, I forgave him but that doesn't mean I need to have a relationship with him anymore. Again, my family protested that I'm being cruel and heartless. I'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. I told them I would not be present at any family events if he was there.

My sister shouted at me claiming ""He is our dad. You asshole"". Yes he is, to which I replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. I told them I had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. My sisters need to return the iPhone's that are on contract as I am cancelling those. Driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that I pay for. These are dad's responsibilities now. Ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

I have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. I need a break.

I'm done. I'm done taking over dad's role. I'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. I'm 25 and I need to live my own life now. I don't think this will burn bridges. It's just a wake up call for them.

Edit: I'm not going to ghost or abandon them. They need to become independent now.

I think I've fallen in love with my girlfriend? I need some advice.,"So full disclaimer: I'm 29, and I don't think I've ever been in love before.

I've been dating my girlfriend for the past 4 months or so. The first month or 2 I knew her, she wasn't sure if she was ready for a relationship due to bad break ups, so we had a bit of a rocky start where neither of us were sure where we were going, or what we were doing. But we continued to hang out, have fun together, until one day she asked me if it would be alright if she started calling me her boyfriend.

Fast forward to today - Despite our busy schedules we still manage to see each other every other day. I've met almost all her friends, and some of which I consider my friends now as well! I get along with her whole group, and she gets along great with my friends. We have many overlapping interests and activities which makes things amazingly fun when we get together. She spends the night frequently. I've met her parents and family, she has met mine. We both cheesily admitted we wished we could see each other every day.

The other day I was running my hands through her hair while we were falling asleep, just admiring everything about her. When suddenly, a realization dawned on me: ""I think I love her"".

The problem is, I've never experienced ""love"", I'm not sure what it is, or what it's supposed to feel like if that makes any sense? What I do know is I've never felt like this about any girl before. I never get tired of her - her corny jokes, her silly laugh, her competitive drive. Even her ""faults"" or ""negative"" traits I find endearing. I want to see her always, and I think about her a lot. Is this love?

I haven't said anything yet to her for 2 reasons.

1.) I want to be absolutely certain I love her before I say anything.

2.) It might be too soon to say it? 4 months is not a long time - and she has a history of bad Ex's that ended horribly, which made her slow to open up in the first place. For her to ask me if it's okay if she calls me her boyfriend was a big thing for her, so I imagine something like love is probably something even more difficult.

Am I in love? And if I am, should I say anything?

Hello, it's me. Sorry about the new username, I made the first account thinking I would just post & read the replies, so I couldn't remember the password as it was just a jumble of letters. Didn't expect so many responses, thanks for your insight everybody!

&#x200B;

It seems folks were split on whether I was being: 1) an arrogant dick, or 2) completely clueless. I think it was probably a little of both. After spending years of slogging by in medical school living like a student, making so much money does really excite me, and I probably came on too strong with offering to buy her everything. It wasn't meant to be condescending, I just want to share my newfound wealth with the people I care about. But, as many of you said, it was patronizing to try and solve her issues with money and to throw it around like it means nothing to me. In the future, I will be a bit more mindful of money can cause a power imbalance in relationships. 

&#x200B;

This is kind of a non-update, but I wanted to at least thank everyone for the help and tell you that I will take your advice and ease up a bit. I don't want to make her uncomfortable and feel like she's indebted to me. A couple of you suggested a take a page from her book and learn how to budget myself, so yesterday I texted her and asked if she could help me, and she said (and I quote), ""Yes, of course! Budgeting is fun, you'll love it!""

&#x200B;

Color me skeptical. But she clearly knows what she's doing, and, knowing her, she probably will make it fun!

(Texas) Dealership gave repo company my vin instead of the correct one. Wake up and car is gone. My car is paid in full.,"I purchased a car 6 DAYS AGO, I've been waiting for years to buy and I've loved it so far, until this morning. The auto group that sold it to me called me and explained to me on Friday that they had accidentally given the repo company the wrong vin. 
         
Same car, wrong vin. So I've been parking it in the  back where hopefully the tow truck would be too big to fit in the tight space but I guess they pulled it off cause now my baby has disappeared.

  Where do I start off? I'm pretty livid that this happened 3 days after he said he tried to contact them.

[UPDATE 1] The General Manager just called and asked if they seriously came and took it after they left a ton of messages to the Tow company to not to take the car. He said whatever is wrong with it will be made right and he quickly got off the phone to jump someone's ass about the situation. Let's see how this goes.

[Update 2] I'm considering asking for my money back from the car, the warranty I purchased, my first months car insurance, and for them to pay for a rental while I find my replacement. They royally screwed up and I don't want to deal with the headache of them having to fix the car and it possibly never being the way it was.

Edit: Just to add the car in question is a 2011 Cadillac CTS-V coupe. So hopefully my worries about it being damaged heavily are more easily recognizable.

EDIT 3: Called the police and they told me it's a civil issue (go figure) and I talked with my attorney. He told me I have grounds for a full refund but I should have the car professionally inspected by a reputable Cadillac dealership and find out the damage and how much to make it right first and make a decision there. He says it's complicated for who is to blame because of the scenario. I'm going to contact another Police department and see if I can get an official report and call the repo company and inform them of the mistake just in case the dealership hasn't. The last contact with the dealership was over 3 hours ago. Still with no news to the whereabouts of my car. I had to find it myself.

[BIG UPDATE] after contacting the Tow yard they told me the dealership never paid for the car or after they got it from auction, so there was still a lein on the car so I basically bought a stolen car from the auction. I cannot deal with them after this. This is the shadiest thing I've ever been a part of and I'm dumbfounded I've found myself here. 

[Another EDIT] so they're trying to work with the finance company to get my car taken care of but it turns out my car wasn't the only one affected. This is happening to multiple cars all purchased through this company and I'm not going down without a fight. I'm getting out if this deal, it's way too hot for me.

[Update 6] dealer says they had bought the car on a ""floor plan"" which he explained is how they use the bank to buy a few cars from auction all at once. They closed this and paid the bank but the lein still exists until its sold and the automated system didn't pick it up that the car had sold and only saw a title transfer so it assumed I had taken it and just retagged it as mine. The dealer has offered me a loaner and says the car will be back tomorrow. He told me they could refund the deal if it really comes down to it but I would lose the money I spent paying taxes on it which is understandable. I'm gonna have the car professionally inspected and see if there's any damage and I'll decide then on how I want to proceed. This has been a roller coaster today.

[Edit thoughts] they say the car will be back tomorrow and I can use a loaner for however long but after finding it's been through auction I'm not sure on trust the car itself. I'm sitting on a spiky fence of letting my dream car go back and getting  my money back and finding another or just making the dealer fix the car. I feel like this is going to be a long road for me. I've missed a day of work and haven't come any closer to finding my car. I miss it so much",legaladvice
TIFU by getting a DNA test and revealing a family secret,"I've always been interested in doing one of those at-home kits that tell you your ethnicity estimates.  My mother has, for many years, claimed that her own great-grandmother was completely Native American, and I recently learned that this is apparently something common for Southerners to claim, but that it is rarely true.  I finally went ahead and bought one of the kits because there is nothing I enjoy more in life than proving my mother wrong.  

Fast forward a few weeks.  I get my results.  I am 0% Native America, which isn't exactly shocking.  The real surprise comes from the fact that I am also 0% Eastern European.

This probably wouldn't mean much for most people, but I happen to be Polish.  Or at least, I thought I was.  I have an unpronounceable, very Polish last name.  My great-grandparents were Polish-speaking immigrants.  My paternal grandfather himself spoke Polish as a child.

My first thought was that the test was a mistake.  My results came over a week before the projected arrival date, and I KNEW I should be somewhere around 25% Polish/Eastern European.  So maybe there had been an error somewhere at the lab.  I started digging around through my DNA relative matches.  I had matched with an extended cousin with my mom's maiden name, living in the state that she grew up in.  So the DNA analyzed was definitely mine, and this was not a switched-tube situation.

There were only two possible explanations:  either my own dad was not my biological father, or my Polish grandfather was not the biological father of my dad.  

I look a lot like my father, so it seemed unlikely that we were not related.  However, there was no strong family resemblance between my dad and his own father.  In fact, my grandfather and many of his siblings had a (we'll call it) striking nose that my sister and I had often rejoiced in not inheriting.  Also, my paternal grandparents had a disastrous marriage and bitter divorce—an affair did not seem out of the question.

My paternal grandfather died over ten years ago, but my paternal grandmother is still living and I gave her a call.  It took a while for me to fully explain the DNA testing to her—she's 87, but we got there.  She denied it and tried to explain the unexpected results with a long ramble about migrating European tribes before I was finally able to make her understand that I would be able to test relatives from the Polish side of the family and determine whether or not I was actually related to them.  She told me that she didn't think that was a good idea, and I should think about it before contacting anyone.

I think I knew right then, but it was not until today, two days later, that she finally admitted it to my sister:  my father had been lied to his entire life about his biological father.  

So who is my actual paternal grandfather?  TBD.  My grandmother promised my sister that she will tell the two of everything when my sister gets into town for Christmas.  She requested that we not tell anyone until then (it's too late, my sister already told everyone).  

TL;DR:  Did an ethnicity test, found out my father was apparently the product of an extra-marital affair and never knew.  

Edit to add: I've had a recent string of people asking me for an update.  I posted one a while back, here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7kat5w/tifupdate_and_the_grandfather_is/  ",tifu

[UPDATE - WE BROKE UP] I [21f] got blackout drunk and told my friends [21f 22f 22f] that my boyfriend's [25m] jacked off to their instagram pics,"Long story short, I broke up with Pete. But if you want the details… I'd been feeling kind of insecure about his loyalty to me for a while, the Instagram thing from my last post was just the tip of the iceberg. 

&#x200B;

Then, shortly after Christmas, i got a text from Bridget, a friend from college, we're in the same program, we have a lot of classes together and study together for our exams. We're not super close friends outside of studying, we have different interests and groups of friends, but we still spend a lot of time together doing homework and studying.

&#x200B;

She basically said that she had something that was weighing on her. She hadn't wanted to tell me before exams, because she knew I was stressed and just trying to make it through finals week… Then she didn't tell me before Christmas, because she didn't want to ruin my holidays, but she felt like she had to say something now. i asked her what it was, and she told me that Pete had been dm-ing her and trying to hit on her, and she hadn't answered and he just escalated, getting mad at her for being online but not answering, then she blocked him. She said nothing went on, she was disgusted by how he'd hit her up when he was in a relationship with me. 

&#x200B;

she sent me screenshots so I know she's for real. Anyway, i was taken aback when she first told me, but the more I think about it, the less I am surprised. I was glad she waited till after exams to tell me, this week has been messy emotionally and I know it would have hurt me academically if I was going through all this during finals week.

&#x200B;

So yeah, I'm not feeling the best right now, i feel pretty damn hurt and used, but i guess the silver lining is that I'll be going into my next semester drama free, and 190 pounds lighter.

TIFU by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.,"So, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. One of the classes I was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. While the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. For our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. I did my paper on helium-3 power generation. I worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. The papers were due last night at midnight and I held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. This is where I fucked up big time.

Let me tell you a little about myself. I don't work a normal job. I tried it in my first year of school and I really didn't like it. I've worked internships when they came up but outside of that I really didn't ""work"". This and being a student really doesn't mix well though. So, I had to make money some way. For the past 3 years I've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. Specifically, for furries. I would write anything. Any fetish, any premise, anything. In some parts of that community I became really popular. At one point I was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts I charged  to my customers. Am I proud of this? No. I have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. I told myself the minute I got a ""real"" job I was cutting and running from this work.

Well, this brings us to last night. I had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. I had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. I was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. I was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. I ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. However, instead of submitting my final paper, I somehow submitted one of the commissions I was working on. This commission is not light either. It is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

So, I went to bed. Submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. When I woke up this morning I checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

I want to fucking die right now. I don't know how I'm going to explain why instead of my final I submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. But yeah, I fucked up big time.

Tl:Dr: In my final semester at college. Instead of submitting my final research paper, I submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. Professor ""want's to talk"" and I want to die.

obligatory update:

Well, I just left his office and I still want to die. Not as much though. I took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  I won't lie, When I sat down with him I was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. I guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

I ran down pretty much everything I said here. While he didn't agree with the avenue I was taking to make money he understood why I was doing it.

He had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""Customer\_Commission\_2nd draft.doc""). I've taken a class from him before and was an A student so he guessed I had submitted the wrong file on accident. He told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

I gave him the copy I brought and he accepted it. He told me to email him the file and he would replace the one I had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" He seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what I had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

Like I said. I still want to fucking die right now. At least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . Thanks I guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",tifu
TIFU: My friend brought her new date over for dinner and I jokingly vetted him in front of everyone by asking if'd ever killed anyone. He said yes.,"As it's often the case, this didn't happen today, but a few years ago when I was maybe 15yo, young and naive.

My mom's best friend back then was V, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.

V is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. After losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. She brought to our home a few men over the years.

One of those times, V had invited over for dinner a man (let's call him A) who she introduced to us as a ""good friend"". A was a middle-aged man originally from Bosnia. He now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.

For those of you not fully aware of Bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. It's a small country in the Balkans (Eastern Europe, north of Greece), and it used to be part of the former Yugoslavia. Long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including A.

That evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know A better. He seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. We start asking him questions about how long he's been out of Bosnia, etc.

I start to think of something witty to say to ""vet"" him. Something funny.

I asked him if he'd ever killed someone, jokingly.

He looked at me, all serious. He said yes. Everyone became silent.

He went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. They were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person's. He wasn't a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.

I felt horrible for asking this. When I thought I was just making a joke, I opened up some really painful memories. Things that were not easy for him. Still today, many years later, i can't imagine how he must feel living with such memories. And it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.

After a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. We never spoke about that again.

—

TL;DR: I thought I'd make a funny joke and ask my friends' date at dinner if he'd ever killed anyone. Turns out, he did during the civil war in former Yugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. The joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day.",tifu

According to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. I tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. According to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. I've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but I've been unable too. They cut of the internet, phone and TV Tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. I'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way I've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. Last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. I was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that I will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.

&#x200B;

I need to know what the fuck I can do here. My dad has shared custody of me and since Monday i've had no contact with him. He is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. I tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. He lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. I'm at a friends house because I was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after I told my parents I wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. Her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and I plan to stay here tonight if I can. My parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

&#x200B;

I'm so lost right now it makes me sick. I do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and I need to know what the fuck I can do here. Can I just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. If my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

&#x200B;

Edit:

I talked to my mom and told her because I would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times I could see my friend I would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". I got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. He did not agree and was told I didn't want to talk to him. My 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. My sisters dad is going to call cps too and I just got done with my call to them but I wont repeat what they said here. I will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to Florida immediately if I don't check in with him or he hears I went back to her. He says that he is already looking into emergency custody (I want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. They both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). I also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. My dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. Thanks guys for the advice.",legaladvice

TIFU by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.,"The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  

The fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I've ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn't really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn't get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


So since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It's never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

After 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it's possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. 

So I'm up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I'm turning the light on I realize:

The goddamn thing is dimmable. 


For 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to ""dim"". 

Fuck me. 

TL;DR

For 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",tifu

Tricked into eating something I don't eat at work. Is this illegal/a toxic work environment?,"This is in Alabama. I'm really really upset over all of this so I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense. This happened last week and it was only brought to my attention today what exactly I ate and I'm a mess. My coworkers all cook a lot and bring in food for everyone. They all know I have food restrictions because I usually don't partake (which pisses most of them off because it's ""rude""). One girl brought in a pie and was very proud of herself, saying I could eat it. So I did because I'm a trusting idiot. My stomach was a wreck that night and the next day but I'm pregnant and have a weird stomach anyways so I didn't connect the dots. There's been some other shit since and I'm on even stricter rules right now. One of my coworkers was commenting on it all today after seeing me eat my sad work dinner, and said outright that it isn't the end of the world if I eat the stuff I'm not supposed to because ""a lightning bolt won't come from heaven and kill you"". I sort of gave her a look and she laughed and said it didn't when I ate the pie and told me what was in it. I'm so so upset right now. I genuinely don't know what to do or say. They've ignored my wishes and been outright hostile before but never like this. I went home crying last week over something else and filed with HR over it but they didn't take it seriously and this is just my breaking point. I'm not coming back after I have this baby but is there something I can do legally? TL;DR- Coworkers put something I don't eat into food and lied about it to me, saying they specifically made it safe for me. Now they told me they did it to prove a point. Do I have legal recourse?

AITA for being honest with my nephew about where I was for most of his life?,"Okay, let me just get right into this. I [27M] was kicked out at 16 because my older sister [37F] outed me to my parents as gay. They completely cut off all contact with me and I didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and Mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. When I was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. For the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

A couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and I ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. He asked me why I wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. I asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. I told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until I eventually confessed I was cut off for being gay. He made a face and asked how my parents even found out. I told him I was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that I don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. He got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

I got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that I'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". I explained to her that I didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and I think he's old enough to deserve honesty. She just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. I'm crushed because obviously I love the kid. Did I do the wrong thing? Should I have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",AmItheAsshole
Still my favorite joke I ever made up. :),"A monocle walks into a bar. After a few drinks he starts to feel pretty good (and a little uncoordinated). He reaches for a cigarette, but the bartender stops him. ""Sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. You'll have to step outside to smoke.""

So the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. Meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. They bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. They try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

The bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. ""Hey you two!"" he shouts. ""Stop making spectacles of yourselves!""",Jokes

[Shocking] My GF sisters boyfriend has a crush on her,"I'm [25/M]. I started dating this girl [22/F], it's only been 3-4 months, but ALOT has happened since then.

She has a sister [18/F] and her sister has a boyfriend [21/M]  who have been together for 6 months. When I first met her sister and her sister bf,  I thought they were cool, we always hung out and even lived together in one room at one point. My gf and her sisters boyfriend got along pretty well, but sometimes I think it was too much. 

Little by little I started noticing something weird about her sisters boyfriend. In the beginning I felt that he was too friendly with my gf, like too close but I always thought ""maybe I'm trippin, that's just how they are, it's nothing"" and left it alone. 

Then more weird shit happened. 
Like one night, all 4 of us went out to a bar, he grabbed my gf and started to dance. Nothing wrong with that, but what was weird to me was the way he then started to grab her and dance with her like it was a back in the day basement party. It was weird to me bc she tells me that they're like a brother and sister. Brothers and sisters don't dance that way. I ignored that situation and kept it moving.

Another time we went out again and right before going in the bar, he decided he wanted to take some pictures. So he gives my gf sister his phone and tells her to take a picture of them. They switch and my gf takes a pic of them two.  The weird part was that if you were to compare both pics side by side and I asked you, which one of these two is he in a relationship with, you would pick the one  he took with my gf. A picture says a thousand words. While my gf was just taking a picture just to take it, the way he grabbed her and looked at her was basically how me, as her boyfriend would grab her and look at her. She posted that pic but deleted it after I said it was weird and people kept asking her ""who's the lucky guy"" .  At this moment I was 80% sure that this kid had something for my gf. 

As time went on and my gf and I got real serious, his behavior towards me started to change. Every time i would Hug and kiss my gf or show her any affection, I'd feel the hate in his eyes.  He'd mention to my gf how things are different now, how she chose me over her ""family"" (him and her sister). He would make plans to go out to eat but he would make it clear that he just wants them 3 to go. When my  gf would say no, he'd get angry. 

It got to the point where one night my gf sister and her sister bf came over. Everything was all good. I wasn't there yet but when I arrived, she mentioned he was being weird towards me. It was like that the rest of the night. 

When they left, I finally decided to have that talk with my girlfriend. We had a long talk about that situation and other things. At first she didn't see things that way I seen them but started to put two and two together. She didn't want to accept the possibility that her sisters boyfriend could want her. She was not convinced But agreed that she might have unknowingly condoned his actions and that she'll be a little less friendly.  

At this time it was 10am, we still hadn't slept. Her phone made the notification noise. I looked over at the phone which was next to me, and it read: ""Lets fuck"" 

At this moment, we're both in shock. I grabbed the phone and showed her the DM. 

It was from her sisters boyfriend. 

Her:  ""maybe that's them playing around"" 
Me: ""you don't play around like that""

Her: ""it could have been my sister writing that""
Me: ""okay then, if that's what you think, let's                  call. If you're sister picks up, we pay attention to how she sounds. If she sounds like she's just waking up, it wasn't her playing games. But if he picks up, you go along with it, to see how far he'll go.""
Her: ""okay""

My GF calls, Her sister answers, in a groggy voice. Like she had just woken up.

GF: ""hey what are you doing?""
Sister: ""I was sleeping what's up""
GF: ""Where's your BF?""
Sister: ""he's laying next to me""
GF: ""look at what he just sent me""
Her sister hangs up. 

We call back 15 mins later to give them a chance to talk.

When We call back, gf sister answers. In the background, we can hear that they were arguing. A few seconds later, she hangs up and we don't hear from her again for the rest of the day.


A few days later, they explain that his page got hacked and it was one of his exes that had wrote that. Idk how he managed to make his girlfriend believe that but it must have been tough. My gf believed him, but still had her doubts. I in the other hand, don't believe it for various reasons. 

My gf and I spoke about it things and she said that she'll keep her distance. Either way I let it go and decided to move on. He would continue to come around but it wasn't the same. 


Few days went by. 

Yesterday, I call her to talk and see how her day is going. She picks up, crying. She says she's at her sisters house. Her sister was being taken by ambulance to the hospital because she couldn't breathe. I tell her to call me back asap. 

Time went by and I call to see what's going on. She picks up, i ask her what happened. She says she's home, her sister is doing fine, she's at the hospital with her parents. 

Me: ""how come you aren't at the hospital with her also?""
Her: ""they wouldn't let us in the room, only my mom and dad, and I was hungry so we left. 
Me: ""who are you with?""
Her: ""My sisters boyfriend, I told him to come instead of waiting there. ""

At this moment, I am bothered and disappointed. After all that we've been through, You're alone, in a house, with someone that you know I don't feel comfortable with. That's what I wanted to say, but did not say it bc I was on speaker. 

So we continue to talk while she starts to cook. There comes a point where her phone dies. I give her 8-10mins to call me back. (Takes 2-3mins for her phone to turn on). She doesn't call, so I call her. No answer. I wait 5 more mins and call again, no answer. I wait longer than 5mins this time and call. She picks up and says her phone died. 

Me: ""how come you didn't call back after it died?"" (She usually does right away)
Her: ""I was on the phone with my sister, she's ready to leave the hospital, now we have to find my parents and her a ride""
Me: ""oh""

Her sisters boyfriend finds a ride and leaves to pick them up from the hospital. My girlfriend stays and we continue to talk until she goes to shower. 

She calls back and her sister is there along with her boyfriend. We talk about the situation, and I patiently wait for them to leave so I can talk to my gf about how I felt bothered that she was there alone with him. 

When they finally leave, I express myself to her and tell her how I felt. From that point forward, a 4 hour argument commences. 

- She says that  I have no right to feel the way I felt. That's her ""brother in law"".  And that there was nothing at all wrong with him being alone with her.

I tell her, that I do have the right to feel bothered. It might be your brother in law but things changed when you received that text message from him. I feel disappointed bc you said you would keep your distance. Being alone in a house with him is not keeping your distance. 




I'd like to know what you guys think.  Am I overreacting? Or do i have a point. 

Am I the only one that thinks it's weird?  What would you do in my shoes?

Children should not be given a religion until they understand what one is.,"I felt like this and see it in many of my old friends. These kids have a religion pushed onto them and they have no idea what it is or what it means. They just follow their parents until it is similar to brainwashing. When they don't know what a religion is and only know what theirs entails, it is trapping a kid from a wide world of their own decisions and others views.

Me (15F) My mom (30sF) cares more about drinking and fucking guys than being a parent.,"Yo I'm 15 and utterly clueless how to deal with my ""mother""

That's in quotes because she doesn't act like one. Never has. I don't know who my dad was. Neither does she. Yep she's that kind of person.

None of my siblings dads are around. They're either locked up or didn't care or she refuses to talk to them for who knows why. She stopped persuing child support from the one she had contact with bc it was ""too much work"" but when she used to get the child support, she just spent it all on shit for herself. Like tattoos, alcohol, clothes.

She's addicted to online shopping, the apartment is stuffed with her shit and she doesn't even use most of it. Also she doesn't clean. I have to clean (I'm the oldest) or it doesn't happen. Before I learned to clean, we got tons of ants and flies, we had roaches for months before she finally was willing to pay for getting rid of them. Said she ""didn't want to waste money"", but she wastes money all the time on whatever she wants. Food and bills are an after thought. She has WIC but literally can't be bothered to get us food unless I nag her when we're flat out. Then she just loads up with garbage from the dollar store, so I'm really worried about my siblings, bc some of them are getting really overweight and she doesn't ever take us to the doctor and I don't even know if we've got health insurance.

She bounces around between temp jobs, nothing permanant, bc if she worked fulltime she couldn't party. She's almost always out at night sometimes during the day. Or she's passed out drunk. I've dragged her to her bed bc she blacked out in the bathroom or on the floor. Or, some random dude shows up after midnight hauling her in the door as she's unable to walk. How do these men have keys??? She just copies the key and gives it to literally ANYONE she trusts. Which is practically everyone, she has no idea who's a good person or bad person. As a result there are men who have touched me when I was younger. Now I can fight them and protect myself and my siblings. She never protects us. She doesn't care. She called me a liar bc that's her boyfriend so he wouldn't do that blah blah blah. 

There is a revolving door of these ""boyfriends."" They don't last longer than a year and even when she's with a guy guaranteed she's fucking at least one other. Me and my siblings can clearly hear the telltale slapping sounds and disgusting groaning and fakeass porno screeches coming from her room. It's happened at all hours of the night waking us up. We've even found nasty sex toys and fetish outfits in places outside of her bedroom.

She's pregnant right now (kid number 8) and STILL doing this. Still drinking too. I mean what the fuck, I started suspecting she's doing this for money (she's randomly suddenly had cash after nights like that after saying there was no money for food or whatever) and asked if she was a prostitute, she slapped me across the face. Well that's my answer I guess. I know she's been a stripper so it's more than likely. Anyway I still said why is she okay poisoning a baby and risking one of these abusive guys injuring it, she said I can't judge her until I'm a mother. So whatever. I'm never gonna be one looooool

Then, despite constantly being broke and relying on the minor government aid + whatever these fuckboys give her (she begs online for donations all over social media), she went and got a huge fucking boobjob a couple years ago. I was only 13 but I've been constantly aware of our poverty. I've been bullied for it, even my 5 year old brother got teased at school about his clothes. It's impossible to NOT be aware. I started learning when rent and bills are due to try to get my mom to keep on top of it so our electricity and heat stops getting shut off. Then she goes and buys fake tits. It's like, what is even the point. She's gonna blow her money every time no matter what I do.

I'm so scared and sick of always worrying about money. We've been evicted 5 times that I can remember. Utilities shut off countless times. Half the time I have to make my younger siblings ramen for dinner because it's all I can afford from the change she leaves us.

I'm so sick of the grossness of the apartment, the grossness of the men always coming and going, her dressing like a hooker, using her tits to get men now that she looks twice her age thanks to alcohol addiction, the trashiness of everything in my life. The apartment is 3 bedrooms with half the living room hosting me and my next oldest sister's bunk beds and the other half hosting my mom's piles of junk. The rest of my siblings are split between the other two bedrooms and then my mom has the third. Everyone's room is covered in clothes toys books and random junk on the floor, bc there's simply no space for anything that could store it. Garbage and masses of toiletries/cosmetics in the bathroom and mold in the shower. Garbage always overflowing in the kitchen. Dirty stove fridge and oven I can never stay on top of. Everything's old and falling apart. No AC or fans in 90+ heat. It's just shit. She couldn't care less she's hardly ever here so sees no reason to care.

I hate that I can't give my siblings a better childhood. I hate that she won't make a single effort to do that when it's her responsibility, SHE'S THE PARENT NOT ME, but I cannot stand to see them neglected. They all see me and my next oldest sister as parents more than her. We are ""their moms"" they say. We bathe them and dress them, do laundry when we can. We take care of each other when we're sick.

Please get one thing clear from my post besides that I hate my mom, it's that I love my brothers and sisters. I would do anything to make their lives just a little better. But I don't know how when we're stuck living in this place with this person. I realized we'll have to get out on our own for things to get better but even once I'm old enough, they won't be. I could adopt them but I doubt I could get custody of all 6 + the baby that's coming + however many fucking more kids she decides to pop out over the next 3 years.

Plus even though they listen to me about hygiene and chores they don't listen about school. No matter what I try, short of bribing with junk food I can't get them to do their homework. But I'm a hypocrit bc I don't always do mine either, I don't have time sometimes or I'm so tired I just can't.

Is there any way to make my mom be an actual mom? How do I at least get her to stop drinking while pregnant and stop hooking up with randoms. Like the older I get the more fucked up I see it is, and the angrier I am. I don't wanna hate everything but so many days I do.",relationship_advice
"My [30M] wife [29F] more or less abandoned me and the kids, with nothing more then a note. I don't know what to do.","Me \[30M\] and my wife \[29F\] have been married 5 years and have been together for 8 years. We met through an internship in university (she came from Korea, i came from Canada), we ended up both doing a long distance relationship thing for a year before we both ended up moving to Toronto for jobs as developers. 

To make things complicated her family has never really approved of me. I know very basic Korean that she taught me, but her family up until now has cut contact with me (they didn't come to the wedding, nor have they seen their grand daugthers). However she has always been extremely independent, and despises the idea that her family can control any part of her life, so she asked me to marry her (i was fine with that) only after living together for 8 months. 

Two years ago she gave birth to a pair of wonderful baby girls. However it became very obvious something was extremely wrong, she became a whole different kind of person after the birth. She became extremely protective and borderline paranoid of anyone other than me or her looking after her kids. 

Apparently the idea of her becoming a stay at home mom was insulting to her and she told me over and over that i needed to become a stay at home dad. Since she was the bread winner it was fine for me. About 6 months ago she was diagnosed with postpartum depression, and was given medication that made her much better (no more bizarre mood swings, or picking fights for no reason). 

Last weekend was the first time i have had some time off from the kids, i was going to my friends bachelor party at his cottage for the weekend and my wife was going to look after the kids. 

On Sunday morning i got a phone call from my sister who told me:

* My wife dropped the kids off with her as there was some emergency at the office on Saturday.
* She didn't come back to get them and it was now Sunday
* Her phone wasn't responding to her messages/calls. 

I freaked out and rushed home, only to find pretty much all her stuff gone. She left me a single page note that was basically told me that she was going back home to be with her family, and she was ""cutting ties"" with me as she couldn't be the person ""i wanted her to be"", and asked that i respect her decision. She also closed our joint bank accounts saying i had ""no right"" to that money as she earned it. 

I talked to one of her friends from work and she said she told me she put in her two weeks notice over a month ago so this has been planned for awhile.

I am pretty much a confused mess, my family is helping out, but its complicated. I talked to her parents and they basically refused to talk to me, and demanded that i leave her or them alone. I brought up their grand-children and her father told me point blank they aren't his.

What am i supposed to be doing. I don't really understand. 

TLDR; Wife ditched me and our kids, took our money and went back to Korea. I can't get in touch with her at all and this was all planned way in advance.",relationship_advice

"AITA for telling an infertile woman that ""fur babies don't count""?","Alt account. Ya boy done gone made a massive whoopsie. 

Basically I [20M] recently started a job where I have mostly female coworkers. Amongst them is a small group who all have young kids around the same age. They go to mum-and-kid activities together, babysit each other's kids, have coffee mornings, hang out at the weekends etc. There is one coworker who has  complained to me a few times that she feels deliberately left out by this group. She refers to herself as ""mama"" and often talks about ""the kids"", so I assumed she had children of her own and sympathised with her that she was being excluded from the mummy group. However, Friday I asked to see a picture of the kids...and she showed me a photo of three cats. Quickly dawned on me that she's a fur mama with fur babies, which I get bc I love my animals too, but it made it weird to me that she's pissed about being excluded from activities involving actual human children when she has none herself. When she later complained again about not being invited to something I kinda gently said ""maybe it's cause they're hanging out with their kids, I don't know if fur babies really count in that context"". Coworker got upset and ran out crying. 

Turns out, she's infertile and desperately wants kids but can't have them, so her considering her cats as her kids is how she copes. Obviously I feel *awful* now, I didn't mean to insult her or invalidate her feelings like that. Still I'm saved a little by the fact that I didn't know, right?

TIFU by letting my wife into the bathroom while I was taking a shower,"So we had just finished having a wholesome breakfast of eggs, potatoes and cinnabread my wife made and I hopped into the shower. When I shower I listen to a bluetooth speaker, mostly youtube. Midway through my shower my wife unlocked the door and busted in claiming she had to pee. I'm a private person and always shower with the door locked, but obviously she isn't. After she finished she asked to come into the shower, but I was in the midst of shaving my legs (yes I'm a guy, I just don't like body hair) and told her no because I had a razor in my hand and our shower is a tiny two shoulder's width stall. She said fine and walked away. Shortly after her departure my audio goes out, and I hear the sound of a cat meowing angirly into a microphone blare out of my speaker. This is followed by a series of animal noises and a slew of additional videos including such gems as ""Top 3 Minecraft songs"" and ""3 hours of farting."" Sure enough, she'd stolen my phone. I got out of the shower when she started blasting victory royal fanfare and when she saw me she started dabbing furiously and ran away. This behavior continued for at least ten more minutes before I was finally able to get my phone back.

EDIT: First time using reddit, color me impressed. I did not expect this to get nearly the attention that it did and thanks very much to the lovely people who gave me the silvers and the gold! This is not an isolated incident, if my wife finds that I've left my phone unattended while she suspects my headphones are in she will steal it and my music will be instantly cut off and replaced. Her go-to video is '3 Hours of Farting' and her stated goal is to one day have me make it through the entire video in this manner. I am extremely aware that she is an absolute gem of a woman and I'm very grateful to have her in my life, thanks to those of you who've pointed that out. For those of you 
asking, shower sex was not an option. Our shower is smaller than the tiny shower stalls you'd find in the changing rooms at your local beach. We've done shower sex before, it's a miserable experience, shampoo bottles falling all over your ankles, would choose a bed every time.

AITA for refusing to pay for thousands for something my child broke?,"I live in a pretty small town, so if you don't know somebody directly, you're likely to know a person who knows them, and this is pretty much biting me in the ass right now.

My husband and I are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. About a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. Super bright, very loud, apparently VERY fragile and pretty much right out in the open. When I saw her touching it I told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. Now, I'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but I felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

A so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. Now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding I pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). I'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people I know think I'm in the wrong here. I personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. I also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, I think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them.

"A licensed landscaper and arborist, that I did not hire, came into my front yard and took it upon himself to cut majority of the lower limbs off of my 15 year old Silver Dollar Eucalyptus Tree. Is this destruction to property? Is this trespassing? I'm in Louisiana.","When I came home from picking my kids up from school yesterday, my 7 year old daughter (If that gives any clue to how drastically he changed it) asked me ""where all the branches on our tree went?"".  When I looked at what once was a beautiful, full, weepy eucalyptus tree, there stood a wimpy, frail and freshly butchered tree.  I was in disbelief.  I work from home, so earlier that morning I heard my neighbors landscaper cutting their grass.  He has been cutting their grass as long as I have rented the house which is going on 5 years now.  I immediately thought of him, so I walked next door to the elderly couples house and asked if they thought their yard guy would take it upon himself to groom my tree.  They both said no way, but they had cameras and would certainly look into it.  Yesterday evening my neighbor came over to tell me it was her landscaper.  The cameras didn't catch it, but she asked him, and he said he did it ""because the branches were hitting him in the face when he passed by on the mower"" and ""he did us a favor"".  I was floored.  She apologized and said she couldn't believe he took as much off as he did.   The limbs he cut were at the base of the trunk, well into my yard.   He cut limbs that have taken years to grow.  He cut limbs that were not even pointing in the direction of my neighbors yard.  He made 17 cuts that I can count!

My landlord lives in Honduras, so we have very minimal contact.  When I signed the lease I took over all yard upkeep.  I have maintained all of the trees and flower beds, as well as the yard.  I have been the one to groom the trees.

Dumb Prank went too far (Ohio),"Asking for my little sister, who isn't on reddit:

My sister was the victim of a dumb prank that went too far. Some of her buddies watched the movie *Scream*. They got one of those spooky masks and went to our house when she was home alone. One of them tapped on the window, and another rattled the door knobs. My sister didn't know who they were, so she locked herself in a room and called 911.

Anyway, the guys were still there when the police got there, and they ended up being charged with ""Aggravated Menacing"" and since one of them had a real knife, there was an accelerated charge for that. Also, because my sister was 16 and all the guys were 18, it was considered child abuse?? 

My sister didn't want to press charges once she realized it was just her friends, but a magistrate (?) is pressing charges now. She doesn't want to testify, but they are making her. Even worse, this wound up on local social media, and she is being accused of ""ruining their lives"" and getting harassment for that. What should she do? ",legaladvice

Suicidal best friend checked herself into a facility while she recovers. She requested I take care of her children (1m 3f). Her family took them instead against her wishes. (UT),"My best friend is a single mom. The other day she had a mental breakdown and became suicidal. She has made an attempt on her life in the past years and years ago and knew if she didn't get help immediately, she would kill herself, and so she went directly to the emergency room. She has been moved to a behavioral health unit while she recovers mentally and is ready to go home.

She has requested that I take care of her children while she is gone. We are very close and her children love me. She trusts me completely with them. We have plans to move in together in soon. I am not a parent, but I have the means to take care of them and they would be happy.

I received an unnanounced visit from some of her family members (grandmother and cousin). They wanted to watch the children for a little bit. I was fine with this as I wanted to visit my friend to see how she was doing and stock up on food and supplies for the children. My friend was very upset that I let her cousin watch her children and requested I pick them up as soon as possible. She has always had difficulty with trusting her family and didn't want her cousin parenting her children.

Her family doesn't want to return the children to me. They claim they are worried about child protective services stepping in. They believe/claim if the children are found in custody of a friend rather than family member that the children would be taken as custody of the state.

What can I do in this case? Her children are in no way neglected and would be completely safe and cared for by me. I have taken time off work and will be with them 24/7. She even wants the children to be with me and not them. Does her will not matter to CPS? Would they actually take the children if found in care from a non family member? Or would I be completely fine caring for her children?

**Edit: I have received a lot of great advice. Thank you! I will be going to get the children asap. Many of you suggested getting the delegation of parental authority completed. I can attempt to do so but she is only allowed an hour of visitation per day. She also has no idea what is currently happening with her children and with her mental state I am worried of giving her extra stress knowing that I am having difficulty getting them back. Should I continue to have difficulty, I will have to get her to help with getting the documents signed. I would like to keep this as peaceful with her family as possible, which it has been so far. I understand their concern about CPS and I'm hoping that the advice I receive will help convince them that they have no need to be worried and CPS won'tbe an issue. Should I show them my home and that I am 100% capable of caring for the children to alleviate their concerns?**

**Edit 2: I have the children back. I talked with their mother on the phone and she assured me CPS was a non-issue. She even insured that her family were not listed as caregivers, and another close friend of hers is. Her friend is with me in this and believes I am fully fit to have them. Still facing a lot of opposition towards me having them and I'm working through getting the proper paperwork signed.**

**Edit 3: Thread has been locked but I have received plenty of helpful advice. Thank you for all of your well wishes. I have pumped up an air mattress for them as all the beds in my home are really tall, and they love it. The 3 year old calls it her balloon bed. I also found pillows that look like eyeballs and they think it'sthe coolest thing their bed has eyes. I am so happy to have them and relieved that they will be safe with me as we wait for their mother to return home.**",legaladvice
TIFU for thinking of moving home because of a noise that was making me crazy,"a few months ago I was lying in bed about to fall asleep, when I start to hear a noise that seems to come from upstairs.

the noise was like a bouncing ball falling. the ball began to fall from very high and the noise intensified as it began to approach the ground. then stop. and would come back again.

the sound was soft but very close.

I am someone who sleeps anywhere, anytime, in any position. I'm like chuck norris falling asleep but this was crazy. a sleep deprivation torture.

the sound continued for another 30 minutes and stopped. there were days when it kept going for an hour straight. days when nothing just happened. sometimes I heard it during the day which was almost equally horrible because I couldn't concentrate if I was reading or watching a movie. but he appeared mostly at bedtime.

this went on for over a month.

one night I was very tired and decided to go to bed early (9pm).

and of course there was that motherfucker again.

I did not think. I got out of bed, opened the apartment door and climbed the stairs to my upstairs neighbors.

so there I was. no bra. wearing a t-shirt with prehistoric spots. some pants with three sizes over mine. and with the classic trousers inside the socks for extra heat. with hair where any bird would proudly wear as a nest. and of course knee socks of different colors and sizes because everyone has a black hole sucking socks inside the washing machine. at this point in my decaying life, I didn't even bother to put my shoes on.

so there I was, climbing the stairs with nothing planned to say.

as I approached the door I could hear a lot of noise in their house. I ring the bell and a girl opens the door. everyone in that house came to see what was going on. they were all very well dressed, as if they had come from a wedding or something and visibly lightly drunk.

so there I was in the hallway explaining to a group of fancy drunk people that there is a noise ""like a falling bouncing ball"" coming from that apartment.

she tells me she has housemates but the room above mine is empty.

I still say that it is impossible. that the noise comes almost every day and it's been a month and I'm starting to go crazy.

she says she doesn't know where the noise might come from. There is nothing at home that can make a sound that I tried to mimic.

yes, I imitated a bouncy ball with different voices for a group of fancy drunk people.

so there I was, thinking as we talked that none of this was going to get resolved and most likely would have to move house until I say, without much thought, ""wanna go see it?""

so there we were, me and 8 other fancy drunk people in my small room quietly waiting for the noise to appear.

and of course, nothing happened.

I apologized to everyone, I took the fancy drunk people to the door and went to bed to spoon with my shame and retardness.

this was last week.

today a friend came here for the afternoon. while we were talking the wild noise appeared. I was hysterical.

""ARE YOU HEARING THIS""

""yea...""

""I can no longer with this noise, I think I'll have to move house.""

""it comes from your warmer ...""

so my heater has two buttons. one to turn it on and one to change the temperature. and it seems that when the heater is off and the temperature button is in heat mode, it makes a weird noise that looks like a bouncing ball and the echo of the house sounds like it comes from upstairs.

"TIFU I hooked up with a guy in my airport hotel room this morning before checking out. Turns out he is on the same flight as me and guess what, he's traveling with his wife and kids.","I know Reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. This morning I was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. So I got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. So I said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. After 45min to an hour of fun, I thought I'd never see this dude again because I'm flying home this afternoon (right now).

Wrong. I went to the gate when they started boarding. Guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? You guessed it. To make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and I can hear all their conversations. I'm in the plane right now and he keeps texting. I am saving screen shots in case I need them in the future. I'm sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

This is so uncomfortable.

TL;DR: Hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. Turns out he's married, and he and his family are on my flight home.

Edit: I gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. He texted me just now telling me he found me on IG and FB so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. Now I definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.

Edit 2: A) I'm male. B) The wife does not know. He texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. And then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet I saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) C) I knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies

AITA for ghosting at parties?,"The other day I was at a BBQ and was talking with everyone when a friend says to me ""I have a bone to pick with you"". I was a little shocked because I like to think I'm nice enough and get along with people, but I was keen to find out what her issue was with me.


""You don't say good-bye, you just leave"" is what she said, and it's true. I prefer to just leave a party and let everyone keep going. I do it because if I announce I am leaving then people often ask me to stay or ask why I'm leaving, sometimes it makes other people think ""yeah I might go too"" ending the party earlier. I prefer to just disappear. 


Anyway I explained myself to this friend and she said ""no it's super rude"". We're Australian so I told her to go fuck herself and we both laughed. After that BBQ I made a point of saying goodbye to her directly, but I still prefer to ghost. My wife isn't a fan of me doing this but she has long since accepted it.


tl;dr - I like to leave parties without saying goodbye to most people (please read the edits, I do thank the host and I now know it's an Irish goodbye). Am I the asshole?

AITA For wanting to cut my best friend out of my life for stealing my baby name?,"
To start things off, I'm not pregnant. Nor am I anywhere near close to being pregnant. However, my best friend is pregnant and I couldn't be more happy for her. As best friends do, we started discussing baby names. She asked me if I had any baby names picked out for my future children and I told her my mother had suggested a name years ago for my future daughter that I absolutely fell in love with. It's super unique and it's a name that originates from the country she was born in. My mother is no longer alive, so this is something I really wanted to do in the future so my potential daughter could have a connection to her grandmother. 
A few days ago, I saw on facebook that my best friend posted a picture of those 3D sonograms and in the post she revealed the name that she had picked for her daughter. It was the name I told her that I had picked out for my future daughter. I am absolutely devastated she would do this to me. She knows what that name meant to me and she decided to use it anyway. She says it's just a name and since she's pregnant before me she gets to use whatever name she wants. I told her she's being heartless and asked her how she can do this to someone she sees as a sister. She is not going to change her mind about this, so I want to end all communication with her since I can't even imagine calling her daughter by the name I wanted for mine. Am I the asshole for doing this?

*Just some more information: This isn't an American/English name, it's a Middle Eastern one. She isn't Middle Eastern.

I met with Jake a day later.  I wanted extra time to think.  He initially acted really lovey dovey when we met up and told me that Timmy was making me a giant ""welcome home"" sign for when I came back.  I said we needed to talk first.

I basically had written down an estimated numbers of hours I was providing active care for Timmy in the past few months, versus him.  Then how many hours of care he was predicting we each provide, which was 4 of his hours compared to 50 of mine.  I said that I hadn't had time to persue hobbies, go to the gym, etc in the last few months.  And also that we hadn't done anything as a couple.  I said for me to come back, he had to change all that.

He answered with his own list of stuff.  Which was confusing, like his mom wants me to raise Timmy's grades more as he struggles with reading, and he thinks that we should enroll him in a club.  I was upset because it was all stuff I'd have to do additionally to my workload.  I said I wouldn't, he said I'd come around.

Then he said that I had put him in a bind for childcare the last two days, and asked if I would come and watch Timmy for him anyway.  I said I would help for a few days if we have a sit down and he tell Timmy that I'm not untrustworthy, as he had told the boy earlier.  He refused, saying that I proved I was untrustworthy by threatening to break up.  Then he asked if I would at least chaperone him to a birthday party that's coming up at a bounce-trampoline place.  I said absolutely not, that I was undermined authority and that was awful in a place that dangerous.

He left.

My friends went with me to get my stuff yesterday.  I've been a mess, but friends are convincing me to go out with them a few places next week and I might take up dance classes again starting February.

Thank you all for showing me I wasn't completely offbase

TIFU by going on my first date in years,"So usual disclaimer, this happened last week not today but I've only just recovered enough to talk about it. 

Also for context I am a detective with the police which was on my profile.

So I have been single a few months now and finally decided to give those tinder style apps a go. I was recommended Bumble by a colleague which is essentially just tinder but bee themed.

I downloaded the app Thursday and by Friday I had a date so I thought things were going well. First date I arrange for Saturday at a busy shopping centre.

Now I've been out of the dating game for a while and we were chatting about movies so we went to go to the cinema to see Mortal Engines.

I knew the first greeting was always going to be awkward, the whole ""hey is that x? 《YOU NOW HAVE 1 SECOND TO DECIDE ON KISS ON CHEEK, AWKWARD HUG OR LAME WAVE THING》 but what happened was none of those things. Instead I get hit with "" TELL ME WHO YOU ARE I NEED TO VERIFY YOU"" which not going to lie is as romantic a greeting as smearing yourself with marmite and announcing ""let's have a toast for the pretty lady!""

Anyway she then asks ""WHAT'S THAT ON THE FLOOR"" pointing to a large pile of dust. It's a pile of dust I tell her and she makes me double check.

Dust confirmed we move on to the cinema and purchase tickets the announcer in my brain exclaimes 《YOU ARE NOW LOCKED INTO THE DATE》

We got an hour and a half till the movie so we grab some ice cream cause that's cute as shit and head to Starbucks (which fyi is a crowded mutherflucker) grab a table and she leans close... zero chill just dead pan asks me ""...what's the darkest job you have ever dealt with..."" 

Now I've got some H.P. Lovecraft dark stories so I try to give her a PG version of a double murder I had some involvement with. (Note: everything I discussed could also be easily read about online)

""HOW DID HE KILL THEM? WAS THERE A LOT OF BLOOD? DID YOU SEE IT? WAS IT LIKE THE MOVIES? I LOVE MURDER STORIES, HAVE YOU SEEN MAKING A MURDERER? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT X MURDER? DID YOU KNOW THIS ONE GUY ONCE CHOPPED HIS MUM'S HEAD OFF AND HAD SEX WITH THE CORPSE ISN'T THAT FACINATING?!?!""

(Let me just remind you it's as crowded as balls in leather pants in this coffee shop and people are looking over)

She also hits me with a few probing questions ""Have you ever committed a crime? Have you ever done drugs?!""

Trying to recover some semblance of a date I joke ""haha only if you count downloading showbox as a crime""

Next it's my turn to ask some questions and throw out the classic ""Tell me about your self"" (I know it's lame but I panicked)

""Oh I've just been released from 18 months locked up in a psyche ward in Broadmoor, it was pretty much a doss and I got to meet people like naked Phillip""

Now gripped with what can only be described as the terror a double D breasted woman feels in a slasher flick I decide I have two choices.

1) Run into the crowd and disappear

2) continue date (what could go wrong in a cinema? It's just 2 hours of awkward silence)

Let's just say I chose poorly...

Before we move off though she asks me to search her chair... I don't really do much except say it's fine but after walking off she decides my efforts were not good enough and goes back to search it properly.

Finally into the cinema now 10 minutes after start time so it's adverts but most people have sat down... of course there are people in our seat, what looks like a family of 14 parts like the Red Sea so we can sit in the seats we paid for but they are somewhat miffed.

Suddenly my date whips out the flashlight on her phone and starts search the chair! The woman from the family is also some nutbar and starts yelling ""MY EYES! TURN OFF THAT LIGHT!! ARRGHHFYFBIFWYH""

my date sits down in darkness for a whole 5 minutes before deciding that she wants to have a round two of flashlight rodeo.... cue raging snickers lady ""I'M GOING TO KNOCK YOU OUT I TOLD YOU TURN THAT LIGHT OFF"" 

I'm not about to white knight defend this woman, I'm a god damn spectator here! The fruit and nut villain is eventually calmed down by her fella.

Date goes for lucky number 3 flashlight gamble, this time I have to step in and say thus is not ok.

So movie time. I'm sure Mortal Engines is a fine film... but it's pretty out there and loooong. All I'm thinking about is the 3 pieces of advice I was given prior to app dating

1) don't get drunk
2) don't send dick pics
3) don't stick your dick in crazy 

So despite the horror movie Mortal Engines has become I am still a man and she is still an attractive woman so I'm repeating number 3) again and again in my head like a monk trying to achieve enlightenment. Lucky the date is so bad and my fear so palpable that logic wins out.

After the movie she goes to the bathroom and hands me her coat and bag, can't run yet... got to wait...

She returns dead serious ""I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW ME""

this is where I die i think, I'm being lured to the bathroom to be filleted like a fish and used as a skin suit in some crazy sex game.

She walks me to an isolated area and points at an especially large pile of dust

""WHAT'S THAT?""

I say just a large pile of dust ""ARE YOU SURE, CAN YOU CHECK"" 

Sure enough it's just dust...

So keen to make good my escape I lay down a ""woah look at the time... 8:30! Got to grab that train"" she responds ""you know I'm really thirsty... could really go for a drink!""

Not willing to be the 3rd party to a human centipede I push on ""central line that's Me! Oh you too? Great..."" 

Next she smashes out a ""you know the Overground train for me is an hour wait.... I don't really want to wait an hour... so thirsty..."" 

The next stop I just decided the wrong station was the right place to be, ""oh look at This! Haha my stop lovely to meet you BYE"" 

The journey home was the most paranoia driven thriller of my 29 years...

AITA: For shaming people who blast music in public?,"I hate when people blare music in public, even if it's music I like. I really don't understand why idiots have to loudly play music in front of everyone. I see these people almost daily on my commute on mass transit and it's been annoying the hell outta me. It's one thing to be listening to loud music in your earbuds, it's another blaring Fetty Wap from a portable speaker on a bus. 


Lately, I've been making a point to carry around a couple crappy earbuds.

There were better female-empowering shows and movies 20 years ago than there are today.,"This came up while discussing movies with my sister. I asked if she finds it cool that so many women are now getting important roles in the entertainment industry. She said something like ""I'm not sure if they got the roles cuz they're good AND female or just because of the latter"" and it really opened my eyes. 

The current female-centric reboots are mostly flopping (things like Wonder Woman being exceptions). I found Terminator, Power Rangers, Castle, etc. way cooler when they made them EQUALS with men and not simply trash them. Also, wasn't it more inspiring when women made it big back then? I remember when the chess player Judith Polgar became famous and was right up there with the men. Now, with a separate Chess league for women, nobody really cares about it. But I'm digressing.

Power Rangers vs the new Ghostbusters is my point. Females were part of the original PR team in almost equal numbers. They usually wore pink and such feminine colour but equally kicked butts in battles. That. Was. Awesome. The new Ghostbusters isn't. 

Now I'm just not sure that if a woman wins an award that was usually male-dominated, was the reason really merit? Twenty-years ago, it surely would have been.

EDIT: To answer so many questions on the existence of separate chess leagues for men and women, yes, I'm not making this up. Women can, if they want, compete and get ranked along with the men but almost nobody does this because of the huge rating difference. Although this was challenged by Judit and now by Hou, when she boycotted a tournament as she wasn't getting any male opponents despite her wanting to compete with men.",unpopularopinion

"Apartment complex installed ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment without my consent, is asking me to sign a lease addendum consenting to personal data collection and agreeing to be financially responsible for maintenance and upkeep of said devices. What are my options? [Colorado]","I got a notice via email a while back that the Apartment complex where I live in Denver was going to be installing ""SmartHome"" devices in my apartment. I didn't respond because I assumed I would have to consent in order for them to do anything.  I was wrong, and they replaced my door lock, thermostat, plugs and switches, water sensor, etc. while I was traveling for work. 

Now they want me (and every other tenant) to sign an addendum to our leases saying I requested this and asking that I consent to data collection and that if anything goes wrong with the devices that they put in, I am responsible to pay $250 to fix any damage or maintenance to repair or replace them if I do not notify the building within 5 days of malfunction.

Some of the language in the addendum makes me very uneasy.

 `""You have requested that we provide [Insert Name of SmartDevice Vendor] in your unit. We agree to do so and you agree to pay additional rent in the amount of $0.00 per month""`  

I did not request this.

`""Information collected by [Insert Name of SmartDevice Venor] (""Information""): We have listed information collected by each device we supply, some of which may be considered ""Personal Information,"" depending on your jurisdiction:""""1. Front Door Lock:- Entry activity by time and code used- Technical information from device, including, but not limited to, battery level and lock status""`

This language is pretty much the same for Thermostat, SmartPlugs and Switches, Hub, Water Sensor and software to use it all.

`""Information Sharing: Anonymized and aggregated information collected by the Service may be shared with third parties for energy benchmarking, quality of service determinations, and for research and product development. Recipients of this information may include, but are not limited to, equipment manufacturers, consultants, educational institutions, utilities, study sponsors and government agencies""`

Additionally, there is language that specifies that the devices are owned by the property and if I lose or damage any of them, I am subject to a $250 fine. 

`""If a device has been damaged or appears to be malfunctioning, you are required to notify us within five (5) days.""`

What are my options? I really like my apartment and don't want to leave, but I also don't want to consent to sharing personal information re: entering/exiting my apartment with anyone, even if it is anonymized and aggregated and certainly don't want to be on the hook financially for malfunctioning products that I did not want or consent to being installed.

[Update] They removed all the cats from my mom's house.,"Animal control and the police were called, and it took them until today to get here. Over the weekend I took my mother to a hotel, and she said she was happy that I cleaned up for some mother-daughter time. She also thanked me for getting her a new bed. She couldn't comprehend that we weren't in her house. 

 Animal control, with a lot of help confiscated all the cats except two, and all of the birds. For those debating it, no it was not a swan, but a young duck. I should probably have known, but I wasn't going to take a second peek into that room. The total cat count was 213, and the total bird count was 87. There were a significant amount more that were, unfortunately, dead. Many of the cats were sick, and may have to be euthanized.

My mother is extremely upset, she has been admitted to the hospital for reasons I would rather not get into. I don't know if the house is saveable, the situation is still being assessed. I'm sorry it's not a happy update, but at least I'm no longer drowning in cats.",legaladvice

"[MI, USA] Considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now I have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear","I have a big family, with around 20 cousins,  10 aunts and uncles, and several others who always show up to family  reunions. I'm a male in my 20s.

Last weekend we had a family reunion in a cabin resort in the woods. On the last night there, while everyone was sitting by the campfire, my uncle (by marriage), snuck up behind me and blasted an air horn about a foot  or two away from the back of my head. This air horn was not a normal little one you often see at sporting events. This campground has bear  around, so they keep several large air horns around the place to be used to scare off a bear in case they get too close.

As soon as he did it, everyone called him an asshole and got angry at him. He showed no remorse whatsoever. He laughed about it, telling us how he and his friends from work have blown air horns at each other before as a prank.

I was so furious when it happened that I didn't know what to do. I sat there quietly stewing in my rage for a while. I wanted to beat the shit out of him or hold him down while I emptied half of the air horn directly into his ear. But instead I  walked away eventually and spent the rest of the night in my room. It's important to know that this uncle was hosting this reunion. It's a ""corporate retreat campground"" that his company lets employees use.

He clearly knew he fucked up because he attempted to apologize the next day, but it was a pretty shitty apology. While everyone was sitting down for breakfast, he snuck up behind me, put his arms on my shoulders and quietly said, ""I heard your ears were ringing. Sorry about that."" He didn't even say it to my face, or say it loud enough for anyone else to hear. I grumbled something about ""it's okay,"" but I absolutely do not forgive him.

This happened last Saturday, a week ago. For the first couple days my ears were literally sore, and any loud noises were painful to hear. Since then, my ears have been constantly ringing. It's the worst when I'm in a quiet environment, like  trying to work or go to sleep. I hear this high pitched sound that is driving me nuts. Sometimes it'll start to subside, but it still comes and goes. I think I could have permanent hearing damage.

This  guy has been giving me shit since I was a young kid, so this was not a one time occurrence, though this was definitely the worst thing he's done to me by far. I've contacted a personal injury lawyer in my area to learn about my options, but I figured some people here might have good info as well. I won't hear back from the lawyer until tomorrow at the earliest. Any info is appreciated. Suing my uncle would tear a huge hole in my family, but I really don't care about that if I end up having a ringing in my ear for the rest of my life. It's interfering with my ability to sleep and work. Thanks for any help.

[UPDATE] I(28m) wrongly accused my girlfriend (24F) of cheating. I don't know where to go from here.,"So, my last post (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw31od/i_28m_wrongly_accused_my_gf_24f_of_cheating_dont/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) got a lot of responses and I decided to do a prompt update as a lot has changed in just the last day and I wanted to update anyone who was interested and/or concerned for my girlfriend. 

I read your responses and decided to make a big apology to my girlfriend for how I behaved. However, before I got chance, she arrived at the house. 
I'll hold my hands up and say that this isn't the first time I've jumped to conclusions and pretty much since we got together, I've had a habit of winding myself up and then checking her phone/accounts. I know it's wrong, but I always felt if I found something I'd be justified which is so messed up, I know. 

My ex did cheat on me. Well, she had an affair and left me for the other dude. I guess I projected this onto my current girlfriend. My girlfriend never, ever has given me any reason to doubt her and treats me better than I've ever been treated before. She's down to earth, honest, open, funny, kind, beautiful and she gives me to opportunity to share my thoughts and feelings with no judgement. 

I don't know why I assumed the worst of her, I really don't. 
To answer a common question - she has online banking app on her phone and it's the same passcode as her mobile so I could log on. Super super fucked up, I know. 

When she arrived at the house, she was calm but sad. She explained that she knew I'd always check her phone and that I'd be ""off"" with her anytime she went out with friends but that she always hoped over time, if she proved herself, I'd let go. When she found out that I'd done what I did, it hurt even more because she was trying to do something nice for me. 
She told me she loves me but she finds herself justifying every activity she does, over explaining herself and told me she has real, genuine anxiety whenever she's out with friends because she knows I'll be sat at home imagining scenarios of where she could be. She found herself withdrawing from friends. 

She told me we were over. Not because she doesn't love me, because she can't devote her life to someone who only sees the worst in her. She told me that I could have just spoke to her and she'd be honest but that she knows even if she did, I wouldn't believe her unless I could prove it and she's probably right. I don't know why, but I know in myself I would not fully believe her because I mean, of course she'd say that, right? Anyway... She left me. Packed up her things and went. 

I know her, she's a strong minded woman. It really is over and I've never felt worse. But she's right, I'm not ready to trust someone yet and even in our last moments, she gave me the confidence and motivation to get help and be better, even if she won't be there to see the change. I know she loves me and that fact alone makes it worth changing myself. 

I'm not going to try and win her back, because I can't promise I won't do it again. I'm heartbroken and hurt but she verbalised it in such a way, it really hit home. She calmly explained it to me in a way that only showed me her true love for me. 

I'm just so sorry for hurting her, I guess. 

But, thank you all for sharing your opinions and giving me some home truths. I appreciate it more than you know. 

This is it for now, hopefully this time next year I'll be a new man and be able to treat the next woman who loves me, the way my ex girlfriend deserved to be treated.

My [45M] Wife [42F] revealed she was unfaithful and I'm divorcing her. Our children [15F & 17M] hate me for it.,"Edit: Guys, I appreciate the advice. But I'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. I've made my decision, and it's not something I'm willing to forgive. I'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

My wife and I have been together for 18 years. We had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. We've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

About two weeks ago I brought up an advice column in the paper I had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and I could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so I asked her what was bothering her. She confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. This was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. She says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. Claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. We talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. I realized I knew I'd never be able to let this go, nor would I be able to forgive her. She's distraught.

We sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. Obviously this was extremely tough. They acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. My wife and I agreed to tell them it was mutual, but I guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. This had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. My wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. I don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so I'm being trying to explain as tactfully as I can, but they're gone as far as saying that when I get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that I still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. My wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since I've told her of my plan to leave.

I love my kids, but I don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. I don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that I'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. I just know that I cannot get past this, and for my own happiness I need to leave. Any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

TIFU by telling my son's new doctor we are Anti-Vaxx,"Obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

My son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. We decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. I brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

Toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""Well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which I reply, ""Oh, no he can't have that, I don't want him to get autism.""

I should maybe note here that I am an aspie too, and while I think my sarcasm is on point, I must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. The silence lasted an eternity while I imagine she was deciding how to proceed. Eventually I laughed and tried to assure her I was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

As my son and I were discussing whether I was offensive (he thought I was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. He started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. He just kept saying, ""Okay, well I have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

Tl;dr: Jokingly told my son's new doctor that I didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

Edit: Of course we took the gardasil. Shout out to nurse Pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. I wish everyone could have a nurse Pete. Also, since I'm editing, thanks for the awards!",tifu
AITA for saying in class that I don't care that my bully classmate is dead?,"I (17M) was horrendously bullied by this guy, we can call Jake (17M). Jake was quite popular and sociable but for some reason kept targeting me, calling me names, slurs, etc. I hated him so much, I'd hate going to school and him being in class. I dreaded it.

Well we found out that Jake unexpectedly passed away in his sleep. When I saw this on Facebook, I saw lots of RIP posts from classmates, but my first reaction was relief. I felt a weight lift off my shoulders.

When I came to class, people were crying and my teacher (50F) said we need to take a moment silence for him. After the silence was done, I just said out loud ''I don't care that Jake died. He was a bully''. People looked at me instantly and gave me death stares, I could hear some people muttering swear words.

But then some people came up to me and thanked me, they said they hated Jake too. Honestly I'm fucking glad he's dead. I feel so much better about my life now. Some classmates called me AH, his girlfriend (ex now lol) came up to me and called me every name under the sun, AH was one of them. I just said to her ''You need to calm down and relax'' and walked away. 

I honestly feel good and so do some other classmates. AITA?

Holy fuck I can't believe i'm writing this.

My [31F] boyfriend [34M] broke up with me sort of because I asked if I was invited to his sister's wedding,"So, this might be a long read. I am not using a throwaway because I don't care.

My boyfriend and I have had an interesting relationship. I would say the main thing that has divided us has been that his family is kinda racist Southerners and I am a mixed race person. He assured me that this wouldn't be an issue when I met his family. Hint: it was.

I'm not going to go into detail about the way they treated me, specifically his mother and sister, but it was not pleasant. His sister and I had met previously and I thought we were cool - until I met his mother. His mother and sister ganged up on me and were very mean with that uniquely acquired Southern Charm (y'all from the South know exactly what I am talking about). Basically I ended up getting wasted and telling them they were extremely rude and said something along the lines of, ""Y'all want to be Southern Belles, but you're disguised White Trash."" Umm... oops. I was so drunk that night that they called the police and I ended up in the hospital to sober up. Go me. Definitely not my proudest moment.

Anyway, fast forward to a year later, his sister is getting married. His sister and I are cool again like when we first met. K. I asked my boyfriend last night if I was invited to the wedding. He said no because of the way I treated his family. I said, ""Wait, you mean because of the way your family treated me?"" And this escalated into an argument about how I disrespected his family and he refuses to understand that I don't exactly appreciate being talked down to by his family. He then said, ""Let's face it, you were never going to be invited to the wedding in the first place. Our relationship was never going to be a long-term thing."" Okay, well, there's a lot to unpack there, including when I helped his sister pick out wedding dresses and we talked about cakes and stuff like that. Maybe she was just being polite.

But... we have also been together for more than a year and a half and live in a house (that he owns) together? There was a little bit more to this. He said, ""We have a great partnership. You're really good at cooking and cleaning and taking care of the house..."" Okay, what. I didn't realize that I was your housemaid (to save our viewers from the words that I am really thinking).

Then, this morning, he's acting like nothing ever happened.

(Texas) Power of attorney seems fishy?,"So, I'm 29 and my parents don't allow me to get a job or move out on my own and every time I try to, they threaten me with this. I do have mental disabilities, however I am fully functional and I also have never been diagnosed. This leads me to questioning the veracity of my parent's threats. I do remember my parents dragging me into an SSA office when I was younger and they made me sign some document without me reading it. They just told me to sign it without question and being my parents I didn't think to question them. Later they told me that I had signed away my rights (their phrasing) and that they now have power over me. Every time I try to run away they also threaten to call the cops and they tell me that since I'm disabled and I have no guardianship over myself, whoever I go to can be charged with kidnapping since my parents didn't consent. I'm also not allowed to have friends or anything because they use this to dictate my every move. They tell me I'm crazy and helpless and I can't be trusted and that's why for my own good they got this thing.

Other things that might be important that make my question things:

They don't care about my well being. They don't allow me to go to therapy even when I've asked. They refuse to allow me to see a doctor and when I finally did, they threw away my medication because they claim it was bad for me. I know for sure I do have a mental disability, I just don't know what and once again, they've never took me to get diagnosed let alone therapy. They've always been controlling and I wonder if this is just another method. I get too scared to call Suicide Hotline when I'm depressed because they had me convinced for the longest time that, quote, ""they'll lock you up in a mental asylum for life and take away your phone and never let you talk to the people you love ever again and they'll treat you like you're crazy."" I've since learned this is obviously not true, but it's ingrained in me now and I have a hard time seeking help. I feel that this is also yet another form of control.

&#x200B;

Anyways, how do I go about verifying if they really do have this thing over me? What are their rights if this is true? What are my rights? Can I, I guess appeal (not sure if this is the right word)? What can I do about this?

&#x200B;

Is there any other legal advice y'all can offer that I haven't thought about asking for? Can I do anything about how controlling my parents are, legally speaking? Can they really deny me therapy and medical care?

&#x200B;

I should also I add they sabotage any jobs I try to work because of the POA thing. I currently help my mother around the store they own and they pay me randomly and I'm not on any official payroll that I know of. Is this also legal????

My daughter was bit by a raccoon with rabies. My wife does not want to give our daughter the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am taking her tonight to a hospital against my wifes wishes in secret.,"My daughter was playing with a wild raccoon last night and got bit. I killed a raccoon in the area foaming at the mouth. Not sure if its the same one but refuse to take the chance. 

My wife vehemently refused the rabies series because its a vaccine. I am in panic mode and I am taking her to a hospital over 50 miles away near Dallas. 

Can I kidnap my own daughter? There is not a custody agreement in place because we are married and not separated. Probably will be soon though. 

I need to know what to watch out for here and what to say to police if I get stopped. Rabies is fatal so I am not playing with this one. 

I am leaving here in 10 minutes so just need to know a few things. 

Is it kidnapping in this case?

Will I be arrested? 

What do I do if she calls in an amber alert?

I am desperate.",legaladvice

TIFU by leaving my dragon dildos out to dry [NSFW],"This is literally still happening. Maybe it will continue for the rest of my life. Maybe this is it for me.

So I live in an apartment-style dorm, but my roommates do not move in for a few more weeks so I am alone in my unit for now. This is very clear because there is a placard with my name and my name only on the front door.

This morning I woke up to the sounds of clanging and walking in my unit. I panicked before my mind supplied ""oh that's the janitor that comes to clean the bathrooms on Monday's"". 

And I immediately suffer a heart attack.

It is Wednesday. 

I was not expecting a janitor visit. 

In the tub, drying overnight, I had arranged a smorgasbord of sex toy delights: anal beads, a plug, and four dragon/monster dildos of increasing size. Lined up. Like little sex soldiers.

I hear her open the door to the bathroom, and I lay in the bed in my locked room quiet and still. Maybe I'll can stop existing.

I hear some noise, and what sounds like talking.

A few minutes later I hear my RA walk in. I hear some comments and some laughter. They quietly convene for what feels like a long while. The RA simply laments ""why?!"" and the  janitor asks if any boys live in the unit. I continue not to breathe. There are four bedrooms and they don't know which one I use and all the doors are closed so if I continue to be quiet I can astral project off this plane of existence without them noticing.

I currently hear the sounds of a spray bottle, occasionally followed by bag rustling and the tell-tale sound of unsticking a six pound hunk of silicon from a tub. I don't know when she'll leave, if ever. I think I'll be trapped here forever, sweating under the covers from anticipation and embarrassment while she talks and laughs and cleans around my monster dildos.

Please send me instructions on how to dissolve into the floor, thanks and have a lovely afternoon.

TL;DR: Left all my sex toys out overnight so of course the janitor made a surprise visit this morning and invited the RA to come look at my dragon cocks.

-- / -- / -- / -- / --

UPDATE: Oh my god this absolutely blew up. I'm going to give an update and answer some questions because I think my phone is going to explode.

-- I emerged from my room about an hour later, my toys were as I left them and there was cleaner in the toilet, so my understanding is that the janitor cleaned the bathroom and perhaps lifted the toys to clean underneath them. I rinsed my things and put them hidden in a drawer in my room. I was waiting to update because I half-expected some communication from my RA but this hasn't happened. Sorry the ending isn't juicier but honestly I wouldn't have been able to handle it so I'm thankful.

-- The janitor coming in unannounced is standard procedure. I still have no clue why the RA was allowed in; I'm starting to believe maybe it was, in fact, another janitor? The voice was hushed and I may have misidentified it.

-- A lot of you want pics of the toys. I have a pic of the four in question in a post I made a month or so ago. Yes I recommend them, yes they are worth the money.

-- I am FTM, so I am a guy but I currently still have my vagina. I didn't mention my sex or gender because for many reasons it was irrelevant to the story. I put the toys wherever I decide I want them. This clarification is here so that discussion and speculation in the comments is no longer necessary. Comments about this aren't going to spark fun or interesting conversations so if you want to argue go do it on a debate forum, not on a funny dildo story.

-- I don't know anything about game of thrones and at this point I'm too afraid to ask

Thanks for the awards and funny stories from you all, hope you have a good day and are never cursed with an inbox that looks like mine does eight now. Glad my suffering could bring you some entertainment on this rainy Wednesday, godspeed to you all.",tifu

[GA] Got a VERY bad haircut at a well known salon. As my hair is directly tied to my income is it worth it to contact a lawyer?,"Right off the bat, I understand that other people have much bigger problems then this, and I know that hair grows back. Sorry if this post is all over the place. 

I know no one one Reddit can give me all the answers but I'm wondering if this is something worth pursuing or not. 

I also know that there are a ton of points where I should I should have said stop and asked for another stylist but I've never had a bad experience with these people and I'm kind of shy about speaking up. 

I had very long, healthy hair (down to my ass) that I've been growing out for 3+ years.  My hair is directly tied to my income, I'm a (hair) model and I'd say I'm probably looking at losing about $5-10,000 depending on what gigs I can still do with extensions (these are jobs booked specifically because of my hair up until the end of this year as well as paid social media advertisements). This isn't including income I would have made booking other gigs for the rest of the year (I made $30,000 last year in mostly jobs tied directly to my hair). 

A week ago, I went into a well known and reputable salon for a 2-3 inch TRIM. This isn't a Great Clips or Sports Clips type situation, this is a well known, expensive salon. The amount I wanted off was specified both when I made the appointment, in the notes at the front desk, and when the stylist was cutting my hair. 

I have a normal go-to stylist there but on the day of my appointment she was out sick. I was assigned a new stylist instead (I wasn't notified at the time that they were brand new to the salon and this was their first job out of school). Everything went well with the cut, but after they finished blow drying I noticed it was uneven (like a two or three inch difference). I pointed it out and they immediately apologized and went to fix it (first red flag, should have asked for someone else). At this point I was angled away from the mirror. Halfway through they went to ask the manager a question which I now realize was related to the cut and not just a general question (second red flag). I looked in the mirror and my hair was at least 5 inches off (probably more) at this point. This was probably when I really should have stopped them, but once again I had faith in the salon and five inches wasn't a huge deal because my hair was so long. When they came back I specifically asked NO shorter and just keeping it as long as possible at that point. 

I was facing the mirror and they were working on the back and I just hear her mutter ""crap"" under her breath. I immediately told her to stop and show me the back. I have NO clue for the life of me how but a large chunk of my hair was chopped to the base of my NECK. I asked to speak to a a manager and I was in tears at this point. 

The manager was really kind and explained she was new. But when I started crying she was rather rude saying ""it's JUST hair it will grow back, you don't need to be making a scene"" things along that line. I was really panicked at this point. She offered to have their senior master stylist come in to fix it the next day but I wanted nothing to do with her at that point, asked for a hair tie and left. 

The next day I went to my moms hairstylist who cut my hair when I was younger and he was shocked. He said that in his experience a salon of that caliber shouldn't have someone who would eff up that bad and he'd ask around. He also mentioned the possibility of me trying to sue that salon. I just wanted him to fix it and he did a fairly good jo by cutting my hair into a v-shape, but it would  be considered a long bob and in no way the style I have bookings for or the style that gets me jobs generally.  

Then today my moms stylist called me back (he's been doing my families hair for years and is a good friend) and said he had heard from a pretty reputable source that the stylist was the child of either the general manager or owner of that salon and wasn't qualified to work there. He said I should most definitely pursue legal action and that if this had happened in his salon the owner would already be making me offers. 

The original salon has not called me back at all, but I was fairly rude leaving. 

Question is, is this worth pursuing? I feel like any lawyer will laugh at me because it's just hair. I'm also really young and still working on my undergrad so this isn't a full time career. I just don't know what to do at this point.",legaladvice

AITA for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?,"On my gf's birthday I gave her a necklace that I spent $400 on.  I wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but I was expecting something.

AITA for making my pregnant daughter move out before the baby is born?,"My 17 yo daughter (youngest and we had her late) is 7 weeks pregnant (she will be 18 by the time she gives birth) She is not in a relationship with the father. He reeaallyyy, I can't stress this enough, does not want a baby. I honestly don't even think he'll show up for the birth or anything.

She has decided to continue with the pregnancy against all advice from practically every adult in her life. After she insisted on not only continuing with the pregnancy but raising the baby I asked her how she is going to manage that? This was the jist of the convo:

Her: I'll get a job. 
Me: who's going to watch baby while you're at work? 
Her: I thought you and dad could.
Me: absolutely not, I'm not raising another baby.

Pretty much a back and forth for a bit that lead me to believe that if she has this baby in this house, I'm practically going to be its mother. I'm very recently retired  and my husband is retiring in exactly 11 months (there's a countdown) and this is not how I want to spend my retirement years. It's not fair to us. So I told her that she has until baby is born to find a place to live. Husband has always been wrapped around her finger (which normally is endearing, I love how much he loves our children) so he is not fully on board with that but I feel like we need to be united on this. I just want to know if  I'm in the wrong here.

AITA?

Edit: to everyone acting like I'm spending the next 7 months ignoring her- I will help her get a job, get on assistance if need be, find affordable housing etc. I just will not raise this baby.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for removing all the cutlery and dishes in my shared apartment?,"I have always set a pretty basic rule for my roommates, and that is that only I can use a certain set of cutlery and dishes that has special sentimental value to me. All the other cookware, pots, pans, plates, and so on in the house belong to me, but I told them they could feel free to use all of those things rather than have to go buy their own, which would add up to a pretty large amount.

Things worked pretty well at first but over time I caught my roommates (all of them) using my special things. After the third or so time I sat them down and reminded them that this stuff was off limits and wasn't to be used by anyone other than me. They all pleaded ignorance and claimed that they just grabbed whatever their hands found, and I told them to be more careful because it meant a lot to me.

I came home yesterday and found my roommates hosting a few friends of theirs and all of them were using my special bowls and cutlery and nothing else but that. I see no way for this to accidentally happen, they were absolutely trying to bait a reaction out of me, but instead I just went to my room and waited for the guests to leave. After this during the middle of the night I took every pan, pot, knife, fork, bowl and plate and locked them in my room. It took up a lot of space but a point had to be made. 

Queue this morning, they wake up and find absolutely nothing available. Queue bitching. Queue tantrums and accusations about me being a ""dicklord"". I don't give in and tell them that if they can't respect a basic rule they can buy their own shit. I'm pretty confident in my decision and expect them to see my point after a good sit down and think, but when I regaled my boyfriend with the details he said everyone was going to think I'm an ass for good now and I had only created an awkward situation that won't go.

"TIFU by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my GF","Minor background: I am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. I'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that I was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I'm not gay, I just am me.

So while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.

I'm still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if I'm gay. And she's really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I'm not, that if I was I'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I'm pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I'm not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.

Later on, I tell Shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

We are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

AITA for not paying for the extra meal I accidentally ordered at a wedding?,"My sixteen year old son and I went to a wedding. When we got the invitation, we both chose to order chicken for the main course. There was an option to select a kid's meal version of each dish, but I never considered ordering one for my son because he is too old for kid's meals. I sent in the RSVP card with our meal selections and never heard anything about it.

At the wedding, my son and I got our food, but the table was one chicken meal short. The waiter had a small plate of chicken fingers and fries, but everyone at the table told him it must be a mistake because we didn't have any kids sitting with us. The waiters were able to put together an extra chicken plate for the person who didn't get one, and it seemed all was well.

I later got a call from the bride's parents, who told me that the chicken fingers had been for my son, and that I had caused the caterer to charge them for the extra adult chicken meal. I told them my son had asked for the adult meal, but they said he should have had the kid's meal because he's under eighteen. They said I should have known he was meant to have a kid's meal and that I should have asked for clarification if I wasn't sure. But I wasn't unsure, I never thought for a second that my son would have a kid's meal. Ten and under I would think would have kid's meals and eleven to thirteen is questionable, but fourteen and up I would never think would have a kid's meal. The bride's parents told me it's normal for anyone under eighteen to get a kid's meal, but I've never heard of eighteen being the cutoff. I think it's rude to feed a sixteen year old a meal meant for a six year old.

[Original Post here](https://amp.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b2mi6a/nc_sold_them_a_used_car_now_they_sued_me_over_it/)

This morning we had our court date, and let me tell you it was pretty quick. Got in at 8:32, out by 8:50. The plaintiff presented her case, in which she said that we hadn't disclosed an airbag light that was on the dash, and that the check engine light code we told them about was false information because it actually turned out to be another issue. Said the vehicle had more rust than they originally knew about, and that they hadn't driven it because a mechanic told them it was unsafe to drive. 

We presented our defense, clearly stating they had the opportunity to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic, but chose to take our word for it; and that we brought all known faults to their attention prior to selling them the vehicle. Anything they found after they took ownership wasn't our issue anymore, they had all chances to make a proper decision prior. We brought up the FTC's Private Sale guide stating that all cars sold from private party to private party are ""as-is"" unless otherwise stated. We neither expressed nor implied any warranties. 

Long story short, the Magistrate dismissed the case with prejudice to the Plaintiff  because NC is a ""Buyer Beware State"" and the buyer should have done all in their power to make an informed decision before purchasing the vehicle. They have 10 days to appeal, but I doubt that's gonna happen. 

Thanks to everyone that commented and gave my wife and I more information on the original post. It sure helped!

TL;DR: Magistrate heard the case, dismissed it because the buyer should have done more to inspect the vehicle.

My husband plays favorite to an extreme with our sons,"I am 29 and my husband is 33. We have two sons together, our older son is six years old and our younger son just turned five a couple months ago. 

Our first son is more outgoing and energetic while our younger one is very quiet and sweet. I will call them A and J for this story.

My husband strongly favors A. He's always happy to see him after work. He plays with him, he talks to him. He goes to all his soccer games. He's a good father with him. But to J, he barely looks at him. The most he gets is a short ""goodnight"". He'll scold him for little things like spilling water, and that's the most attention he gives him. He gives him very very little affection. The last time I saw him actually try and bond with him was on J's birthday. A is obsessed with his father, but J doesn't blink an eye if I say something about him. He looks at me like he doesn't know what I am talking about. J is very nonchalant toward his father. I can tell he notices the coldness, I see the look in his face when my husband is drooling over A. When he is home, he just sits quietly playing with his toys.

He doesn't really raise his voice or hit J, he's not cruel just so cold and distant. My husband is a more a cool and calm person, and strict even with A but he does show love when he wants to. It really bothers me, deeply that he would treat his own child like this. I feel like crying. The only thing he is equal with our sons in is gifts. But I really need him to change things. How can I talk to him about this? I have brought it up to him gently before but he only brushes me off. 

My husband doesn't like to be questioned so I am nervous but I need to protect my son's emotions. He is getting older and I am afraid of how much this will hurt him. And has hurt him. I want to know what I can do.

Until yesterday (YIFU I know). I walked one of my mother's friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. It wasn't very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. It's hot. I've just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. I want to blame dehydration for this FU, but really I know I'm just an idiot. A couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. My first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. I don't know. It's a hot day and I've seen dogs in pushchairs before. Maybe they didn't want its paws on hot tarmac. Maybe they're just a little extra. Regardless, the thought that babies exist didn't enter my tiny stupid brain. As they got up to leave and walk by me, I decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words ""What breed is it?"" and gestured towards the pushchair. They looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. It was a baby. A HUMAN baby. I'm so glad they took the traditional British approach of confused stare and silence. If they had said something I think I would have disintegrated on the spot. It was a long walk home after that and thankfully, I didn't pass anymore pushchairs. 

TL;DR I asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the Internet.",tifu
My boyfriend is into butt stuff. I am /horrified/ by assholes.,"My(F21) boyfriend(M22) really gets off on having things in his ass, and it's slowly come to full swing over the course of our relationship. I hate assholes. They do nothing for me, i don't want to look at them, touch them, have mine looked at/touched. I don't like thinking they exist. Yeah, i know it's weird; no, it really probably isn't going to change. 
My other issue here is that I'm so proud of him for it. Like, he's come so far with being comfortable with his sexual desires and i am overjoyed seeing him doing so well for himself, especially since we're long distance. 
Occasionally I'll send him nudes if I'm up in the middle of the night because he likes waking up to them, but my other problem is that now I wake up to pictures of him really hard with toys up his ass. 
I don't want this. 
I never wanted this. 
Thinking about putting things in butts makes me want to vomit and i want nothing to do with it. But I'm also in the position of not wanting to tell him because i don't want him to feel ashamed or embarrassed. Please help me. 

Edit: thank you so much for the feedback everyone, you honestly don't know how much i appreciate it, and I'm happy i came here for advice. I'm gonna talk to him tomorrow and give an update when the time comes

Edit 2: I wasn't expecting this to blow up, so thanks to everyone except a few of you. 

@ everyone giving the advice to tell him he's gay(I'm bi and we've talked about it, he's not)/discourage him from doing what sexually pleases him, fuck you guys. I'm talking to him today so I'll update again in a few hours 

The BIG EDIT: I texted him this morning and we talked about it, and everything is O.K. I feel like some of you guys are looking for a really dramatic and satisfying wrap-up but it was kind of not that big of a deal to him. I did make him laugh though because he wasn't expecting a conversation about his asshole first thing in the morning and he wants to see this post so apparently that's happening too. Again, thank you for your help everyone besides the aforementioned people in my last edit. Perhaps in another life I'll like assholes a little more. He might comment on this so if you scroll down you may or may not see some playful asshole banter between us below

Just found out my girlfriend [26F] of 6 years was cheating on me while I'm [30M] spending the holidays with her and her family.,"My girlfriend and I have been in a serious relationship for six years, and we started doing long distance relationship about 1.5 years ago due to both of us being in graduate schools. Things have been fine until five months ago when I found out she was using a subscription dating app. I was disappointed and broke up with her, but we eventually got back together because she convinced me that she didn't go on any dates with anyone on the app. I believed her because I know that she is a very traditional girl and she lives with her family. After we got back together, I felt that our relationship wasn't what it used to be, and I often felt neglected by her. She would spend a lot of time texting even when we are FaceTiming at night. She told me she texting her girl friends and I believed her. I went to celebrate the holidays with her family this winter break, and she was on her phone a bunch as usual. But I noticed that she wouldn't let me look at her phone and acting suspicious a lot of the time. She also told me she's going on a ski trip with a guy friend in March, but dodged questions when I asked for details of the guy. Finally, I've had it and looked through her FB messages, and I found conversations of her flirting with another guy for the past months. I confronted her about my findings and she admitted to having a crush on the other guy for months but nothing happened... just flirting on the internet. Plus the guy did not quite reciprocate the feelings. But upon further questioning, she told me that she actually met up with that guy two weeks ago when she came to my city to visit me (the guy lives in the state I am going to graduate school in). She told me that they only kissed that night. I asked her to show me her texts and FB messages, but she refused for several hours before letting me look through them. I found out that she's been texting and flirting with him the whole time we've been spending the holidays together, and she changed his name to a female name so I wouldn't be suspicious. She also didn't tell him that we were a couple again and still refers to me as her Ex. She was apologetic when I confronted her and I made her cancel the ski trip and cease communication with him. She reassured me that nothing will happen since he lives in my state far away from her and that he's not interested in a relationship anyway.

I feel so hurt right now and can't fall asleep. She's my first girlfriend and I love her so much. Her family treats me like another son. But the logical side of me knows that I cannot trust her anymore. I have to stay with her until Saturday and I don't know what to do. 

TL;DR long term, currently long distance girlfriend flirted with another guy via texts and FB for months even during the holidays when I'm visiting her. She met with him once when she came to my city to visit me and they kissed.

Update:
Thanks for all of the supportive comments and thank you for those that shared their similar experiences. Maybe I'm an idiot for missing all of the red flags, but hope is a helluva drug. We talked again this morning and decided breaking up was the best thing to do. It was an amicable breakup and we talked about what went right and what went wrong in our relationship (other than the part where she cheated on me). She pretty much said she didn't feel appreciated by me, and she lost her feelings for me after our initial breakup. We both agreed that she was wrong and that she should've broken up with me properly before trying to start a new relationship. She feels ashamed of what she did. I will still stay until Saturday because flight tickets are crazy expensive right now and not economically feasible for me to fly home. But we will definitely be breaking up after this incident. Being separated by thousands of miles and a jam packed curriculum from school will hopefully make this break up a bit easier. Thank you everybody for your input. ",relationship_advice

LPT: microwaving leftovers or a frozen meal? Turn the power DOWN and the timer UP. 10mins at half power does a better job than 3 minutes on full throttle. Food comes out looking like food!!!,"Seriously, microwaves only do a shit job if you're impatient. Dial the power back, cook it for longer, and go choose your show on Netflix or whatevs while it cooks - you know you're just gonna let it go cold while you choose a show anyway, so get on top of your shit, flip it and reverse it, choose the show first and enjoy your hot leftovers rather than choking down a cold soggy mess.

For example: a lean cuisine green curry & rice says on the box ""COOK ON HIGH FOR 3 MINUTES LET STAND AND SERVE"" - but it only says that because they know you're an impatient little shit and won't buy the box that says ""COOK ON 1/4 POWER FOR 12 MINUTES"" because if you're not going to cook your own calorie controlled curry, you're also not going to stand around waiting *TWELVE WHOLE MINUTES* for this one when the *other* brand says it's done in three.

I (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. Wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. Idk what to do anymore.,"I'm posting because I cannot share this with my family and I can't talk to my friends either.

Wife and I have been married for 4 years, together for 12. Last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. My brother was my hero. He was there for me when my parents abandoned us. He was there for me when I struggled with depression. He's like a father figure to me. 

So my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. He told me that it was very important. We met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. He told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

Apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. And he also started suspecting it. I was really shocked by this revelation. Because my wife never told me about this. And I never imagined she would cheat on me.

But when I confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. She didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. But my brother claims it was consensual. 

We ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. I just want to kill myself. My brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. Wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

I'm really torn. I don't think my brother is a rapist. But I'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. Also, she never told me this. She had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. Idk what to do now. I think I'm just leaving. But I want some advice to cope up.",relationship_advice

"(Update) Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

I'm sad about this update for the kid, I took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because I had questions about an issue I'm having and briefly explained it.

Officer shows up, I invite him in and explain the whole situation. He isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. Supervisor shows up and I go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where I have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

We watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. A few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what I put on the drive and then signed it, I repeated it all 3 times.

About 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 CPS workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. This took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as I remember it and left out anything I wasn't 100% sure on.

The officers and CPS workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times I'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

After they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. I'm in my garage so I don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the CPS workers van and they left. The father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

I talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. Said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

I haven't seen them since the day after the post, I feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (I didn't think it was anything like they found, I just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). I should have called them earlier once the CPS reports I was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.",legaladvice

TIFU by summoning a Kenyan drug lord on a school trip,"Yes Reddit. Its here. For those just joining us, I must again apologise for this took place some time ago.

In my second last year of secondary school I was fortunate enough to participate in a volunteer program in East Africa over my summer holidays. The idea was we'd spend a month constructing new classrooms for a struggling school on the coast of Kenya, south of Mombasa and then work in a safari park (Shimba Hills IIRC) before crossing over to Tanzania for an actual safari in Ngorongoro Crater and then top it off with an ascent of Mt Kilimanjaro. This wasn't free by the way, I had signed up for it a year before and had participated in loads of fund raising events to make it happen.

We had two teachers accompany us on the trip, Mr F who was a no nonsense former Royal Marine Commando as well as Mr B who was an absolute legend. Mr F's girlfriend also joined us, she wasn't a teacher but she had first aid qualifications. 

Mr F utterly despised me and my friends who were, embarrassingly, the sk8r/st0ner contingent of the school, with long hair, band t's, the works. To him we were useless pinheads and he sent us on all the worst jobs on the construction site. Mr B was more interested in ordering in crates of Kilimanjaro beer and trading albums with me (AFI - Sing the Sorrow for NOFX - So Long and Thanks For All The Shoes was probably my favourite swap). I wont digress too much but giving a band of Masai Mara warriors my CD player later in the trip and watching them do their leaping dances to NOFX was awesome.

During our free time we had befriended the local villagers who enjoyed inviting us to their homes for food and trying to sell us trinkets, cigarettes and awful tasting home-brewed coconut wine. Eventually the most charismatic villager, a fisherman named Sayid stepped up to the plate and offered us some weed. We bought a stick off him for about $5 down in the mangroves thinking we'd smoke it later when the teachers were asleep but he insisted on rolling it up, pure, into a single huge spliff and we hopped in his little boat and he took us on a tour of the mangrove swamp.

""You like?"" He said.
""Yeh its not bad, at home we smoke hash though, do you get it in Kenya too?"" I replied. Remember this part, as everything that happened later is contingent on this verbal exchange.

During the boat ride I wasn't feeling much, but then it suddenly hit me as we went back to shore: pure brain melt, watery bloodshot eyes, insane paranoia. Then the bell rang summoning us back to the camp. I was not ready. We tried to join up with the rest of the group as inconspicuous as possible, but likely looking as conspicuous as hell. Over the course of lunch Mr F kept on giving us weird looks, feeding my paranoia even more. Eventually his GF came up to us and said something like ""Boys, your eyes look a bit funny, what have you been up to?"" Cold sweats.
""Its just hay-fever miss, the villagers took us in the long grass and the pollen got me really bad"".
""It doesn't look like that too me, I better not see you like this again or you'll be sent home"".

About half an hour later, two unexpectedly looking nice cars came down the dirt track leading to our camp. I didn't give them much heed but they pulled up to the gate and about 5 or 6 of the scariest looking dudes got out. 

""[My name], can you come to the gate, some people want to speak to you"" someone said, I don't remember who. 

As I was still high I started to panic again and the paranoia was back. I walked over to them. I'm not sure how the conversation went, but the scope of this most colossal fuck up dawned on me. Sayid had totally misunderstood me with his broken English. He had thought that I was asking to send hash back home and this was his lucky day and he could act as broker for a deal that would set him up for life, likely calling someone who called someone else and so on until the news had reached some senior guy from Mombasa who had come down to the camp to strike a deal. And listen Reddit, before you jump on me and call me an idiot and tell me not to travel, lets think about this first. In no way is this a reasonable outcome for the conversation I just had. Yeh fine, smoking on a school trip is never a good idea, but I was in the army cadets for 4 years and every trip turned into a smoke up after dark without incident.

I think I managed to mumble some sort of feeble excuse like ""I'm sorry I have to go"". Then I ran and hid in the toilets and locked the door.

About a minute later I heard Mr F yell my name.

""Where the fuck are you, you filthy little druggie""
""Where is he boys?""
""Hes in the toilet sir""
Silence, then Mr F's huge tree trunk arms pounding on the door.
""You fucking little shit, what have you done? Who are these people? Come out here now""

""I can't sir.... I'm on the toilet, its really bad"" This was sadly the best thing I could think of.
""Get the fuck out here now""
""I can't sir, its diarrhoea, really bad""
""You fucking little liar, open this door""

He was trying to shake it off its hinges. I wanted to die, I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me, I was going to get expelled, my parents were going to kill me, my life was effectively over.

At this point Mr F's girlfriend and Mr B stepped in, urging him to calm down.

""Let us talk to him"". 
""What happened, why are these people here""
""I'm so sorry, I was just talking about weed and he must of got the wrong idea, I have no idea how this could of happened.""

Somehow it was smoothed over, I don't know how, but I stayed in that toilet for hours, fearing shame, mockery and punishment when eventually that door was opened. When I came out the dealers from Mombassa were gone. The teachers had searched all my stuff and found nothing which had further supported my defence. 

The rest of the trip passed without incident. I wasn't expelled, my parents weren't called, Mr F was even nice to me after a few days, probably embarrassed about totally flipping out. Sure there were a few jokes but it was just too surreal to continually feel bad about. Also I think Mr B and Miss F had done me a huge favour by calming Mr F, coming to my defence and for that I am forever grateful.

TL;DR a simple misunderstanding during a conversation with an enterprising Kenyan fisherman resulted in gangsters driving down from Mombassa to arrange terms with me for a hash smuggling operation back to the UK, temporarily making a teacher go berserk at me.

On a final note before I go to bed: Travel has really helped me with some serious issues in my life such as depression, anxiety and low self esteem.

Its been awhile since my original post, but I didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

Since then, not much has improved. I decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. To my surprise, she agreed and I was so happy.

Unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  I had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

This was the hardest thing I have ever had to do.  I feel so broken right now.  I'm going to see a counselor in hopes that I can figure out what to do.

I dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but I pray that she takes advantage of it because I still love her and I did this because I still do.

I told myself I would stop enabling her, mainly because I just cannot sustain this life. I am physically and mentally exhausted.  My kids are my top priority but I cant take care of them if I dont first take care of myself.

I thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. She was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and I hope that it will help her.

Things go to shit and we break up. Talk of custody and child support comes up and I tell her I was going to try for custody.

TIFU by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life,"This is long so TLDR at the bottom.

This happened around 6 years ago when I was in 9th grade. I grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. My parents never taught me anything about genitals and I apparently never asked, all I knew was that's where the pee came out.

So one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. I was pretty shocked because that's certainly not how mine worked. By that time I was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

So armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work I went home and a few google searches led me to discover that I had a severe case of phimosis. So being the pragmatic young buck that I am I also google how to fix it. There were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. Not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel I opted for the latter option. I got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom's bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

After about 4 hours of stretching I finally started making some progress! I could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. Everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell I've ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. It dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. I kept stretching over the course of a few days and I started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as I stretched. Some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as Dick Cheese. 

I cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. That was about to change real fucking fast.

So this was about 10 days into my stretching and I'd gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. I was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so I got very impatient and I decided I'd try to force it all the way back that day I lubed and got to work, I pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. I pulled it till I couldn't bear the pain anymore. I did this over and over again for around 3 hours until I somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. I got way too excited and despite the pain I gave it one big yank and I felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. It hurt like hell but I was just so relieved that I didn't care. I opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. The entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. That was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where I tore the top part of my foreskin when I yanked it over the glans. I freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. It eventually stopped and then I had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. I eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. I was still hurting but I was finally done. I got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. I thought that was it. I tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn't budge so I just left it.I completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. You know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? That's how my penis looked. I went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

When I got home I was still in major pain so I decided I'd check on it. I undressed in the shower and looked down at it. The first thing I saw were the blisters. Two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. The next thing I noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. I'm a black guy.

I realized that if I didn't find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. I lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. This was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. I kept trying to force it back over and I put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  My penis was on fire at this point and I was holding back tears but I kept pushing until I felt it pop back over the glans. Judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain I felt I guess the second blister popped too. Once again I left it and fucking went to bed. 

I checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. I rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks I was pretty much ok. My foreskin was still tight and I do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

Also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. Even if they aren't as stupid as I was don't take that risk lol

TL;DR; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because I got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn't get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

EDIT: So I didn't expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

So while I'm happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, I'd like to clear up something. This post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. Circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  Rather, I'd like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

For those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. Don't be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. They have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. For those of you who aren't old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. Believe me it's not as awkward that you think. Don't risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like. ",tifu

"I received an email with my password for another site in the subject line, blackmailing me for bitcoins... Is there anything I should do?","The email claims to have video footage of me watching porn taken from my webcam, which means the threat is rubbish because I have neither watched porn nor had a webcam in about 15 years (as a teen).

The email has no identifying info besides password and email - no name except what's in my email address.

Given that the threat isn't credible, BUT it's a legitimate password and attempted blackmail, should I do anything? Report to police? Try to report to Neopets? Ignore and delete?

"My (20F) boyfriend (20M) invites my best friend (20F) out to games, just the two of them.","My boyfriend(lets call him J) and I have been together for a year and me and my best friend(lets call her G) have been friends since grade school. J and G are both varsity players and are addicted to watching sports. They would follow hockey, baseball, soccer, football, basketball, like almost any game they love. However, i'm not really a sports person but still I would make the effort to attend their games. I would also make an effort to learn and understand their games. J plays football and G plays soccer.

J was using my laptop and forgot to logout his facebook account. I know its wrong to snoop but I couldn't help it. Some his teammates were messaging him and I clicked on the message icon and saw that he was messaging G. I got curious and scrolled through it and saw that he invited G out to multiple games, saying that he will buy 2 tickets for this game or that game. G would decline and tell him that he should invite me. J then said that I wouldn't understand and that I was not fun to be with in these kinds of things. G said that he is being unfair to me. J still sends multiple messages to G about wanting to talk and wanting to go out with her.

This has been going on for months. G has said nothing to me about this and the only thing that she did to kinda allude to the situation is to text me list of games that I should watch because those are J's favorite teams.

I kinda feel betrayed by both of them. Although I feel more betrayed by J than G.

What should I do? How should I approach this?

**UPDATE**: Thank you everyone for your advice. I approached G first and told her that I've seen the messages. She was relieved that I came to her and talked to her about it. She explained that she didn't know what to do because she didn't want to do anything that would destroy our friendship. She also assured me that next time she will tell me if anything shady like this happens again and that she will always have my back. We both apologized to each other and hugged it out.

I also have to admit that snooping through J's messages are wrong. The reason I did that because there are some rumours that he hits on other girls at away games and I was feeling insecure and worried about it. But it still does not justify the way I went about it.

As for J, we will meet up later tonight. I honestly think it is over between us. He also has a lot of guys friends to go with him to games and he also would never invite me. I would rather salvage my relationship with my friend, than continue my relationship with him and stay feeling insecure.

Thank you people of reddit for the advice.

**UPDATE 2**: G told me that I should start by saying ""Hey, G told me that you were inviting her out to games"" and I did exactly that. J became defensive and told me that he never invited her. I told him that I saw the messages and he asked if G showed me the messages. I told him the truth that I saw it through his fb and he was furious at me. He told me that I violated his privacy and I apologized for it. Then he told me that he was asking out G because his friends felt that G was a lesbian. He was trying to get proof by asking her out and that her not reciprocating is proof that she is one. At this point I'm like ""WHAAAAAT?!"". He said that he was doing that to protect me and I'm like WHAT?. He then left and told me that he needed space and that I should text him after I got my head cleared up. I texted him ""stay away from me and G"". That was honestly a wild ride.",relationship_advice
TIFU by not washing anything I own for over a year,"So this was an ongoing fuck up that occurred over the past year and a half.  We ran out of laundry detergent and my wife and I separately stopped at the store (we both didn't know the other was stopping) and bought some. (Edit: we both bought the same thing) 

So that's the laundry detergent I've been using to wash everything for nearly a year and a half. Clothing, towels, sheets etc. all of it. I basically grabbed each bottle of detergent in turn so they both lasted forever 

Finally both bottles hit empty about a week ago and I dragged my ass to the store because I needed clean towel. I head to the detergent section and grab the same bottle I've been using for a year an a half (free and gentle. I don't like scented stuff) 

That's when I freeze. Because the bottle I'm holding, the same type of bottle I've been using for a year and a half... well I didn't grab it from the detergent section and it didn't say detergent on it.   

No that bottle said fabric softener. Not laundry detergent. No soap or cleaning agent that I'm aware of. None.   For a YEAR AND A HALF I've been softening the hell out of my clothing but not actually using detergent. 

I didn't want to believe it.   Ran back to the laundry room at my apartment where the trash hasn't been emptied and check the old bottle.   Fabric softener. 

I'm in shock. My wife has been complaining about the towels smelling for months and I thought it was in her head (I have a terrible sense of smell anyway but I knew I was washing the towels regularly) turns out I haven't washed those towels with detergent since we bought them.    She wondered why her whites always seemed dingy even when freshly washed.   Well now we know.   Because FABRIC SOFTENER... 

So now I've been washing everything I own and holy shit what a difference it makes when you actually use detergent. 



TL:DR I used fabric softener instead of laundry detergent for a year and a half, now I feel dirty and have to wash everything in my closet 


Edit: a proper TL:DR


Edit:   A lot of you are overusing detergent.  Check the cap. The fill line for a load is usually a half inch or less above the bottom of the cap, not the top. (I see the irony of me saying this but read the label. It's pretty clear how little you actually need) 

Edit3: for fucks sake people, stop telling me to not use fabric softener on towels. I DIDNT THINK I WAS!",tifu

"My truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction. [WA state]","My truck ('87 beater, not worth much but very important to me as a spent a lot of time fixing it up) was stolen in mid October. I immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

Fast forward to last Friday, I receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... On November 1! Six weeks prior! From my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

I called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. A later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which I would think is illegal. Apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but I had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. I had no idea it had even been recovered!

All I really want is my truck back, which I don't think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. Am I entitled to compensation? And from whom? The towing company sold it before it's stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. Do I have legal recourse here?

I have tried to speak with police but cannot get in touch with their ""complaint hotline"" until tomorrow. Same situation with the towing company.

TIFU by being too horny for my boyfriends good [NSFW],"Obligatory happened a couple days ago

I was enjoying a lovely morning with my boyfriend. Talking, cuddling, farting together... you know the drill. Just the comfortable phase of relationship when you no longer worry about being perfect human beings.
Well, after some cuddling, I noticed that his morning wood wasn't gone. At all. And even though we had some amazing sex last night, I decided I wanted more. He was just so sexy, laying in his bed, I couldn't resist.

After some teasing, we went to do it. We're pretty boring, maybe too romantic and really lazy, so we wanted just a classic missionary. Ya know, nothing too wild. But I want it quick and kinda rough.

While we were doing it, I'm telling him to speed up, even though I know he is tired from yesterday. And he does.

Suddenly, he tells me he got a cramp in his back. Okay, I thought, it will go away. It will be fine. It's just a cramp. Let's continue. Right?

Wrong.

He stopped. His face looked like he was in a lot of pain. His whole body looked like he was in a lot of pain. And he was still  inside of me.

Then he told me:""Babe? I can't move. It hurts. I think I'm gonna need help.""

Well.

I had to carefully operate myself from under him and take off his condom. I also had to try not to burst out laughing because of the absurdity or crying because he was in pain. 

The best part? Trying to put his pants up, so he won't be totally naked when the fucking ambulance I had to call will arrive. The whole time he was almost screaming from pain.

The REALLY best part? Trying to frantically get rid off all evidence of what we were doing just for him to tell everyone ""Yeah, I did this to myself during morning sex with my girlfriend.""

Now he is stuck in bed for a week and I'm wondering if my pussy was really worth calling ambulance and all that pain.

TLDR; My vagina apparently feels so good my boyfriend got an acute lumbago in his back while being in it.

Edit: Guys, the TLDR was a sarcasm and a joke.

Edit 2: Aaaand he laughs about it now too. He was the one asking me to cover him so noone else would see him bare naked.

[AZ] Discovered a video of my father raping me as a child,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder.

I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family.

TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend's phone NSFW [UPDATE],"So some of you may remember my original post where I accidentally saw pictures of my girlfriend sucking the biggest dick I've ever seen:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bo6nut/tifu_by_swiping_on_my_girlfriends_phone_nsfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I've had had thousands of messages asking for an update, and a similar amount of messages asking for the pictures (I don't have them and I don't want to see them again).

The truth is there isn't much of an update because I never confronted her about it. I decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.

Our sex life is back to normal and I feel like I've mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. We all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.  

I thought I would also use this as an opportunity to address some of the most common questions/comments.

WHY DOES SHE STILL HAVE THE PICTURES?

Honestly I think she probably forgot. We all have stuff on our phones going back years. I found some nudes of exes that I had forgotten about so I guess I'm as bad as her.

HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HER EX?

Because I could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in

WAS IT PHOTOSHOPPED OR A STRAP-ON?

No

YOU MUST BE EXAGGERATING NO DICK IS THAT BIG

2 coke cans is about right. It was bigger than her forearm.

As you can imagine, I've also received a bunch of dick pics in my DMs with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. Thanks for that chaps.  

A DICK THAT BIG COULDN'T GET HARD

It certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. So maybe you're right.

HER PUSSY MUST BE STRETCHED/CAVERNOUS/GAPING

She probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls I've been with. I guess you don't know how vaginas work.

Can't wait until Thursday....My(48M) wife(44F) is going to be SHOCKED,"[**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

So, wife and I have been together 17 years.  We are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  About two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  So off we got to the GP, who gives us a consult to a Rheumatologist.  Come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  Fast forward to a month ago, when our North Texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  She woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were HUGE, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  And even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  So, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  So, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from Ireland and custom designed, and have words in Gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  She was absolutely GUTTED.  I assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but I could tell, to her, it was.

Begin Sherlock Holmes Mode.  I googled until I couldn't google anymore.  I was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  I searched some more.  I finally found his personal Facebook page, and I message him, and wait......and wait......

I finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her Da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  I express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  I go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  She tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

Fast forward a couple of weeks.  I get a message on Facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  She explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and MOLDS in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  She sent pictures, and I confirmed that YES - THOSE ARE OUR RINGS!  She said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

I open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  OF OUR RINGS.  She went ahead and had her BROTHER, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  I asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and I was allowed to keep my old one.  She told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  I asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

Our ""New"" Wedding Bands will be here Thursday.

Trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has NO IDEA any of this took place.

\*Edit - I rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her I was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  The absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to NOT tell her as we tell each other EVERYTHING.  So now I not only need to figure out HOW to do this, but NOT to spill the beans until then.  (Our friends nicknamed us Mickey and Mallory as well as Marshall and Lilly from ""How I Met Your Mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*Edit 2 - I thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where I actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (VA Nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so ALWAYS goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when I originally proposed, I waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*Edit 3 - And to those of you saying ""I"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  SHE is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  She is the reason I breathe, and supported all of us when I went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  She is my hero.  I wake up every day to earn her all over again.  This was one small thing I was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why I have a heartbeat.  And I don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if I seem sappy.  If a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

TL;DR Wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, I went Hardy Boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  Was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

AITA for spraying the neighborhood kids with my garden hose?,"I love strawberries. I love them so much that I planted 300 strawberry plants in my garden. After I harvest, I make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. I donate the leftovers to my local food bank.

Lately I've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. The last time I caught them I threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.

I caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police I grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard. 

I just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. Absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. One parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iPhone 10 was ruined with water. I told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. Then I threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property.",AmItheAsshole
AITA for messing with my sister's fake profile?,"Going to try to make this quick. I'm 22 and my sister is 18. I went to my sister's room to grab a top she had borrowed(we do this all the time, borrow clothes go into each other's rooms to get them back) and I notice she has Facebook open and the profile pic is...well..me. I have to do a double take because it really caught me off guard. I know I shouldn't have but I snooped at the profile and it was just pictures of myself- my sister literally has a fake Facebook profile of me.

I'm livid at this point for many reasons. 1. I don't do social media. I'm a private person and I don't like pictures of me to be on profiles like that. 2. Some of the pictures she had were ones that she took without me knowing 3. Other pictures that she had were ones I had sent to friends which means she has gone onto my computer and taken pictures off.

I delete all of the pictures and I check her computer and find a folder filled with pictures that she has taken of me and ones that were on my computer- not even all of me per se, ones of my friends, group photos, food I had taken pictures of. I go through even more and find out that she has even stolen nudes that I had taken for my boyfriend.

I deleted the folder completely and went back to the fake facebook profile. I uploaded a single picture of her with the caption ""The real me"", changed her name(she was using my middle name and a fake last name) and then left her room. I've heard her sobbing from her room all day but I'm too angry and embarrassed to even confront her right now. AITA for messing with the profile and not just confronting her in the beginning?

&#x200B;

Update: I decided to confront my sister since I couldn't stand sitting around with a knot in my stomach. As soon as she saw me she started crying and begging me not to tell our parents and saying she was sorry. I told her that I don't think I could ever forgive her and that it made me sick to even look at her. I asked her why she had the fake profile. Apparently she met a guy 1 or  2 years ago on another site and she was too nervous to give him a picture of herself so she sent one of me. He really liked the picture and from then on it just snowballed. She got deeper into it, made the profile and said that she enjoyed all the attention it got her. I brought up the nudes and she played dumb at first, and then said that she must've accidentally copied them over too. I told her that I didn't believe her but she's sticking with that. I asked her to delete the facebook and got the e-mail and information attached to it so that I can change it and make sure she doesn't try to reactivate it. She tried to make me feel bad and tell me that she was gonna lose a lot of her friends because of this and how that was the reason she did it in the first place. At that point I just felt like she only felt bad she was caught and didn't really care about my feelings. I told her that she was being selfish for only thinking about how this hurt her but never thought about how her lies hurt me. She got upset again and I left shortly after. 

&#x200B;

I saw people mentioning that I should change my password on my computer- I've done that. I've explained the situation to my boyfriend and he offered to let me move in with him which I'm probably going to take him up on. I can't be in the house anymore- I feel so uncomfortable and I feel so paranoid about running into people that she may have talked to or sent pictures to.

TIFU giving myself head and throwing out my back,"(reposted at the appropriate time with some adjustments!)

This happened about 3 days ago, i'm finally able to move and get out of bed.

So I am generously endowed, and have a very good relationship with my dick. Lol. I occasionally post images on reddit and other places, and someone asked me if i could perform auto-fellatio. I hadn't ever thought of it, so I read some tips, watched some videos and realized that because of my size and my general skinny frame, i have the ideal body type for sucking my own D. How exciting lol.
So, there are a few different approaches, leaning forward or legs over your head. I tried the leaning forward approach but had no luck at all, so then i was like fuck it, got naked, layed down near a wall, threw my legs over my head, and slowly ""walked down the wall"" as the advice was. Holy shit i was close. Let me also say i was very aroused at the moment, and this was a few days of arousal, so my cock was extra hard and the head was pulsating. As the head flexed and i did, i got my tongue on the tip of my dick basically on the first try. WOW. I was excited and turned on, and hard as fuck.

So, i started stroking and pulling my cock closer to my mouth and it started getting even harder and now i can basically put my lips on the head. it felt insane and i was so happy. as i was stroking, my lips were able to almost fully cover the head, and i started to suckle. it didn't take much. the whole situation caused a deep orgasm. the shaking kind.

sidebar- yes i came in my mouth. for reference i am totally straight and have never had a dick in my mouth. okay back to the story...

so i'm shaking, feet over my head, dick in my mouth, and the final release pushed my body into a further position, and there it was. not really sure what popped, but i collapsed onto my side and literally couldn't move. cum dripping out of my mouth, laying on my side, naked, in the bathroom.
luckily feeling came back soon and but i couldnt stand up. crawled to bed... had a friend bring me some muscle relaxers, said i tweaked it ""cleaning under the counters"" lol. still in bed, but can actually walk today for the first day. 

luckily i don't need to explain this to a doctor.

tl:dr - sucked my own d, came in my mouth, threw out my back.

edit:  thank you for all of the advice (and the offers, lol).  i will not fuck around with this any more.

edit 2: i spit, but not totally intentionally.  it was that moment that all went to hell.  not sure what i would have done if i was thinking about it.

edit 3:  c'mon guys, sucking your own dick is as gay as jerking off or playing with your ass.  get over it. if you're that afraid of you're own body, that's weird, and super homophobic

edit 4: ""i've heard it feels more like sucking dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i've never sucked a dick, so i can't tell you, and yes, it didn't feel like getting head from another person.  but it was very pleasurable and felt better than my good ol' hand.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.,"A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

""No,"" replied the guy. ""He choked on a sock.""",Jokes
TIFU by blowing my load absolutely everywhere during a massage,"So this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.

I visited Thailand in September '15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. This meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and I never felt OK jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so I decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. I was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.

One morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on Koh Samui, I decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. After a little splash around I used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, I didn't think much of it. I then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious Pad Thai.

I suffer from ongoing back pains, so when I hit Thailand I took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. Now, considering how vulgar my username is, I am actually bit of a prude. I didn't want any ""rug and tug"" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once I start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? Not that I'm chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. So, after being a little drunk and full of food I decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.

This wasn't one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. I went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. I asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought I was after anything ""extra"") and got ready. It was only when I started taking my sweatpants off that I remembered that I was free-balling, I explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst I awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.

The first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones I'd had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (I'm a big fan of more aggressive massages), I was in absolute bliss. Then came the time for the front. Look, by this point I had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had ""awoken the beast"" to some level or another. With this massage I was at absolute full-mast. One of those ""I've not jerked off in three weeks"", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. I apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. She laughed and started working on my legs, I started relaxing a bit more, I imagined it was nothing she hadn't seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. She went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch I imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. I went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.

Cum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that I thought I'd broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but I also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. All the while I'm desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. Mostly despair. After a short while, the fireworks were over. There was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. I realised that I'd been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this Gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. Wordlessly I put my clothes on, not making eye contact, I pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 Baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. I often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.

Edit - Typos  


Edit 2 - After desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as I could, I received a notification that I'd hit the front page. So, I guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y'all, I still need to work too. In all honesty, I wrote up this event because I had been told I had to during one of the many times I have regaled people with it. I had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so I posted it typos and all. I did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and I am grateful beyond words. Every little complement and giggle is doing more good than I think most people would realise. Thank you.

Kicked our at 16. Parents took all my money.,"I had posted this on other subs and was told to post here. 16f.

Three nights ago my parents and I got in a huge fight. I am not a Christian. They are extreme bible thumpers. I am bisexual, they believe I'm going to be burning in hell. I was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. 

I managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. We just moved to this state so I have no friends. My siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. My related family is all thousands of miles away. Last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. Right now I am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and American bulldog, sleeping in my car. My parents forced me to quit my job last week so I could focus more on school. Last night I checked my bank account. My parents drained the 1k savings I had in it. It is completely empty. 

I'm just scared and don't know where to turn. I primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. I do not want to give them up but I'm not sure how much longer I can without neglecting them. Giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. I will not give up on them easily. Having them around has protected me from many bad situations. 

I live in Tennessee. Any advice would be helpful. 

I also do not want to return home. My mother is abusive. DCS has seen physical evidence of abuse (black eye, bloody scratch marks, bruises) and placed me back in the home. They are useless.",legaladvice
My (19F) boyfriend (20M) broke up with me because I'm too good at sex,"We've been dating for a year and he's a year older than me and we met in college. We took things slow bc we're both virgins and it's special to both of us so we agreed we'd wait until we're really in love and sure about each other. And after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

Even after our first time, he asked me if I really was a virgin or if I lied because I was too good. No I didn't lie. I just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. Since then, he'd get weird during sex. Like if I did something good, he'd say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. Now I know he was questioning if I really was a virgin. 

Anyway. He broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. TMI I was riding him and he said I act like a porn star and he's obviously not the only guy I've been with and he thinks I lied to him. I told him I watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn't believe me. 

Great. Never thought I'd be dumped for being too good at sex. It just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we'd be long term and we broke up already. I want him back. I know he's just being paranoid. How do I tell him that I wasn't lying?

(UPDATE) NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"[original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/)

I went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. She took one look at the letter from my friend Aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

She contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me Aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if I heard more otherwise no need for more action.

Aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. He wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. I hadn't complained to them myself so I did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

TIFU by losing track of where my dog is.,"Throwaway account so imma get very pissed if this gets a lot of points.

So I live with my family and my dog spends her nights in my room which means walking her in the mornings is usually my responsibility. This morning (obligatory this actually happened today) i went downstairs and open the door to let the dog out first before putting on shoes and grabbing my keys, in case she was bursting to go (i got up quite late since i graduated high school and pretty much just lounge about helping out at home) she can do it outside rather than in the house. By the time i'd gotten ready though the dog was nowhere to be seen.

Now i wasn't too concerned since she can't get past the locked gate, so i knew she wasn't lost. After searching the garden i figured she must have done what she needed to do, and snuck back in to get another nap in (she's a lazy pupper). I went back inside and, since the rest of the house was still asleep (or so i thought), i didn't want to yell for her, so i resorted to check each room.

So the sleeping arrangements in my family is kind of unusual. I have a small sister who doesn't like to spend the night alone, so she chooses a parent to spend the night with in the double bed, while the remaining parent is ""banished"" to her room with the twin size bed, i get my own room. After checking the dog is not in mine or the small bedroom, i figured she'd gone to snuggle with my sister and dad in the big bedroom, so i went in to drag her out because _dammit_ i was determined to get my morning walk.

In i went, and it took me about 30 seconds to realise my mistake: the silhouette in the single bed had been way too small to be my mum. They must have gotten up, carried my sleeping sister to her own room, my mum snuck in with my dad, because there they were, on the double bed, _going at it_

Turns out 30 seconds wasn't fast enough to piece the story together because just as i realised and panicked and tried to leave, my mum looks up and we make solid eye contact while i'm pretty sure my dad's dick was still inside her (not that i was keen to verify or think about it). I was catatonic as this point and my brain shut down and i just turned on my heels and left, with a deadpan expression this whole time.

My sister is no longer allowed to sleep in the big bedroom. And yes, turns out the dog was indeed in the room at the time.

TL;DR: let my dog slip into my parent's bedroom, went in to get her, broke my 18 years streak of managing to avoid catching my parents in the act of producing more siblings for me.

Edit: let the records show that the first thing i did after getting tf out of that room was to check on my sister (who was awake by this time) and tell her to leave our parents alone for a while.",tifu
Daughter's friend (F18) is making me (M45) uncomfortable,"I have known this girl for years. She always was a sweet girl and one of the things I always liked about her and my daughter was that they were never the type to be 14 going on 40. Her family life is stable as far as I know and up until around 6 months ago she treated me like an adult - that is, a vaguely human shaped object that dispensed lifts and shit music.

&#x200B;

But around the time of my wife leaving my daughter and I, she and my daughter started making jokes between each other about getting me a new girlfriend. When I'd overhear, I'd ignore it and the two of them would go all red and embarrassed.

&#x200B;

Then it seems to have escalated to her getting uncomfortably flirty with me. I acted dumb initially, but had to actually say something to her about it, because it was getting way too... frank? It stopped for a while, but after turning 18, she started up again and just made fun of me when I try to tell her to stop.

&#x200B;

So, to avoid anything else, I cut myself out of giving rides if she was in the party or being anywhere where she might be. But the past two weekends, she has called me in the middle of the night drunk as hell saying that she is going to walk home if I don't pick her up. So I pick her up, she gets really handsy to the point where I was having trouble driving, and every time I stop, she tries to put my hands on her.

&#x200B;

The first time I got her home, she got herself under control, and while her mother raised an eyebrow, she mostly believed my denials of getting her into this state. The second time, she didn't and it was bad. I was telling the truth, and even I thought I was a sleaze. I told her mother that I was indeed stupid for not calling her instead and should the girl try anything like that again, I'll call her instead of going anywhere.

&#x200B;

I really don't know what is going on here. I am a balding, overweight middle-aged man who feels like I am the butt of a joke somewhere having this 18-year-old acting so obsessively over me. I have spoken to my daughter about it who initially thought it was funny, but after a conversation with her friend is now kinda worried as well.

&#x200B;

I am sure that something else is going to happen, and I just need some advice on getting her to realize she should be with boys her own age.

&#x200B;

**\*\*Edit: For the silly dickheads saying the equivalent of ""fuck her, hurr""\*\***

I have known this girl for 10 years. She was less than three feet tall when I first met her. She has come to sleepovers, birthday parties and family holidays. She has reached an arbitrary age that has confused her and is still learning the power of her femininity. She is acting in a way that could be dangerous around the wrong person.

I want her to find true happiness in her life and I want her and my daughter to stay friends so they can lean on each other during the difficulties of adulthood. The last thing I want is to mess up a young woman's mind and emotions for the sake of an orgasm. I am fairly sure it would mess me up as well.

**So for fucks sake, lay off the porn and have some god-damned sense.**

&#x200B;

**2nd Edit: A few questions answered**

1. My relationship with my wife broke down because she was ashamed of a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and refused to treat it. She became dangerous to live with and was arrested after a violent incident. She blamed me for her arrest and moved away. There has been no contact from her since she left. I have no ill-will towards her, but at the same time want nothing to do with her anymore.
2. My friend's daughter lives with her mother and sister. She has very little contact with her father. For example, he did not show up for her graduation or her prom but did send a card for her birthday. The mother is an immigrant from Greece and can be very dramatic over things that aren't a big thing here.
3. I gave her a ride because I have fostered an environment of safety over discipline with my daughter and her friends/boyfriends. When I was that age, I did not call my parents when I was high or drunk because the discipline was often worse than whatever danger I was in. I am known in her friends circle as someone safe to call when they need to get home without giving any grief. My daughter's friend is not the only one I have given rides to.
4. My daughter initially thought it was funny and that her friend was just messing with me. When she spoke to her, my daughter didn't tell me much but agreed that I have to stay away from her.
5. It really breaks my heart to go no-contact with her as she is the oldest and closest friend of my daughter. But at this stage I have to.
6. I don't really drink anymore and on the rare occasions I do, I am usually camping with the dog at least half a day's hike away from the car, so would never drive drunk.

Teachers are not martyrs. They are working professionals trying to make a living just like the rest of us and the self-righteous attitude many of them have is honestly so annoying.,"Teachers like to complain about how they aren't paid enough and act like they're God's gift to society. Now I'm not denying their importance but the thing is, all professions are important. Doctors, lawyers, accountants, cleaners and garbage collectors all have important roles to play in society, and their pay is determined by the market and they only work 9 months of the year. 

Also the thing is, many teachers suck. They literally just read off slideshows and textbooks, in my opinion only maths and science teachers really deserve credit. 

When I was in grade 5 my one teacher left halfway through the year and came back the next year (presumably with full pay) because she couldn't handle how naughty the kids were. Like woman, that's your job. Also, when I was in grade 10 my accounting teacher had a breakdown because one of the kids told her she was a shitty teacher (and truth be told, he wasn't wrong). She went crazy at him, kicked him out of the class and didn't come to work for 2 weeks after that. Like, wtf. I worked as a waiter for several years during college and if a customer complained about me, I'd have to just suck it up and carry on, I couldn't lose my cool at the customer and God forbid I'd go AWOL for 2 weeks. 

So yeah. Teachers like to act like they sacrificed their lives for the good of education, which they didn't. They chose to teach as a career and must deal with the good and bad aspects of the job.",unpopularopinion

Update: I (34M) think my wife (32F) is cheating on me.,"Original post from a few weeks ago:I travel a lot for work. I'm usually gone Tuesday through Thursday 3 times a month. My wife is a stay at home mother for our two children 3 and 5. We have a nanny that helps out 4 days a week during the day, so that my wife can take care of her errands and shopping. 
About 6 months ago I caught my wife in a lie. Not a big lie just her telling me she was somewhere when I knew she wasn't. It bothered me but not to the point where I was extremely concerned. Then a week before the 4th of July I came home early from my trip I wanted to surprise her, the next day was the anniversary of the day we had met. I had also received a fairly large bonus two weeks earlier and was going to surprise her with the trip I booked for us to go to St Martin for a week. It was late when I got in from the airport around 11:30pm and we had FaceTimed about three hours earlier so I could see her and the kids. She never mentioned anything about going out that night. When I got home the nanny was there, she said to me that my wife had left about an hour and a half ago. I texted my wife asked her what she was up too, and she responded saying she was about to go to bed. I said thats funny because I just got home and you're not here. 
When she got home she was telling me that she was just out with two of her friends, she named them, and just didn't want me upset that she wasn't home with the kids (usually one of our parents would watch the kids at night we had never used the nanny before), I didn't really buy her excuse,  but I had no proof and she wasn't admitting to anything. 
The next day I ordered a gps tracker for her vehicle. I haven't told her about it. And since then I have caught her in several lies, and I'm not even trying to set her up. She is just telling me she is at one place and I can see she is clearly not. 
Should I confront her with what I did and why is she lying to me or hire a private investigator to get proof of infidelity if it is happening? 

TLDR I caught my wife in a lie so I got a gps for her car. Then I caught her in multiple lies.

I hired a private investigator, gave him a lot of information. My wife has been acting normal all day. We had plans tonight, I canceled told her I was not feeling well (which is the truth). I don't think anything else will happen until I leave Tuesday morning. I plan on calling my friend who is an attorney on Monday, even though he is not a divorce lawyer I'm sure he can point me in the right direction. Thanks for all the kind words and a few not so kind. I'll update when the PI does his thing.

Update: so I hired a private investigator to follow my wife when I left on Tuesday. He first followed her to the grocery store, he said he saw her purchase two visa gift cards. He told me that could be how she is paying the nanny for the extra time without giving her a check or CC. She left the house for a second time around 12:30 pm and went to the same location she has been going to. He witnessed an suv pull up and she got in. He followed the vehicle to a gated community where he lost sight of them. He was not able to view the driver due to the dark tint. He has a realtor license and used that to get in, but by the time he got to the house they were already inside. They were there for about 3.5 hours. He then saw my wife and another lady leave the house in the same vehicle, he followed them back to where my wife's car was parked. She went home and didn't leave the rest of the day.

Wednesday 8/14 she went to a few shops with the kids. That night around 9:15 (I FaceTimed her and the kids around 8:30) she left and went to the same location. She again met with the same women. This time they went to a restaurant and ate for a little over an hour, then back to her house til 1:15am. She was again dropped off at her car and then went home.

So there was no guy involved at least this week, but she never told me she was going out for dinner or anything. I really don't know what to do now. The PI was pretty expensive I'm not sure I want to hire him again. Not sure if I should confront her or just try an get more information on my own.

Update: so these last few weeks have been difficult. I kept the PI following her when I have been out of town. It has been the same thing she meets at the same place and the same woman picks her up. This Wednesday they went to dinner instead of her house. The PI got a photo of them embracing and a single kiss when they got to the place where my wife parks. The kiss is not something just friends would do. This is the first real evidence I have gotten, other than just strong suspicion. 
I flew home a day early, and last night I confronted her with the photos. I didn't tell her how I got them or that I had hired a PI. I asked her to explain why she was cheating and how long it had been going on. She basically denied everything and said that they were just friends. She then tried to accuse me of spying on her and invading her privacy. I couldn't believe it, even with the photos and her lying she wanted to blame me. 
I haven't moved forward with the divorce or anything yet, I'm still hoping she will come clean and tell me the truth.

Update: so I have the woman's name,age and where she works from the PI. She is single no kids, she has a Facebook account but no personal information on relationship status or recent posts or likes and she is not friends with my wife. No instagram or Twitter that he can find either. I think I'm done with him he found out enough.",relationship_advice
TIFU by being funnier than my SO and allowing her to post it on reddit.,"This happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. 

Last night while my SO was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. She is a bartender and didn't want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

Me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. So I jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

While I'm making my journey, I decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. I'm in a pretty great mood. I had the day off and my SO was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some New Girl. 

My journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. Just open desert. So while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. ""What can I do to add a little romance to this situation? Cover the bed in some dove chocolates? Maybe some flowers?"" 

I make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. Miraculously, I made it back home before her.

Finally I decide, ""Nah, romance isn't nearly as great as comedy."" So when I get home, I break open the box and spell out ""Anal?"" on the bed with the tampons. 

SO gets home and goes straight to the room to change. I follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

She takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. Now she won't stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is ""famous"". 

I've created a monster. 

TLDR; Spelled out ""Anal?"" with my SO's tampons. She thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. Reddit agreed and now she thinks she's famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.

Edit: WOW! My first ever medal. Thank you kind stranger. Now at least I can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.

Edit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. Whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.

Edit 3: we are ending this ""contest"" at 11:59 PST on 7/17/19. It looks like I am going to win but since she is not able to edit/update her original post, I would like to say a few things... I had no clue this would blow up like this. I thought I'd get 10 upvotes and send it to her as a joke when she was being obnoxious about having 2500 more karma than me in the span of a day while I've been in here for a year. This has made our day off together one of the best ones in a while. 

That being said, please go show her some of that love I know reddit is so capable of showing. She is truly my better half and deserves all the attention and happy comments.",tifu
TIFU by pretending not to be Korean,"So I'm Korean-Canadian but was born in Canada and have grown up here my entire life. I ""speak"" Korean but it's about at the level of a talented ten year old with a funny Canadian accent.

Fuck-up happened yesterday. I'm walking down the sidewalk and who I assume are a man and his daughter (who appears around my age) are puzzling in Korean over a directory sign. I ask (in Korean) if they need any help. The dad seems excited to meet someone who speaks Korean. The girl seems shy and doesn't say much besides ""thanks."" They're looking for a nearby mall so I offer to walk them over there since the train station I need is nearby anyway.

The dad asks me where I learned to speak Korean so well. This is where the fuck-up begins. I'm pretty insecure about my spoken Korean, so when the dad asks where I learned the language, it sounds like he thinks it's obvious I'm not ""actually"" Korean. It doesn't help that his daughter is ridiculously pretty, and I want to impress her for some reason. So, I lie. Stupid idea. I say I'm actually Chinese and learned Korean on my spare time, changing my skills from ""mediocre for a Korean person"" to ""impressive for a Chinese person.""

Alas, the dad immediately switches to Mandarin which I can't speak a word of. This would have been the time to come clean. Instead, panicking at having been exposed, I do my best confused face and then pretend I misspoke and said the Korean word for ""Chinese"" (Jung-guk) when I in fact meant ""Japanese"" (Ilbon). Ha-ha, sorry, my Korean isn't very good, right?

Of course, the daughter suddenly bursts into fluent and excited Japanese, which I also can't speak a word of. I'm in too deep at this point and can't tell them I'm Vietnamese or some other variety of Asian without making myself even more suspicious, so I do the only logical thing and say I am indeed Japanese but don't actually speak Japanese (but learned Korean cuz lol I'm a traitor to my Japanese heritage).

We reach the mall and I'm all too happy to bail at this point, but the girl, who suddenly seems super interested in me, asks (now in practically perfect English – damn polyglots) what I do. I say I go to the local university. She excitedly tells me that she's starting at the same university in September, and that she has just arrived in Canada from Korea. Her ""dad"" seems just as excited by this news and asks me to take care of her once school starts and he goes back to Korea.

It turns out that the girl is actually Japanese but went to some exchange program in Korea for a few years, and that the ""dad"" is actually her Chinese-born Korean teacher/ sponsor who accompanied her to Canada. So, not only did I pretend not to be Korean to two people who weren't even Korean, but I pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man and have now convinced a Japanese girl that I'm Japanese.

So I exchanged contact information with the girl and we've been talking a lot online since yesterday. Turns out she's super nice and funny and interesting and accomplished. We have a ton in common too. We have the same major, and we're the same age, though she's three years behind me because of her exchange program. She seems super stoked to be friends with me since she doesn't know anybody in Canada and has been talking to me a lot. I'm becoming increasingly aware that I can't pretend to be Japanese forever to this girl and I need to tell her I'm actually Korean, but early on she asked me about my family and I went even deeper into the lie, telling her my parents are from Kyoto (picked a random city), etc. I've done fucked up, Reddit, and I feel terrible about it.

**TL;DR:** Am Korean, pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man, then pretended to be Japanese to an awesome Japanese girl and am now her first friend in Canada (based on a dirty lie).


**EDIT:** OHHH FUCK I THINK SHE JUST ASKED ME OUT BUT I'M NOT SURE AND I HAVEN'T COME CLEAN YET HELP

**EDIT 2 (Night of the 2nd Day):** Thank you all for the sage advice. I have not yet perished of seppuku as some have feared, although it is increasingly seeming the most promising solution. I'm sure she'd oblige me and do the beheading part.
Anyway, I do think we're going on a date tomorrow and I thought I should come clean in person rather than over text. Will keep you all updated (unless I die). I haven't even been on a date in over two years so that's already blowing my mind, especially her asking me out. As some have pointed out, I am kinda concerned that she's only interested in me because she thinks I'm Japanese, but I think that's more to do with her being more comfortable in a foreign country (Canada) when her first friend is a fellow Japanese person. Maybe I'm terrible at social cues and she just wants to hang out as a friend. In any case, I'll explain it all to her tomorrow in the hopes of being a little less of an asshole (there's no solving that completely). Wish me luck in as many languages as you can, Reddit. Gamsahamnida.

Also: they don't use Reddit much in Japan and Korea, do they? I'd hate to be busted via a Reddit thread Q_Q

**EDIT 3 (Still Night of the 2nd Day)**: OH FUCK GUYS I FUCKED UP AGAIN. I was afraid she might stumble upon this post so I asked her if she has heard of Reddit cuz I'm a fucking idiot and she said no, much to my relief, but then she asked if she should check it out and I just realized this is going on the front page at this rate and she's gonna find it somebody order an airstrike on me why am I so stupid.

DON'T LIE, KIDS. LYING IS VERY VERY BAD.

**EDIT 4 (Still Night of the 2nd Day):** Okay I think crisis averted for now. She just went to sleep without any sign of having read this. I'm also going to attempt to sleep and hope I wake up Japanese. Will update. Sayonara, Reddit.",tifu

TIFU by giving an alternative meaning to a (previously) suicidal girl's tattoo.,"Disclaimer: This actually happened several years ago, but I do still feel really bad.

I was out on a date with a girl and things were going well despite me being a nervous wreck. We got to talking and she admitted she had depression and at one point was even suicidal, but was proud of herself for getting past that chapter of her life. She then shows me her semi-colon tattoo on her wrist and explains the significance - that it means the sentence could have ended there, but the author decided to add more. It's all very sweet and heartfelt. Now, I in no way have any issues with mental illness and still feel super guilty about this to this day, but me with a perpetual foot-in-the-mouth syndrome say ""You know in programming it means end"".

She doesn't say anything.

I don't say anything.

Suffice to say I never got a second date.

&#x200B;

TL;DR I told a suicidal girl who semicolon tattoo means ""end"" in programming.

Edit: The popularity of this post is mostly just everyone telling me I'm wrong. Lol. I guess I could have given a better definition, but I also could have shut my big fat mouth. And I did in fact apologize (a bunch). She awkwardly laughed it off.",tifu

TIFU by drinking a 35 year old can of Coke.,"This story actually took place around this time last year, but because it's embarrassing nature, my coworkers haven't stopped reminding me about it. 

Our office does a small secret Santa goft exchange every year, that we typically arrange in November, and give out gifts in December. You write your name on a slip of paper, along with some gift ideas, and whoever gets your name generally gets you some kind of gift, without you knowing who got it for you. The budget for these gifts is $20, so it's not like anyone is getting something super fancy.

Now, generally speaking, I'm pretty indecisive. Ask me what I want for Christmas, I'll probably say I don't know. Ask me what I want within a $20 budget? I definitely have no idea. I remember writing on the slip ""IDK, something cool?"" beneath my name, expecting to maybe get a gift card or something generic. 

When I get to my desk on the day of gift exchange, I see a can of Coke with an image of Santa on the can, sitting beside a card. I remember thinking to myself ""Well, this is what I get for not being specific. May as well be appreciative of what I've been given."" 

I open up the card, which contains an cheesy line, fitting of the sense of humor of the people in my office. ""If you put me in the fridge, I make a ""cool"" gift!"" My eyes scan down the card, and I read the next line. ""P.S. I'm almost twice your age!"" Now, this should have been my first clue. However, being the youngest person at my office (I'm 20), I took this line to be a clue as to who my secret Santa was! After all, half the fun was trying to figure out who got you the gift. Never in a million years would I have thought that line, was to be taken from the perspective of the can. 

So, I crack open the can. As I go to take a sip, I notice the metal on the outside smells off. I'm not sure how to describe the smell, aside from how one might imagine an old garage would smell. This should have been my second clue, but instead I picture someone keeping their soda in a second fridge in their garage, something I had known many of my friend's fathers to do. Of course, these were sodas we weren't allowed to drink, so I rationalize to myself that this particular can perhaps sat in a fridge in someone's garage long enough to soak of some of the, erm, garage smell? After a moment of hesitance, I remember once more that I should be appreciative of the gift, and take a sip. 

Now, it feels important to note here, that I don't really drink Coke. If anything, I drink Pepsi, but I'm not really the biggest fan of dark sodas. I'm generally a Sprite or even Mountain Dew kind of guy. The first sip, as far as I'm concerned, didn't really set off any alarm bells. Maybe I was just in denial, but it wasnt until a few sips in that I truly became aware the soda was... Off. I think to myself that it's the odd garage smell of the can that's got the soda tasting strange, as smell is a big part of taste, right? So, deciding I don't want to offend whoever it was that gave me the gift, I chug down the rest of the can as quickly as possible. 

Now, it isn't until about an hour later that one of my supervisors approaches me, presumably for something unrelated, and looks in absolute horror at the can on my desk. I'm confused of course, until they explain that they collect Coke memorabilia, including some of the older unopened cans with specific designs. They point out the PS on the card that was, apparently meant to indicate the age of the can and not the age of the person... I try to laugh it off, but, the judgement in the eyes of my supervisor is clear. After googling around, I managed to find the exact Santa can. If I recall correctly, it had been about 35 years old, give or take a year.

The bright side is, surprisingly, the soda didn't make me sick at all. The downside is, even a year after the fact, I have yet to live this down. Everyone in the office knows I drank this ancient soda, and even our new hires are quickly filled in. I wouldn't say it's what I'm known for at the office, but it's definitely still present in the minds of my coworkers!

TLDR; someone gave me a collectible can of coke for secret Santa, and not wanting to be impolite at the odd gift of a soda, I drank it.",tifu
AITA for leaving my fiance over his reaction to me getting a student suspended,"I am a librarian at a prek-12 school. I lead one class every period with the younger kids, and high schoolers are free to use the library at any time during the day.

For any women that teach small kids, you know that they grab your boobs. A lot. It's not intentional, my boobs are just eye level for the kids and they often use them for balance or to get my attention. They don't realize what they're doing. Usually I just say ""watch your hands!"" or gently move their hands away, but I don't get mad, because they're little and they don't understand that they're doing something wrong.

One day, I was crouched down next to a 6 year old helping him find a book. He stumbled and grabbed my chest. Again, not a big deal, but one of the 17 year olds in the library saw it happened and yelled, ""LOOKS LIKE MS. aitaitaita IS LETTING THE BOYS COP A FEEL."" I went up to him and told him he was being inappropriate and threaten detention and all that, and he gets lippy (his friends were watching) and reaches out AND GRABS MY BOOB. I could tell from his face that he knew he fucked up as soon as he did it and I took him straight to the office. The principal tore him a new one, and then we discussed it for a bit and decided that a 3 day suspension and a call home was appropriate, since the kid was clearly scared shitless and seemed to both of us to be more of a smartass than a danger to students or other teachers. The suspension will also have to be reported to colleges, which is what my (ex)fiance took issue with.

I told my fiance about it that night and he didn't react as expected. He said that the high schooler was just a kid who clearly didn't realize what he was doing, and it was a double standard to punish him and not punish the younger kids for the same infraction. I pushed back because I think there's a huge difference between being 6 and being 17, and he accused me of being an unfair teacher who was targeting a student because I weighed in on the punishment, and therefore he wasn't treated impartially. He also told me that this being on the kids record was too harsh and he didn't deserve to be marked forever for a ""joke."" I pointed out he should know better, but he just doubled down on telling me I should learn to take a joke and laugh it off and not be such a bitch.

I tried to discuss it several times but he wouldn't budge, and I felt incredibly unsupported and hurt, so I decided to break off the engagement. HIs friends have been reaching out and accusing me of being unfair and rash. AITA?

Edit: thanks for your responses everyone, especially those of you PMing me telling me to kill myself or that I'm an emotional bitch who should listen to the logical men or I will die alone :)))))) love u all",AmItheAsshole

"AITA for telling her to ""Know her place""?","Throwaway account cause several friends know my main account.

&#x200B;

I (F27) have been friends with a guy; Steve since I was 12. There is a group of us - and key point is that I am the only girl. I don't really know 'why' I'm the girl of the group; but I am. Outside of my recent ex; Tom, of 3 years, I have never once liked or been liked by any of these guys. I am not a ""pretty"" girl, and I describe my taste in clothes as 'meh'. I'm not fashion savvy or makeup savvy, etc. Let me say this again - Steve and I have never touched beyond hugging. The most intimate we've gotten was probably him carrying me home when I broke my foot once.

&#x200B;

About 4 months ago, Tom and I broke up, and at the same time Steve began dating this girl Abby. Abby is beautiful and knows all the things that I wish I knew about being a woman. So, upon meeting her, I was warm, friendly and was even asking for fashion advice when I met her. I wanted to be her friend. Abby was quiet, and not as warm, but I put that down to shyness.

&#x200B;

Last night Steve, Abby, Tom, myself and a few others went out for dinner and drinks. I continued being friendly to Abby, while not really having a response to that. I went to the bathroom and when I came out of the stall Abby was standing there waiting for me.

&#x200B;

I'll cut a giant argument short, but Abby accused me of breaking up with Tom to get with Steve and told me that she will do whatever she has to do to get rid of me, stating that it was ""super weird"" that I was the only girl friends with a group of guys, insinuating that I'd slept with all of them, but then also implying that I should have left the group when Tom and I broke up. My response to this was to tell Abby to 'know' her place and that I had been around for much longer than her, and that if anyone was going to be ""gotten rid of"" it'd be her because we had been through the jealous girlfriend situation before and Steve had chosen me, and would never seriously consider a girl that hated his best friend.

&#x200B;

Abby went out and told Steve I attacked her - who didn't believe a word and broke up with her on the spot. Since then, I've gotten messages from Abby's friends on social media to tell me what a whore, bitch, slut, I am and that Steve and I were fucking the whole time. One girl even sent these messages to my family to 'warn' me about what kind of 'slut' I am. My own brother says he feels that I've caused this drama myself by

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Extra info as required:

Holy shit - didn't expect this to blow up the way it did. And I did not expect gold at all - so thanks? 

&#x200B;

Unfortunately I did mean 27 in the post - I failed to mention that Abby is actually 22; but I do highly accept that I could have handled the situation much better; I am NOT a confrontational person. I grew up in an abusive home (in particular from my step-mother and step-sister) and my general response to conflict is tears (which I hate) or just bolting and ghosting a situation. I think being ambushed is why I lost my cool. 

&#x200B;

I read a lot of comments about how this came off as ""not like other girls"". I don't know how to not make it do so. I'm simply not ""good"" at being friends with other girls. I'm shy, awkward, I stumble over my words; and because I \*want\* to be friends with them, it comes off as desperate and overdone. I do have girl acquaintances but it never goes beyond the occasional coffee time. 

&#x200B;

Boundaries - I'm not a touchy-feely person outside of if I'm actually in a relationship or seeking a relationship with someone. Again - childhood abuse. Once we got out of high school and stopped seeing each other as frequently - we do a quick side hug goodbye. 3 of the other guys have girlfriends who all seem to enjoy my company when we are together. 

&#x200B;

Somebody mentioned that I'm obviously into my friends if I got with Tom. Tom and I kissed as a joke once, sensed the chemistry and things went from there. We all thought it was going to be forever - but Tom got some bad health news and put ""us"" on hold until/unless it ends positively. He doesn't want to put me through that. 

&#x200B;

The long version of the argument began with Abby asking why I was wearing such an inappropriate outfit for someone who'd just broken up with someone (jeans, boots and a shirt); I stared at her in shock and said ""what the fuck - what's going on?"" and then she straight away started with the accusations. 

&#x200B;

As a last note - the previous girlfriend of Steve's happened when we were about 16; and when that happened, I stepped back completely and began distancing myself from everyone. It was about 2 weeks before Tom of all people got it out of me and he went to Steve and told him.

TIFU by microwaving a chef boyardee on an active military base,"As with most things this happened last week. I'm currently deployed in the middle east. We got off work a little later than expected and missed the galley hours so we stopped at the mini mart on base to grab some food. They have a decent selection mostly just your typical gas station food. So some guys grab cold sandwiches or microwavable burritos, I decided to go for the chef boyardee classic spaghetti and meatballs. Now you have to heat you food at the mini mart because they don't trust us with microwaves in our rooms. You'll understand why soon enough. I put my spaghetti in the microwave and set the timer.  We are just bullshiting in the mini waiting for our food when all of a sudden a loud bang what sounded like a gunshot goes off behind us and without skipping a beat there were 4 marines M16s raised yelling at everybody to get down as they make their way through the shop clearing the isles straight towards us. That's when I realized I forgot to remove the metal top from the spaghetti. I had to show them the inside of the microwave now covered in spaghetti sauce and meatballs before they finally relaxed and put their guns down. I ended cleaning the microwave and buying a second chef boyardee.





TL;DR I microwaved a chef boyardee with the metal top on creating a small spaghetti bomb surrounded by a bunch of trigger happy marines Creating a really world close quarters drill.",tifu

TIFU by Playing Music for a Sex Dungeon,"I currently live in an apartment building in Seattle. Nearby my unit is a man named ""Frank"" and his girlfriend (who is quite vocal, thus why I know her boyfriend's name). Now Frank and his girlfriend have incredibly loud sex throughout the entirety of Friday and Saturday nights. Annoyed by all of the sound and trying to find a way to blot it out, I began a habit a few months ago of playing music (singing, playing guitar) whenever they would start doing the dirty over the course of the last couple months. As an added bonus, I could hear my neighbors yell ""sing"" throughout the night, so I assumed that my playing was a helpful solution to an unfortunate circumstance borne by all of the other neighbors around me.

&#x200B;

However, tonight, I noticed something kind of strange. They were having sex, per usual, and I began to play music to cover up the sound. I stopped to drink some water between songs, when some of my neighbors started yelling ""play."" For some reason, though, I didn't do anything for a few seconds, and I heard the guy, Frank's, voice call out ""keep playing or I'm not going to cum"" through the walls. I listened a while longer to see if I'd heard correctly, and they both kept moaning the same thing. It was at this point that I came to a terrible conclusion. In my attempts to cover up the sound of them having sex, I managed to pull some weird Pavlovian trick where whenever they had sex, I played guitar and sang. Thus, whenever I started to play guitar to cover up an original sound, it just added to their voyeuristic thrill and they started to depend upon it to finish. When I'd heard my presumed neighbors yell sing, it was actually Frank and his girlfriend. Unsure if I was right, I started playing another song and when I finished, they were going as hard as possible and moaning heavily so I figured that I'd assumed correctly.

&#x200B;

My neighbors them get understandably angry that my music playing has made this neighbor couple have sex, so then ***they*** begin to have really rough revenge sex against my wall because they think that I've caused this problem (which I have). At this point, I'm listening to Frank and his girlfriend and the couple next to my wall, one couple horny and one full of revenge, and all of this was because I tried to save myself from listening to sex in the first place.

&#x200B;

Edit: here's a video I uploaded as proof that I'm actually playing music. They weren't having sex this morning, so everyone will have to leave that part to their imagination.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOP3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOP3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be)

2nd Edit: Wow, this really blew up. Hopefully everyone enjoyed the story! Regarding proof of their sex, I'm not going to record the sound of my neighbors screwing and upload it to the internet, so my apologies there. To answer everyone's questions, the song is an original, but I've never recorded anything professionally and I play as a hobby. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Thought I was covering up sex sounds with music, turns out I was serenading a couple while they fucked and keeping them horny all night. Neighbors had angry sex against my bedroom wall as revenge for disturbing their sleep because I acted as a musical facilitator.",tifu
"[UPDATE] AITA, I flew 1k miles to visit a girl, arrived here and saw another guy has also come to see her but I don't want her to spend any time with him","Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cn59tp/aita_i_flew_1k_miles_to_visit_a_girl_arrived_here/?st=jzismolp&sh=acd7fa42

I got home a few days ago and wanted to give everyone an update. The rest of the week was pretty much the three of us again, except for one other night where we were alone. So essentially in a week we only had two nights out together (I slept in her house so we spent nights alone anyway but I mean going out alone without third wheel).

I decided to do what a lot of you were suggesting and I confronted the other guy about wtf was going on. I guess something didn't feel right and my gut was telling me I should probably talk to him because I felt she was lying. So I went out on a ""walk to the shops"" and ended up at the guy's hotel and room.

Straight up asked him what's going on, it was incredibly awkward but we ended up having a good conversation about her and he basically was told the same as I was. Except she lied and said I purposely told her I couldn't afford a room and she ""had to offer me her place"". This isn't true, she offered me her place from the get-go and I never insinuated I wouldn't get a hotel room. She told him she liked him, was incredibly flirtatious with him too and they actually took it much farther than we did. They had a lot of phone sex, he had her nudes (he didn't show me out of respect for her), and they cammed a lot. A lot more than she did with me. I felt heartbroken, still do but I'm feeling better. On this trip alone they actually had sex when she was at his room, he confirmed it with a text she sent him when she left to go out with me. He does really like her, I'm not sure if she likes him back but she did sleep with him so maybe, She never did strike me as that type of person yet here we are, I told him he could have her.

So yeah. In essence, she lied a lot. She told me she really liked me, told him she doesn't like me at all. Was incredibly flirty with both of us and leading us both on. She told him she didn't want me at her house yet totally invited me to stay there. She told me she didn't like him, he's just a friend visiting, but then turns out she's had a sexual relationship with him for months and they even slept together while I was also there. It's shit.

Shit update and it's 100% what you lot expected and were telling me was gonna happen. Turns out I am really fucking stupid however I'm working on it and you can bet I won't make the same mistake again.

I see a dick. A hard, throbbing cock, staring me right in the eye.

And then it's cumming.  

And after the last bit of cum drops, the camera gets aimed downward and I see my dad's shoes and the tile in our bathroom. 
I just watched my dad shoot his fucking load all over the bathroom tile. This dude filmed himself cumming in the bathroom. 

He moved out a long time ago and obviously forgot that this flashdrive was here. I'm not going to give it back. I'm not going to assert dominance and return the favor. I'm going to burn it with fucking fire.

AITA for surrendering my sister's child to protective services when she forced me to babysit due to mental health?,"I'm 26M, my sister is 28F. We're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. I'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. Despite all of this, we're not particularly close. We live in the same city but I might see her once a year in passing.

To make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. She said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and I was the only person who could help. I couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. She took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. She left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.

It took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. He was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. They took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. I have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. I can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.

I'm just not equipped to handle a kid. My home isn't child proof, I have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. I work full time, I'm in school. I couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. I feel like I let my sister down but first and foremost I believe she let her own child down. I don't know what's going to happen.

Was I the asshole?

**edit**: just so there's more info, I wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. Never mind I don't even have a car. I'll admit I could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.

Child services is what its name implies, here where I live it's called FACS. They work with families in struggling times like this. I told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. They left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because I'm not the parent. Even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.

I didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. I contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. My best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. I don't know anything else beyond my best guess.

And I can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one I contacted can offload the work for me. It's been 8 days and no word on anything: if I took eight days off work with no telling when I could return, I might as well not return.",AmItheAsshole

"AITA possibly over-reacting at my wife's ""mistake"" by leaving the house for a week","I know relationship posts aren't allowed here so I want to keep this focused to the incident at hand. So please don't give any relationship advice.

Okay, so I am a big fan of Seinfeld as I used to watch it every day after school with my dad. I had a poster that was signed by the actors who played the four main characters Jerry, Kramer, Costanza, and Elaine. This poster has always been really important to me because watching seinfield with my dad is one of the few times I got to spend time with him (he had a lot of personal issues) and he personally went and got it signed to give me for my 21st birthday. So yeah, it's not just a dumb poster to me, it has a lot of sentimental value.

Now my wife and I have been trying to raise money to start a college fund for our kids. As you do, we've been selling stuff we don't need anymore, and I guess you can see where this is going. I hadn't been in my study a few weeks as I've been on an extended business trip, and when I come home to my study my poster is gone. I ask my wife where it is and she said she sold it on eBay.

Here's where it gets iffy. She claims she assumed it would be okay to sell since it's just a poster, DESPITE it being so sentimental to me. The reason I am suspect is because she was very unhappy with me going on this business trip. She tried to forbid me going because she couldn't come with me (to make sure I behave myself). However I couldn't say no, I literally had to go or I'd severely hurt my reputation at work. So when I leave we're fighting, when I come back my most prized possession is gone in a ""mistake."" See where I'm coming from?

I told my wife I was going to stay in a motel for 1-2 weeks, and that if she wants to save this marriage my poster better be back in my study when I get back. She's supposedly been an emotional wreck ever since (according to her sister).

"[MA] Landlord wants to fine/evict me for having sex with my partner in my apartment. Cites ""illegal activity"". Does he technically have a case?","So, bit of a weird one, so please bear with me.

I rent an apartment from a man who lives down the street. It's a nice enough apartment and up till now I've had very few issues.

The problem is he's rather... conservative, and I'm rather... gay.

Once he found out that my boyfriend wasn't just a friend who spent a lot of time with me, he tried to bar him from coming over. I told him to ""pound sand"", as it goes.

Now he sent me a letter stating that effective immediately, there shall be a $250 fine every time I ""commit the sin of homosexuality"" in my apartment. If I refuse to sign the addendum, he claims he will file to evict me due to breach of the lease, specifically the clause that the premesis shall not be used for illegal activity.

He cites MA state code that criminalizes fornication (sex outside marriage), and ""crimes against good nature"", which he insists means homosexual relations (the statute does not define it any further). 

I looked them up, and they are evidently real crimes. I know they're not enforceable by any stretch, but have I technically done ""illegal activity"" in my apartment?

I really don't want to move early (lease started in Sept), or have an eviction on my record.

I know this seems absolutely silly, but the fact that they are still technically crimes in the book gives me a little pause.

WIBTA if I record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?,"My neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the TV. I've gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. We have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. They also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. It's actually turning me off sex. I find them insufferable. 

 As petty revenge, I'm considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they're loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. I feel they know I'm mild-mannered, and they're taking advantage - that since I'm not a tough guy or something (I'm a young woman), they don't care.

Recently I found a position at a tech firm that will allow me to work from home, is easier than what I used to do, and pays more. Basically tired of doing nothing even though Im getting paid for it.  

The day after I mailed the keys to the satellite office back to the corporate office I got a phone call exactly at 8 AM. The head of HR for the former company wanted to speak with me in person. I asked her if there were any issues such as equipment that was not returned. She stated that there were no issues like that. They just had some questions about my job function over the last year. 

I told her that they should have that information as head of HR and promptly disconnected stating I had to return back to work. She called back at 12:05 exactly. 

I have been ducking her calls ever since. Her voicemails state that I am required to come into her office to discuss a few things. My emails with her have asked if there is anything that needs to be returned or issues with company property. Each time I am assured it is nothing like that, but that they need me to come into their office to discuss this with me in person. She calls at least once per day. 

I am thinking I just need to ignore her until she either escalates or goes away.

AITA for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?,"First up please know I am trying my best to be kind in my wording. I run a small operation where I guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. I have served all kinds of clients.

I got an inquiry for a group called ""Womens+ Adventures"" and because it was during Pride Month, I thought maybe it was an LGBTQ+ group. I chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and I started the training plan.

The group wanted to work up to ""A 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. Going off what everyone reported, I decided Gray's Peak. One of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

When I arrived for our first group hike, I learned ""Womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than LGBTQ+. No issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

The first hike was... awful. It was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. Several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. When we got started hiking, it was very slow. One woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. One ate all of her snacks after the first break. Lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

After we got back (6 hours later) I pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. She insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that I didn't believe them. When I suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. I gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. Several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd Hike went even worse. I had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. So I called the head and told her that I thought it was best if I refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. Well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that I am fatphobic, I'm mocking them, etc.

Please, PLEASE keep in mind that I have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. I consider myself to be VERY patient. One of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. Simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

I refunded the money and ended contact only to find my Social Media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. You can guess what I was called. I felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me I was an asshole for not powering through, that I should have given them THREE chances, that I should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

I (26 F) used to be a prostitute. Then I met a man who became my friend (36 M) at a cafe. Now I have my GED and am a receptionist.,"I have a child with cystic fibrosis. I would watch him during the day and work at night. My sister lived with us and she would watch him at night. 

I would go to a cafe before I started work for a half hour and have a latte and have time to myself. My friend was there typing on a laptop. We started talking and I found out he came every day to write a book in his spare time and he was in the publishing business. 

I told him I never finished high school and he said he'd help me get my GED. The next day he brought me some books published by where he worked. He helped me study and I passed. 

He helped me get a job as a receptionist.  I can afford better care for my child. 

We are still friends and I have fallen in love with him. I'm not sure if he could ever like me in that way. 

Is it worth asking him if he does or Not? Or do you think that would ruin our friendship?

If they failed to understand the process, I would get angry (not at them, just in general) and they would see it as a critique of their intelligence. The discussion would quickly turn into an argument and in the end everyone would just hate the new dishwasher. 

So I started acting like it was my failure to explain the situation...even if it wasn't. It totally changed the tone of my voice and made the person I was talking to more receptive to my instructions.

"The word ""retarded"" shouldn't be offensive","The fact that society is shying away from ""the r-word"" is proof of the so-called euphemism treadmill. Basically, by replacing ""retarded"" with something else, we're just kicking the can down the road and it's a matter of time before the new word becomes offensive. 

Not that long ago, the term ""retarded"" was considered a kind and politically correct way to replace words like ""idiot"" and ""imbecile"" (those were actually medical terms 75 or so years ago). 

The term ""special"" or ""special needs"" is probably the most common way of replacing ""retarded,"" but even those terms are becoming offensive (for example, conservatives sometimes derisively call progressives ""special snowflakes""). 

Obviously human decency should prevent us from making fun of those with mental disabilities, but it just isn't necessary to tip-toe around those clunky terms that become offensive after a few years.

I was pulled over for speeding and the officer borrowed my pen and made me give it back to him claiming it was his.,"Hi all, I'm in Florida and was pulled over for going 30 over the speed limit. I was perfectly nice to the officer, and apologized for my speed. He asked for my license and asked if the address on it was current, I told him no, that I had recently moved. He then asked me to write down my current address. I happened to have post it notes and pens in my middle compartment. I wrote down my address, gave him the post-it note and he then asked for my pen.(I don't know at this point if he knew he was borrowing mine, or if he thought it was his).

Update to my husband wants a white name,"Not really sure if anyone is interested but we talked it out

He felt like the baby would look 100% like me and nothing like him and he was feeling left out. He said she wouldn't feel like his baby if she looked completely like me and had a name that I chose and that he had no part in. That's it. He's not racist or disgusting and doesn't want an arab baby. So I reassured him that we have no idea how she'd even look. But I know what he means. He really had to accommodate all these years which I am so so appreciative of, he did not have to do that, he could have taken the easy way out and dumped me for someone that didn't require so much effort. But he learned to love our foods and learned literally 5 words of Arabic to show my family and impress them with lol

And he's not racist at all, he is an amazing guy and I'm so lucky to be with him. 

So we're gonna find our names together. If we both agree on an ""American"" name, it's fine. She really is gonna be surrounded by her arab heritage so much with our big family and everything, if a name helps him feel more connected to our baby, it's all his.

My car was stolen. Police found a 16 year old driving it but say they can't charge him because there is not enough evidence. Thief is the son of a city councillor [California],"My car was stolen out of my driveway. I came out in the morning to find my car gone and some broken glass in the driveway. I called the police and filed a report.

Last week the police called me and told me the car had been found and said that I could come and pick it up. I picked it up from the police station but the clutch and the transmission were fried (it's a manual) and I had to get it towed back to my house because I couldn't drive it. The police told me they caught someone driving it and they were working on the case.

Besides the window being broken and the clutch and transmission being fried the car reeked of marijuana and had empty beer bottles all over the floor. While I was cleaning it I found a cell phone under the seat. It was unlocked and it had notifications up. I brought the phone to the police figuring that it would help their case. This is where it gets weird.

The officer took the phone but told me there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone with anything so I should just cut my losses and move on. I didn't understand how this was possible because they told me they caught someone driving it and the report they sent to my insurance company confirms this.

I called the police again and kept getting the run around so finally I asked to speak to a supervising officer. The supervising officer told me they didn't have enough evidence on ""John Smith"" to charge him with anything. I don't think it's a coincidence that ""John Smith"" is the son of a city councillor. The supervising officer told me that the case was closed and I should leave this alone.

Is there anything I can do to get them to charge him? He was found driving my car that I have on video being stolen. His phone was found in my car, the window was busted, the transmission and clutch were fried, the car smells like marijuana and had 36 beer bottles on the floor. The bill to fix my car is going to be a fortune. I know that if he wasn't the son of a city councillor he would already be in jail. Also despite having a clean driving record and no criminal record I have been pulled over 4 times since I got my car back while driving my rental. All 4 times it was just so the police could ""check my documents"". A strange guy in a suit also came to my house and has sat in a car outside my work. He never says anything to me he just smilies and waves. The police say he isn't breaking any laws by being in public.

What can I do about this? Can I talk to the state police or the FBI if the local police won't help?

Edit: Case was in Federal Court, Louisiana.


Edit 2: since the update threads are locked by default, I'm going to add here my advice for others in similar situations, since it appears to be a common question in the PMs I'm getting.


First: look really hard into getting a lawyer, even if only for initial settlement negotiations. A lawyer MAY get your case dismissed in the incipient phase. The initial month I used a lawyer gave me the general direction I followed after. It helped me discover some of the tools I needed to use later. Unfortunately, my former employer got stubborn and it became a pissing contest. 

Things I've learned and I recommend: Read (download) the Rules of civil procedure, and the local court rules. Do not let deadlines pass! Better file something incorrectly than not file, when an answer or action is expected of you. You will have the chance to fix errors later. Have a witness(es) willing to write a declaration stating that your version is correct. Use affidavits/declarations to get your evidence admitted. Also - read the Rules of evidence!

Submit subpoenas, and take depositions! This is what ultimately helped me!

Good luck, all! ",legaladvice
AITA for telling cashier that wasn't the girls credit card?,"
Throwaway because husband told me I was TA and want to know before I get home and argue. On phone format is bad.

I was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. One of the girls had picked out a pair of VERY expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. Second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she's really gonna spend that much on boots. Girl with boots says something along the lines of ""it's fine I have my dads credit card I'm not paying "" which instantly caught my attention because THATS NOT HER CARD. I've told my son multiple times he's never allowed to use my card so I'm interested to see how this girl thinks she's going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

We end up at the same register (me behind) and I see her total hit well over four digits. The girl is about to swipe her card when I decide that I can't let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. I tell cashier that isn't her card but her father's and I'm not sure she has permission. Girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look I've ever seen. I swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, I don't think she was ever told no.

Girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it's the stores credit card and it gives him the points. Now that I've pointed out it wasn't hers cashier tells her she can't use that card. Girl tries to show ID to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and I tell her it's still fraud. Girl says it's not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. I tell her that it is my business that she's doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or I call the cops. Girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. She uses her own card and leaves crying. Cashier looks mad at me and I tell my husband when I get home only for him to agree I was in the wrong.

AITA for sending an explicit video my ex sent to me to hurt me to her family,"Hi AITA. I am going to try to make this as brief as possible so I don't ramble.

&#x200B;

I dated Em for a year and a half. During this time I confided in her some personal secrets, which I don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. Because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that I am very sensitive towards.

&#x200B;

We did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. I broke up with her because I found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. Recently I found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. She basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information I shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.

&#x200B;

I sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. She replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. That was the last straw for me, and I sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that ""this is what Em sends me when I ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.""

&#x200B;

Her familly is quite religious and they lost it. Apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. AITA?

&#x200B;

TL:DR my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. I sent them to her family. AITA?

&#x200B;

Edit: Well this blew up. I'll try and answer some of the things I have seen asked most often here:

&#x200B;

1: I feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that I have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. To put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, I was a victim of CSA for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. It led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that I struggle with to this day (I never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that I've done that I'd like to not have spread around). She has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.

&#x200B;

2: By all of her friends and family, I meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. I worded that terribly. I have not been in the best headspace as of late. Sorry.

&#x200B;

3: We have not spoken since. I have no desire to speak to her ever again. My coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and I have not heard anything from him. As petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all I care. I have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. Maybe I am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. I feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.

&#x200B;

4: I will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. I have the money to fight a legal case if I have to, though obviously, I would rather not.

&#x200B;

yeah. that pretty much the main things I wanted to clear up. I'll go through the thread tomorrow if I feel up to it and see if there's anything else. It's a bit of a shitshow and I'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",AmItheAsshole

AITA for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?,"Context: So a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called ""Jan"". I am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. I'm a tall and lanky male at 6'1 and 155lbs. Jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


Recently, we had a watch party at Jan's apartment for the Michigan Football Bowl Game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. My buddy and I were talking about whether our QB should declare for the draft or return. I said ""I sure hope he comes back, Dylan (our backup QB) is still young and is still pretty scrawny."" 

Jan has a huge crush on Dylan and didn't appreciate that I called him skinny. 

This caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying ""what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you're literally built of twigs?"" ""You would die playing football. Tbh I don't think you could even lift a helmet!"" 

At first, I took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. I usually got my leg pulled about my physique but I never took it personally. Until she started making it personal.

""Look at you, you're like one of those starving African kids on those TV commercials""  (I'm brown but not African)
""That's why Dylan is a chick-magnet and [my ex] dumped you. You look malnourished""

She kept going and now I was beginning to boil. I wasn't even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. But then I snapped.

Her: ""Go lift some weights. It's okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.""

Me: ""If you could tell me what your current diet is, I'm sure I'll put on weight in no time.""

*silence*

Her: ""What are you trying to say?""

Me: ""I'm saying that if I'm a malnourished African then you could be on The Biggest Loser. And I'm pretty certain you wouldn't win.""

Her: ""No wonder [ex] didn't want you. Go fuck yourself.""

Me: ""And no guy wants you. The last dick you got was Moby Dick. Fucking whale.""

At this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. Her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

Since this was at Jan's place, I figured I should leave (Michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). I finished my beer and left. I got a FaceTime from one of my friends who is Jan's roommate. She urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and I went too far. I didn't feel that way and I don't want to apologize.

Should I (48m) tell my wife (44f) that I received a sex tape of her in the mail?,"Throwaway.

This is an odd thing. Wife and I have been married 20 years. I've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

First of the year, I receive a package in the mail. It's a DVD addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". It's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. She was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

First I've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the DVD - none of which I know. I'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. Second I've know idea why they sent it. Are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? The tape isn't time stamped so I don't have a frame of reference. She kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

And also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? I know my wife had other partners. Hell I had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago I think we're past that. But apparently this person or persons isn't.

The whole thing is strange. I'm not sure what's going on. I haven't told my wife, I'm not sure how she would take it. She's very sexual and adventurous but I don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. But I don't think I'll get to the bottom of this unless I tell her.

EDIT - update. I'm overwhelmed by the responses. Thank you for your interest.

I did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. Some mentioned letting her watch it in private and I gave her that option. She did and we talked at length. Some of it is a bit clearer now.

The two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. That's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  I asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

The other is a boyfriend she dated when her and I met, before we actually started dating. She knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

Why?

She admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on Facebook. When she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. She thinks he sent the DVD to cause an issue with us.

For the first time I now have doubts. Her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. And honestly I may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - I know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. Also she didn't seem shaken by the DVD or the fact I had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. I had the idea she'd rather I didn't have it but now that I did, oh well. 

It still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the DVD was made in 2013 but I'm just getting it now? That many be minor but it may be everything. Plus how does this gentleman know where I live - Facebook doesn't give you that information. Being in contact with someone does so now you see why I have doubts.

Thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. I love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. I will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

EDIT II - I want to clarify something. I've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that I'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. None of my business, it was 20 years ago I should man up, that sort of thing.

Look, i said it was hard to take. Most men understand their partner was with different people before them. But SEEING their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. I didn't say I was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. It's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. I'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. And for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" I challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. Frustrated at best. You won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. So thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position I'll ignore you thank you very much .

FINAL EDIT - this will be my final edit. Thank you all for your support but all I will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. I hacked into my wife's Facebook account - childish and immature I'll admit but I did it nonetheless. And I found things disturbing enough that I need to think long and hard about what I do next. I've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and I'm questioning her more than ever before. Heartbroken is putting it mildly. It's time for me to work on my life and my self. Thanks to everyone and their interest .",relationship_advice

Sure be upset with the Confederate War flag, or the actual CSA country flag because it is directly related to pro-slavery sentiments. I get that. Are they upset with the Union Jack (The flag of the UK) when they were the ones to set up the colonies and the slave system in the colonies? No, just try to start a fight.

WIBTA if I back out of donating my kidney to my ex-fiancee's brother after my ex-fiancee and I broke up?,"For five years I dated a girl I'll call Mia. We got engaged last March and were supposed to get married next year, but two weeks ago I learned that our entire relationship was a lie. Someone showed me a dashcam recording of her saying that she still loves her ex and she was only with me because I'm the better choice. I confronted her, she admitted it was true, I called off the wedding and broke up with her.

I'm determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that I should have achieved had Mia not wasted five years of my life. But there's an issue that has me on the fence: I was supposed to donate my kidney to Mia's brother Tom, and now I don't know if I should do it.

Tom has ESRD and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. I'm not that close to him and I was only going to do it because I wanted to help Mia's family in any way I could because I though they were going to be m family. But now that I know that she was just playing me the whole time, I'm having second thoughts. Organ donation is a big deal, I will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point I don't want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.

My parents chose their new families over me so I moved in with my aunt. Now they want back in. But I hate them,"Hi.

So I 16. Moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

My father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. My mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

After all that I became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that I didn't exist and play happy family.

After a year I became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home I would never interact with anyone. Both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. I wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon I was labeled as the black sheep of the family. Every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. I was just so fed up that I packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. I took a bus and went MIA for 4 days. Ofcourse the police was called and when I appeared again I hit another lecture.

We got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and I told them I hated them. I called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

In the car I could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

Neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. We informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

My parents ways half assed our contact. Appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. Recently they tried to build more contact up but I was not interested.

I won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did I invite them to the celebration. And on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. I didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. Basically I have cut them out of my life.

I am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

Mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. She got upset and called me crying and..... I just didn't care. It was like listening to a TV character cry. It wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

Dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again I didn't care.

As far as I am concerned my aunt is my only parent. She encourages that I build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

Anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. Mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. They tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and I just said no and left. I still resent them for choosing a new life over me. But I don't know if I am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. I don't want them in my life but would I be making the right choice? ""idk

Edit : because people think o just made it up and I am a moody teen

You know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? That was the feeling I constantly had at their houses.

I know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. My parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. But not in the sense ""I want to have her longer"" but ""I took her last weekend! It's your turn"".

Also planing fun activities for the day after I leave. My father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

Every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

Also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. They had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

They shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

When there are family functions I am often excludes. E.g my dad had a family BBQ and didn't invite me 

They forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar Starbucks gift card even when they know I don't like Starbucks. 

So no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",relationship_advice

Update: Today I (18M) found out my best friend (18F) knows i'm in love with her,"\[Original post\] ([https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bbm8hz/today\_i\_18m\_found\_out\_my\_best\_friend\_18f\_knows\_im/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bbm8hz/today_i_18m_found_out_my_best_friend_18f_knows_im/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x))

So today at school I decided to talk to her and see what made her do what she did. And I must say i was sure surprised when she said it was just something that other people have told her and she was curious if it was true. So naturally I asked her why and she literally told me ""just because"". So then I asked her if she was aware of how uncomfortable that made me feel and how it hurt my feelings to which she just said ""sorry"". After that I really just lost it and went home to sleep. It really didn't go as i planned or wanted it to go, but i did learn some things if nothing else. My until recently ""best friend"" isn't really the best nor even a good friend. How blinded could i have been? Anyway, her behavior answered some of my questions without even having to ask them and i'm pretty sure I just wanna stay away if I can and distance myself now. And yeah that makes me mostly angry than anything else but I can only hope these emotions will go away slowly. I guess those damn romcoms are a lie after all :)

I suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. I managed to procure specimen in question. What do I do now?,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit. Sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and I don't know what to do. Let me break down some background first:

&#x200B;

My dad is currently dying of liver failure. He's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  We have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. The man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. He's taking light doses of morphine and Lorazepam so that he can sleep. The consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to Thanksgiving....

&#x200B;

My step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  There was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (My dad would be the 5th man)

She's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. NOT through any Vet or other official. She is barred from EVERY animal shelter and adoption agency in the STATE as a result.

So with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200B;

She brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. He was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. In a matter of LESS THAN A MINUTE after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction I've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. Before I even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""Do you see the light yet??? Do you see all the pretty angels??"" (WTF????). He's been in an essentially catatonic state since. Out cold for the past 12 hours. It was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. In tears, I begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. I was truly scared and genuinely thought I was going to lose him right then and there. We called Hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. They are on staff 24/7). She wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

But he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and NOTHING like this has ever happened. I'm just a lay person, but that did NOT seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened IMMEDIATELY following the food, like flipping a light switch.

Maybe I'm crazy. Maybe i'm reading too much into it.  But I managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. My first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? Is that even a thing? Do I take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? A hospital?

With him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

&#x200B;

Again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, I probably wouldn't think anything of it....

Any and all feedback would be much appreciated. I'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",legaladvice

TIFU by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging,"Happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

I was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. I noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

Normally, I wouldn't think twice about it, but I was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. Plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

We pull up to a stop light, and I hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. Apparently he didnt see me, because when I said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

Being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, I let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

As I turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. The way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

As I'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. It didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

She then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as I'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. The way she viewed it, I was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

The cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

TL;DR I stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

Edit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn't a semi or tanker truck. It was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford F-350",tifu
Update to My (22F) twin (22F) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. Don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23M) of 8 months.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dckm1r/my_22f_twin_22f_has_slept_or_tried_to_sleep_with/

So I've made a lot of changes in my family life since I posted this a couple weeks ago. I first told everything to my boyfriend. He was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. He also respected that I didn't want her to meet him. 

I decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. She IMMEDIATELY noticed like within ten minutes after I'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so I didn't beat around the bush, I said yes because I didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. She tried to guilt trip me about how I hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like I knew they would). She exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but I hadn't even gotten a chance to say I was worried she'd do this. She said it first so what does that say?

I told her I flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. She called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. I can't reason with her. She just never sees the problem with anything she's done. The way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

I blocked her number, I still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. But we live hours apart, so I figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

Then, as for them, I also got a call from my mom soon after I blocked my sister who wanted to know what I was doing because she was upset. She'd already heard my sister's side which was just that I'd blocked her out of nowhere. So I tried to tell her my side. I did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like I said in the first post I'm not going to fall to petty revenge. I just want her to stop interfering in my life. So all I said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys I've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. My mom then wanted to know what I meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). She also got my dad on the call at this point. I told them the details didn't matter. She kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if I had been having premarital sex. It was really frustrating. 

I told them the point I'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. They began saying I should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. Well I'm not exactly fighting. I'm simply not going to be in contact with her. To them it's the same thing. 

Then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. I said I wasn't going to do that, that I'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. They said they'd come to me then. That brought up how they show up for random visits even when I've said I don't like it. I told them I didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again I wouldn't let them in or talk with them. So they flipped out, that was fun, I got to hear all how I'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

I ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. And blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

I don't know wtf I'm going to do about them. They did threaten to stop paying for my college if I cut them out of my life. I unblocked them to say I want to be in touch with them and do love them but I can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. I said if they stop doing that then I'm happy to have a relationship with them. They had a million reasons why I'm in the wrong. I couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. So I don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

My boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. He thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. He's really helped keep me as sane as I can be. 

Overall I just feel really shitty. I wish any of them would ever listen to what I say. But if they won't then what can I do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. It just sucks it has to be so...final, I guess. I wouldn't mind a middle ground like PLANNING a visit with them ONCE IN A WHILE, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than I do. 

TL;DR: I'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",relationship_advice

"TIFU by knocking up a girl on the first night, but wait","Title says it all. I met her through Tinder, the condom broke but she said not to worry because she's on the pill. Fast forward a week, where I see her for the second time, and she tells me that she's pregnant. Boring story, I know. Now for the fun part. I saw self harm scars on her arm, but only on the second night (she insisted on having the lights off on the first night). She then proceeded to tell me that those were from her two previous abortions, where she was so tortured about it that she had to do this. And that now she probably couldn't handle a third abortion and that anyways she actually knows how to kill herself this time. My heart fucking sank, man. She's now coming over and will be here in an hour, so that we could continue talking. We barely slept because we were talking about it and she says she's 70% sure she wants to keep the baby, but that she wouldn't ask any help from me, except seeing the baby once in a while. I can barely believe what I'm typing right now. I bought two early pregnancy tests, the expensive kind. I don't know what to do. Any advice?

​TL;DR I knocked up a girl on the first night seeing her, the crazy came out on the second night a week later with the news, and she's 70% sure she wants to keep it. Send help.

UPDATE: Holy shit I dodged the biggest fucking bullet ever, I feel like Bullet Bill just zipped passed my cranium.

So she got here and just acted all cool, asking about my day and stuff. She then went on to explain how she felt all bloated and preggo and I just couldn't believe the amount of bullshit coming out of her mouth. I cut her off and told her I didn't believe in the timing of things (I had looked it all up before she got here) and said that I needed actual proof.

Her being a nurse, she insisted that she had access to blood test that could detect HCG levels only four days after conception, which I knew was bullshit. She was so manipulative, she kept on saying that ""she's in medical, so she just knows better"". And I just kept bringing up the 11-14 days period of time after conception needed to take a relevant blood test.

In the end I just told her that she was a bad liar and that her manipulation attempts were in vain. So I told her to leave, now. She called a friend to pick her up and then just stared at me, smiled and said that she would wait there, in my living room. And then the show began.

She said, among other things, ""Why would I ever lie about being pregnant, I'm 21!"" ""You should be ashamed of making me feel like a dirty slut!"" ""How could I even be pregnant from another guy, you're the only guy I've been with recently"" ""Oh, by the way, I already have a son, I know how these things work"". Gems.

Her still being in my living room, I told her to leave or I'd call the cops. She smiled the sassiest smile at me, so I did. After some more back and forth she eventually went outside on the steps while saying how much of a white guy kind of thing I was doing by calling the cops (she is half carribean half european, but basically black).  I closed the door with an intentionally loud sigh. FIN

Anyways, thanks for the support everyone, it truly helped me.

​Update #2:(Album) [https://imgur.com/a/LNdqtsS](https://imgur.com/a/LNdqtsS)

Update #3: So I'm staying as far away as possible. Haven't had contact with her since theses texts. Now for timeline clarification; we met for the first time last Tuesday, and again Monday night. She said she wanted to get a hold of me during the weekend to tell me about it, which implies a test on Friday, not even 72 hours after ""conception"". She then changed her story saying she got the test on Sunday to try to make it more believable timewise I guess. She insisted that she's pregnant and that it's mine. So she basically announced all of that to me 6 days after we first met. When I asked for her to take the test for me she flat out refused, citing disrespect on my part. Oh and the last kicker? Right before leaving she said ""That's why I shouldn't have told you, all guys react the same"". Now please refer to me as Neo.",tifu

Update. Caught my wife cheating. What about her kids.,"TL;DR I informed the ex that we would divorce and made arrangements for visitation.

Sorry this update might be jumbled I originally updated in the wrong sub. This is the umpteenth time I have written this out, each time it's shorter. I not sure how to cross post so I am retyping, bear with me. Last week was a busy week with daughter grad., moving her home, kids sports starting, lawyer, and the first face to face with wife. 

Got home Sunday, put daughter's stuff from apt. In garage. I get a call early evening from 14 yr. old. ""Dad what's going on. No one is talking to us. Mom and grandma are crying grandpa's yelling. Is this because of what I told you?"" I assured him that his mom made a bad mistake, that he had nothing to do with this mess. He asked if I was packing up there stuff because he saw the Uhaul in the driveway. I explained what happened and that all their stuff was remain there.

Monday and Wed. were sports nights. Family sits in bleachers while I stand behind home plate backstop. My usual spot since I don't see eye to eye with FIL. On the way across the field the oldest stops his warm up and rubs over to me. We hug and talk a few minutes then send him back. As I get my spot I have a 10 year old crash into me at full speed. I bend down hug and kiss him all over as he is squirming away. My FIL asks if we could talk. We step away from earshot. He apologizes for the way he has treated me in the past and that he was wrong. Well a little late but I accepted and said I knew that it was hard thing for him to do. He invited me to sit with them, I declined. He asked if I wanted to talk to wife. I said Thursday would be better, do we set tinne and place.

Tuesday comes meet with lawyer. I told him the whole story, he knew from his partner but wanted to hear from me. He asked what I wanted to do. I wanted to stay with the boys then stay married. The boys were most important.  He stated in his experience that the marriage would be a charade and not good for the boys. We could work out a visitation if wife is welling. As far as support he said I could do what I wanted for the boys. Not to give her anything for me to control. The prenup was solid, she violated conditions, no support. He cautioned though that judges around the country have in some instances ordered child support in my case due to being in their lives so long. He did not think our judges have ruled that way in tgge past but you never know. He was sure her attorney would seek support. He suggested that we try to agree on everything we could before court, the the judge would look favorably on us.

Before leaving he told me that every Monday morning the partners meet to discuss new and on going cases. My previous attorney started out describing everything. Each partner has a specialty. Estate Planning/Elder Law, Criminal, Liability, Family. Later in tgge pm the criminal lawyer meets up with my attorney. After the meeting he called a contact in the prosecutors office. The $15000 did not seem right. How do folks in the middle class have 15000 in cash laying around. Turns out ex did not abandon them he was in jail. He was released 3 yrs. ago, when Feds were releasing nonviolent criminals to ease overcrowding, etc. He was sure the police would be interested if he was back and practicing his profession again. But he did not have any other info but the jail time.

Thursday I meet with with and FIL. I asked if they minded if I recorded so there would be no misinterpretation latter. They agreed. Before we started wife wanted to talk privately.  FIL moved to another room. Wife started to apologize. I cut her off. I said before you say anything know that I know a lot more than you think. I asked how long the sex, she said the one time. I told her the video shows that is not true. I played a clip of her dusting the TV. She never saw the camera. I know it was only a few days but she was going to lie so I was too. She thought it was part of the video game. It's not big but it is obvious on top of tv. She admitted since March almost right away! I told her no more lies! I told her of the family secret, that he was in jail not running away. She admitted to this also. I asked how long in contact, since Feb. I asked if she met up anytime before him appearing she said no. I then told her he had been out for 3 years.  The look on her face told me she did not know.

We get FIL back in. Turn on recorder. I asked if she had a lawyer? No. Told her to get one because a divorce will happen. They both asked if something along reconciliation could take place, I said no. I said I wanted the boys, she could live with ex. I told her when speaking privately that ex tried to sell me the boys. I repeated for FIL. We settled on the boys could see me anytime within reason, she would not keep me from them. I said I would provide at my choosing. She would get no support. I did not want her getting the boys to ask me for things, they would be honest if I asked.

AFAIK in  most parts of the US and UK, Nutritionists *can* get some sort of certification and higher ed training, but its not generally required, and its not as regulated as a Dietitian or Registered Dietitian.  In almost all cases, anything like ""Diet Coach"" or ""Nutrition Coach"" or ""Heath Coach"" or ""Nutritional Specialist"" are bs terms. Main takeaway from this LPT is do your research on your own country or state's rules, and be careful who you trust.


3) I'm not intending to imply that there aren't any Nutritionists with 4 year degrees, graduate degrees, or proper training. Just saying rigorous education & certification is not always required, unlike Dietitian, which is a regulated & protected term almost universally. I'm sure there are some great, knowledgeable Nutritionists and Nutritional Therapists out there...and some terrible quack Dietitians. Again, do your research and be careful who you trust.

My manager said I have to straighten my hair,"I work at a high-end retail store in Ontario. I am a 19 year old black female. I started working at the start of May while 18.  I am the only black person and the youngest by far. My other coworkers are white, asian and post-grad. I am the only one with hair like mine.

The only reason I got hired was because I speak french. We get a lot of french-speakers in our store for some reason, and I'm the only one able to assist them.

I have curly hair so I normally do a half up, half down. But usually just leave it out because all my other coworkers don't tie their hair back either. I did slick it down into a bun during my interview and training. The slick down bun put strain on my edges and started to cause breakage.

My manager sat me down for a serious talk. She basically told me I had to wear my hair straight or *at least* slick down into a bun. That they have an image to sell and standard to uphold, they can't do that if I'm 'running around the store looking like a teenager.'

I told her that I can't straighten my hair because it will seriously damage it and gelling it down everyday will make it break off.  She told me that I have to abide by the appearance guidelines or I'll get written up.

I wish I did point out the double standards and hypocrisy. But in that moment I felt very small and didn't have the courage. When explaining what happened to a sibling and parent, they said I was being discriminated against and it's unacceptable. I don't know about HR or if we even have an HR in our store.

I remember when I first learned about the appearance guidelines it said only no unnatural colour.

Am I being discriminated because of my race and age? Is hair protected? I don't know. I feel targeted for my ""ethnic"" hair and """"young""""age

Sorry I'm on mobile, but this is the original post


So this fuck up is only like 10 hours old.

This morning, I was at the airport to head back to school. I look ahead in the security like an I see Joel McKinnon Miller AKA Detective Scully from Brooklyn Nine-Nine. My sister takes a picture of us and I'm on my way. While waiting for Coffee I decide to post the picture on the subreddit. I get on my flight and it's at 100 or so upvotes. I land and I'm at 4K updates and have a whole slew of comments congratulating me for coming out. I go and look back at the title of the post and find out I said ""came out to him"" instead of ""came up to him."" I'm at 25.4k upvotes now and am still getting comments on people congratulating me for coming out...


Also most of my swim team knows about the post and now I'm never living down the whole ""accidentally came out on the internet"" thing...

TL;DR- Met a celebrity, ended up accidentally coming out to the entire internet

TIFU by letting my parents have access to my bank account and student loan money.,"Backstory- My parents wanted me to learn responsibility with money when I was in middle school so they opened a bank account for me with a debit card. They have complete access to it and can take out or add money if they want to. Multiple times while in high school I had money saved up in my account and they took huge chunks out because they ""needed it."" I was paid back in increments when they took large amounts of money out but I still don't think they have fully paid me back for all the money they took. 

Fast forward to now and I still haven't learned my lesson of keeping my money in a separate account that they don't have access to. I have to take our student loans to pay for school (tuition, rent, utilities, food, etc). I had $4000 in student loan money in my account last month and I get a text from my mom saying she transferred all that money to her account so she could pay my rent in advance for the next couple months. I didn't understand why she did that because I've been paying my monthly rent just fine but I said okay and didn't think twice about it until yesterday. 

My rent is due the first of each month and if my mom would have prepaid my rent, I should not have gotten a notification to pay it. But I did get a notification and I was confused. I logged online to look at my account and it said I needed to make a payment. I thought it was just an error or something so I called the 24 hour hotline and they told me there was no payment ever made. I confronted my mom about this and she said ""oh crap I forgot to pay it! Let me go pay it real quick."" I was relieved but only for a little bit. She came back later and told me my dad spent all my loan money on bills and Christmas gifts because he thought it was theirs. She told me she is sorry but they don't have the money right now to pay me back because they don't have any extra money leftover after Christmas. So now I have come up with enough money to pay my rent and utility bill and am out $4000. I doubt I will ever see anything close to that $4000 again.

TL;DR - Parents have access to my bank account and mom took out my $4000 in loan money to pay my rent. Dad spent all the money and they can't pay me back. I'm out $4000.  

Edit - I have since created a new checking account online at a different bank and will be moving what money I have left into the new account and will be adding my direct deposit to the new account. Thank you all for the advice so far and the support!

Edit 2 - I am overwhelmed with the number of people who have PM'd me offering advice, kind words, and even offering me money or starting a gofundme. I'm amazed how much people would do for a complete stranger and can't express my gratitude enough. However, I was smart enough with my money last semester and have enough saved up to still pay my rent. I never thought I would need a rainy-day fund so soon haha. But I am okay and it would feel wrong to accept any of your money. You all are an example of how much good is in this world.",tifu

So how exactly did the playboy mansion work? Did Hugh Hefner just hire attractive women to come in and live there? I don't understand. Also why do some people hate Hugh Hefner so badly?,"I'm young (21 years) and maybe i missed when playboy was a big thing. I know what it is but i don't know much about backstory. But even after looking it up i don't get some things. 

So basically how did the playboy mansion work? So a bunch of hot girls were selected to live with Hugh Hefner for a selected amount of time and get paid for it? 

I saw a post in the ""askwomen"" sub and they were all about how Hugh Hefner is a gross misogynistic guy who exploited women with the playboy magazine. This confuses me because it was my understanding that he did not force women to do the things women did for playboy. IIRC these women in the playboy magazine and playboy mansion were consensually choosing to pose nude (which is not a bad thing: your body, your choice, do you) and be in the mansion. So why do some people hate Hugh so badly? Like what exactly did he do? And also how did the playboy mansion work?

AITA for making Gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?,"So, I've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. But basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

I've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

Well, it didn't stop. 

Anyway, since I'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, I've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until I kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

The noises are kind of, like, SKREEEEEEEOOOOOOOASH! SKREEEEASCCHHHHH! followed by snorts and the like.

So far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what I'm doing downstairs. I brush it off like it's no big deal and I really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. His audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor Gargoyle rears its ugly head.

UPDATE 2.5: There's been lots of debate about whether the sling is allowed or not. AA told me: 1) Yes, medical devices are allowed. 2) I am protected under ACAA and ADA. 3) Technically on AA you don't need to always make a ""special request"" to allow the device. In most cases, you can just tell the crew that it's a medical device and they should understand. But for extra safety it helps to make a note on your profile about it. 4) There should be no obstructive items in the way during takeoff and landing. However this particular AA representative said that the sling is ""not an obstructive item"".

Amazon link for the curious: https://amzn.to/36xbjY3


UPDATE 2: AA called me, apologized for the FA ""escalating out of control"". They will open an internal investigation. I conveyed that I don't want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 But that it's up to AA to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. I don't want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

She assured me that I won't get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me. 

**I did not ask for compensation and told her that I'm NOT here on a vengeance.** Not here to make money or fame from AA. Nope. Did not make a dime from this and don't plan to. I will not be responding to media inquiries. https://imgflip.com/i/3f8i7p 

For those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - I'm a 120lb girl lol. I injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

Forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. Around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. It's just that I talked back (""no I don't but okay"") and I regret that so much.

As we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

""The police will contact you when you get home. You will be banned from future flights."" 

""Ok."" 

""Oh I hope so."" As she walked away. 

I burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. She won. 

There was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my Miranda rights. I made it home in one piece. Still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future AA flights. I've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. My Thanksgiving and Holiday flights are both on AA. 

My seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. They gave me their business card in case I need a witness. 

Thank you again for your helpful comments. I am not in jail (yet) at least!

Original post: 

I can't believe this is happening to me. I'm flying from Chicago to Boston now and police are waiting for me when I land, so I don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

Edit: I've looked all over the internet and can't find any FAA rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

Here's what happened:

..

I was on an American Airlines flight from Chicago to Boston on November 3rd, 2019. Because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, I use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. This sling is often advertised on Facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

Right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. I am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""You have to put your feet on the ground!"" I cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""No I don't but okay."" As I put my feet down. Emphasizing again. **I complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** Although I had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights I've taken with my foot sling, I complied. I put my feet down immediately. 

Even if it's technically not allowed by some rule I'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

She immediately escalated: 
""Would you like to go back to the gate? We're gonna go back to the gate!"" And immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

But right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

She came back to my seat and barked: 
""Police will be waiting for you when we land in Boston.""

My seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. I had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no I don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

Her statement caused me to panic inside. I'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

So I took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight.

____________________

I (28F) am marrying my fiancé (32M) in March.

I was in my parents home recently and I was telling them about our wedding party, which is going to include a male friend of mine as a groomsman. For some background. This male friend, we'll call him Stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. My fiancé said he'd love to have Stephen as a groomsman, and i asked Stephen and he was delighted!

Then, I told my parents, and they were like ""oh we didn't realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. She'll be in all the photographs, we don't think that's appropriate""  So I was obviously instantly mad.They then said that they weren't going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that I would need to remove Stephen from the wedding party if I wanted them to come to the wedding. 

So I basically told them that if they weren't comfortable they didn't have to come. I left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. I then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if I remove Stephen. Basically bribing us. I just told her I needed space and I hung up.

That was 3 days ago and I haven't spoken to them. I'm shocked because they have never spoken ill of Stephen before,! I'm upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. I am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think I would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.

I don't know if I should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if I should leave it to them. A few people I've spoken to have said I'm being a bit of an asshole because they're my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it's something I don't agree with. That I'll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. I've had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and I'm being selfish. A cousin texted me to say that I'm choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won't be attending if my parents aren't, and the same for other members of the family. So it's basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! 

My view is that I don't think it's selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone I love. I feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! 

Also to be clear I am 100% not removing Stephen from my wedding or taking the money, I'm not considering either option (my fiancé is in full agreement). But I just want to know if I'm the asshole for so easily accepting that my parents (and by default a lot of my family) won't be coming to my wedding?",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, but actually close to a year ago. Last October to be exact. 

So backstory. I had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. Her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. They just didn't want one thing: us having sex before marriage. They had a lot of reasons. And we were actually planning on it. But we both weren't virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. So of course, temptation got the better of us. Okay, end of backstory. 

She was a senior in high school and I had just started college about an hour away. We rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. We would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. Everytime she would leave I would get sad, but knew I'd see her again. 

One time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. No answer. She said she was gonna text her. Made sense to me. Once she said we had, we got right to business. She put her phone on the bed, and I didn't even 

Things went on for awhile. Lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. Lots of fun. And by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. Followed by some vibrating. It was her phone ringing, but we couldn't find it. Then we found it under my ass. We laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. It was her mom. And within seconds, my girlfriend's expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

Turns out that she hadn't clicked send on the text she sent out. So her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. And in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone ""daddy"" who was definitely not her dad (the mother's words, not mine).  

She told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
My girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. I attempted to calm her down but she wouldn't. So I drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. Her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying ""how could she do this"" and other things along those lines. My girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. Her mother absolutely said I was not allowed over. 

So we got back to our hometown, I parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn't get caught. She drove home. I called my mom for a surprise ""I'm home for the weekend"". She came and picked me up, and I bawled in her arms. I told her everything. She comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

We got back to my house, and I laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. I cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. For the longest time, I thought I never would hear from her again. Then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. She said she was coming over and we needed to talk. Once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. She said her parents were calm now, and then I was gonna be able to come talk. I was nervous, but I loved her so I did it. 

When I got to their house, I walked in and instantly just started apologizing. I went on and on about how ""we won't do it again"" and how ""we're just stupid teenagers"" and most importantly how I was gonna ""rebuild their trust"". Eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. We opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

At the end of it all, I learned they just loved their daughter and didn't want her getting hurt. But they trusted me. And we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. And everything is cool. Sometimes I worry it's still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support.

"AITA? My husband and I are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. His mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but I don't want to do that.","My stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and I decided that we will be getting him a car. I make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. That's fine with me.

His mother is a woman who I make the effort to be civil with but don't like. I am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. She called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. We are not friends and I won't even describe her as nice to me.

When my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

I don't want to do that. I don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. I don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but I don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

I don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. And I don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

I know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. I'm civil to his mom and I never talk negatively about her to him. Is that not enough? Am I incapable of being a good step mother to him if I'm not best friends with his mom? Do I have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",AmItheAsshole
Obese children are abused children,"Parents that feed their child a poor diet and cause them to be obese should be treated the same as anti-vaxxer parents. IMO they are both abusing someone who has no say in their health regards and are exposing them to possible health issues in the future. Among some of the things these children are exposed to are risk of diabetes type 2, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. This is not even taking into consideration the lack of self esteem and bullying the child might endure growing up. Everyone says, look at the cute fat baby, but no one ever says, look at that fat cute teenager. 

Edit: Some of you are pointing out that this is the 10th time this type of opinion is posted. I honestly did not know. My inspiration came from a patient I saw this morning. He was mid 20's and 340 lbs. He was complaining of knee and leg pain. We had a conversation and he told me he was big since childhood because his parents fed him McDonalds every day. I was not taking into consideration medical reasons or low income families. I was actually thinking about kids like him that the parents, out of laziness or convenience, just fed him junk food.",unpopularopinion

I'm excited to say my neighbor's husband personally came over to apologize to me, which I caught on camera. He claimed his wife is ""stressed"" over their new baby, which…okay…and promised not to bother us anymore. I suspect one of the neighbors I talked to read him the riot act. I accepted the apology but am keeping the number of a lawyer close by and the cameras are always rolling. Dislike being so paranoid but what are you going to do?

"TIFU by accidentally getting sexual with my dentist, again.","I'm a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because I'm an idiot. 

My dentist is a very nice and professional man. Our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us ""being strangers."" My immediate reply was ""oh, you're not a stranger! You've been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!"" I did NOT intend to make a sexual joke. His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. 

I had my second dentist appointment today. I actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn't say anything weird, thank you very much. He had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. His face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. I was a bit concerned and also confused. Like how could I have embarrassed him this time? I had hardly spoken! So he keeps working in there and then I realize what the hell is happening. My dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. I had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. 

Never going back.

Update - Dog Ate Neighbor's Drone,"*Edit: [Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

A small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

I was served a summons by a Sheriff's Deputy, neighbor decided to take me to Small Claims over his drone. My MIL is a paralegal secretary, so I was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. He seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. He also suggested I counter sue and how I could possibly add in more damages. 

He also told me that my neighbor and I technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under FAA regulations. I called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). I don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. They took my information and have called me back once, so I know they're investigating but don't know anything else. Not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

I brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos I had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. His main argument to the judge was that I ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which I (somehow) trained him to do"". Which, yes I had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so I have somewhere to sit and eat outside. I argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. In the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). He is also banned from flying over my property, and I installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. He seems pretty upset with me, so I wanted to be careful. 

The only thing that could make this better is if the FAA finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",legaladvice

[Update] I take prescription medication for ADHD. Started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. Company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. Left old job for new one and now I'm unemployed.,"Link to original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

I am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

I met with an attorney for a consultation Thursday. After talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has ADHD. I could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. She told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as I could get punitive damages. I told her I don't want to sue anyone if I don't have to, I just want this job offer back as I have been waiting a long time for a job like this. She also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, I could file an EEOC charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

Ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. Due to an unrelated incident a while back, I have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my Google Drive. I played the calls with my manager to the attorney. When my manager informed me of the preliminary result I explained to her my prescription medication and my ADHD. The attorney told me it was good that I disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and ADHD would not cause any issues in performing my duties). I was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. The call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but I would be paid for my one day of work. As far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. Any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if I knew I would fail. I had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

I asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because I signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. She would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. She said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. She said ultimately the point of having a lab test and MRO is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the MRO is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. If it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

Anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of HR and their legal department. When she initially talked to the head of HR, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. He called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. My attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if I could come into her office that afternoon. I agreed.

When I was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of HR, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. Essentially this call was an apology to me. The head of HR profusely apologized for this. He went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in HR and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. If he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. He went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of HR felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. They want me to come back in Monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. He stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" He even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch Monday.

He told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my ADHD. I told them that wasn't necessary as I am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

So now I have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of HR. I owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. I wish I could personally shake hands with all of you. I was so scared before reading your comments. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

"TIFU by teaching my children not to fight, but to work together","Almost two years ago now.

Two kids, boys, 5 and 4. Fight like cats and dogs. Anything to annoy the other and start a fight. Grab a random object and throw it at the other when Dad isn't looking kind of thing.

One day I'm cleaning up the kitchen and the ruckus is extreme. I interject and sit them both down for a long talk about how much better things can be if they cooperate instead. At the end of it, I went back into the kitchen and resumed cleaning. A remarkable length of *quiet* while later, the 4yo comes to me.

4yo: Dad, Dad, come see what I made! \*grabbing my hand\*

Me: Sure, lets see.

He leads me to their room to the corner table where they have art supplies. And points to the papers on the table. He likes to draw and I encourage it when I can. What I see on the table however, are just random scribbles...

Me: Is this what you wanted to show me? \*I pick up the paper and check both sides, just a few random scribbles\*

Me: That's... great buddy, but why don't you come get me when it's finished? \*I put the paper down and turn to walk\*

4yo: No, NO! Dad, *LOOK!* \*pointing at the papers\*

Okay, maybe I missed one? I look through them again, no, just scribbles? I'm still looking at them when suddenly..

4yo grabs the papers from my hand and tosses them back on the table.

4yo: OK Dad, I'll show you later, you can go. \*pushing me towards the door\*

I'm a little confused, he's not like this usually. I pause outside their room, and when I do, I hear the crinkle of cellophane. 

My boys room is off the hallway leading to the stairs down the the basement. The stairs to the basement, are crinkling. 

I poke my head around the corner of the staircase and there is 5yo. With a package of Oreos clutched to his chest. He looks at me with big eyes and I just hold out one hand and point with the other. I took the package and he walked by right as I couldn't hold my Dad face any longer. 

See, the Oreos were on top of the refrigerator. So what has happened is 4yo baited me, while 5yo got a chair from the dining room, carried it to the kitchen to retrieve the loot then put the chair back and hid. This has to have been meticulously plotted. I'm a mix of horrified and proud.

I had to quickly put Dad face back on to tell them to not sneak treats and to now clean their room. Then I left the room and had a brief ""What have I done?"" moment back in the living room.

TL;DR My kids went from the Animaniacs to Pinky and the Brain.",tifu

Getting a babies ears pierced should be illegal.,"Edit: I'm against circumcision as well, I'm against anything to a baby that isn't medically needed. I'm just having this argument about piercings because I've never seen it discussed. It's the same as tattooing a baby. You're modifying their body without their consent at all. They have no idea what day it is, so how can they tell you yes that they want piercings? 


I've wondered this all my life. 

When I was a kid, I got my ears pierced. I had waited so long and finally after my mom was sure it was what i wanted, she let me get them done. I went to the place and saw a baby screaming as she was getting her ears pierced. Her mom was holding her and telling her to quiet down because she was screaming. I remember looking at my mom and asking why she was doing that. My mom sometimes just didn't have an answer and that was a time that she didn't. Even then I knew something was wrong with that picture. 

So now I'm older and realize that getting babies ears pierced is really fucked up. The baby can't even say yes or no to wanting their ears pierced. We all throw a fit when someone can't consent to something these days, so really why is this allowed? 

I've met people who had this happen and they didn't like the idea of piercings, but still had the holes in their ears from it. I got mine done years ago and I never wear earrings, but the holes are still there. I don't regret it, but I can't imagine how people feel that they got their ears pierced against their will when they couldn't even understand the meaning behind it. 

Anytime I bring this up it's an ""you're overreacting"" or ""it's not your child, why do you care?"" I feel like I'm going insane here, but how is this okay. How is piercing a baby who can't even understand what pierced ears are okay? ",unpopularopinion
TIFU by pooping on my police academy hat.,"Been in the academy 3 months, we have to wear baseball caps that say ""POLICE ACADEMY"" on them whenever we are outside. When we go inside we tuck the caps into the back of our pants to hold them. I ate mango habanero wings at BDubs last night and had explosive diarrhea this morning so I decided to poop before going into class. Went to the stall, pulled my pants down and spewed lava for 20 minutes. When I was done I stood up, turned around to flush and noticed something under all the shit. Then noticed the words ""POL"", was confused for a good 30 seconds before it hit me. Drill instructor yelled at me for being outside without a cover, asked me why, and instead of the usual ""no excuse sir"", I told him. He laughed for 5 minutes, first time I've ever seen him smile. He gave me a new cover and told all the other instructors who now call me ""shit head"".

TIFU by nearly twisting my dick off with a Fleshlight duct taped to an industrial fan.,"Alright so this was a few weeks ago. I was going to post about it then but decided to see how things healed since I knew there would probably be questions. This is long but there was a lot too it sorry.

This began as many other bad ideas do, I had smoked some herb and was horny. My roommate was out of town for the day and I had the place to myself, figured I would take advantage of the rare opportunity and try to enjoy something more than just a speed fap. I pulled out the fleshlight that  I rarely use and started to get to work. I was at my computer but could not really get into it. Trying to operate the mouse and the fleshlight while lubed up was too cumbersome and it just felt like jacking off with more steps involved(the main reason I don't really use it). I pulled up some porn on my phone and tried to find a way to stuff the fleshlight between my mattress, and then in a shoe for a hands free experience but still was having trouble so gave up.  

Leaning over the bed my box fan was blowing on my bare ass so I went over too shut it off and that's when I got the idea. I took the front grill off and duct tape the back of the fleshlight too the center of the fan. Overwhelmed with anticipation of my new discovery I lubed up my boner, inserted it and turn on the fan. It felt extremely good but was not quite working, the fan was too weak and the friction was slowing it down nearly to a stop, I knew I was onto something and needed a bigger fan. Being walking distance from a Walmart I headed over.  

They had a couple to choose from I almost went with the biggest $140 drum fan since bigger seemed better(REALLY glad I didn't) but instead opted for the $60 Industrial floor fan that seemed like It would be more than good enough for the job at hand. I also happened to pick up one of those stupid hands free phone supports that go around your neck so I could have the ultimate experience. At this point I couldn't wait and basically power walked home with this giant box. I opened it up, took off the front grill and rigged it up the same way. Phone around my neck, looking like an idiot, I lubed up and inserted my dong.

What came next was pure heaven, this was legit one of the best things I have ever felt. The fleshlight was slightly off center so it almost made it vibrate while spinning. The vibration mixed with the spinning, the nubs in the fleshlight and manual thrusting in and out was insane. I tried the second speed but that was too much to handle. Just as I was really getting into it my phone began to ring, my sister was calling which she doesn't normally do unless it's important. I stopped the fan while still inserted and talked with her on the phone for around 5 minutes. After we finished the call I turned my video and then the fan back on.

This was my big mistake, at this point my meat was nearly flaccid but still stretched out a bit in the fleshlight. In order to secure it to the fan the bottom of the flesh light had to be completely tightened. The bottom usually has a release valve so you can control how much suction there is on the inside, completely tightened is maximum suction. Before I could even comprehend what was happening I felt some tightening and then a searing pain in my penis. My brain took me a second to process before I pulled my dick out and I literally saw it unwind in front of me. I'm uncertain how many times, was at least a couple and the sight of this along with the pain in my wiener caused me to black out. When I came too I shut off the fan which was still spinning and my shlong was feeling red hot. Panicking I just pranced around the gripping it. Other than being really red and shriveled in it looked fairly normal no rips that I could see. Being high and extremely embarrassed I grabbed some frozen vegetables, placed them on my rod and decided to wait it out a bit.  

The waiting was horrible but couple hours in everything seemed to be getting a bit better until I had too pee which just felt like lava dribbling from my shaft. At this point I was feeling more sober and drove myself too the urgent care where I was seen by a doctor and then directed to a urologist. I came clean since I wanted a proper diagnosis and you can imagine the reaction. Almost seemed like he was more disappointed in me with every question I answered. I was given a Cavernosography where they inject die into your cock before an X-ray to see if the vessels are damaged and an MRI. He said that  I may suffer some permanent damage from the penile torsion I was very scared waiting for the results.

That is the point I was originally going to write this but this is the update after 3 weeks. Everything came back good, the inflammation was likely causing the pain inside while urinating, the pain on the outside was from a friction burn, basically after me dick twisted as much as it could the fleshlight was still moving around it for a few rotations and gave me a burn across my whole dick. That has since cleared up and everything is back around 80%. Now that I'm getting boners again I'm honestly half temped to try again since it felt so good. Just remember if you try this to stay extremely hard and well lubricated the whole time.

TL;DR Was high and horny got the idea to duct tape a fleshlight to an industrial fan. Things went wrong when I turned it on with a flaccid penis. My dick twisted multiple times before I passed out. After seeing a urologist no permanent damage was incurred besides some inflammation and a friction burn on my entire shaft. Everything is feeling good again and may give it another go in the future.",tifu

I confronted him. I asked if he had ever been unfaithful. He looked like he was about to say no then he admitted four women and the nanny. Two were in a city he travels to frequently. One was a one night stand on a trip. And one was local. All told, he had a mistress for about seven of the thirteen years we were married. I can't imagine what the women went through. If they didn't know he was married, then they were victims. If they did know, then I hope they find peace from whatever demon caused them to sleep with a married man.  


I think I could've stayed with him if it had just been the women. Maybe, I can't say for sure. But the nanny was a violation of trust and an act of a troubled man. She had to fear for her job. I can't blame her in any way, and I'll reach out to her when the time is right to make sure again she knows she's loved.  


The kids cried when we told them. He's at an Airbnb until he can find more permanent housing. I'll stay here with the kids. The current nanny is moving in for the foreseeable future and my mother is coming to help. We'll all be ok.

TIFU by going jogging - I'm bloody and afraid to go this route again.,"Unlike most TIFU posts, this happened just half an hour ago. 

I'm a 21 year-old male. I was out running my 2 miles. Headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. I round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and I see this big black duck looking at me. As I get closer, I think to myself, ""Man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?"" I keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. So I stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. This bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. Like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.

I'm thinking to myself, ""What the fuck?"" So I'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and I keep running think he will leave me alone. I start running again and the faster I run, the faster he chases me. I start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. I'm thinking, ""I've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, I don't need this shit"" so I stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. In all my years of being a person, I've never trained for this.

This little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. He starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as I'm trying to run backwards away from him. We've covered a quarter mile at this point. I try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. I'm thinking, ""How the fuck am I gonna explain this if I have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? I'm a grown ass man. This is bullshit.""

I try running again and he keeps flying after me. I'm at a loss. I don't know what to do at this point. I'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. Am I really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? Like, I don't want to, but I might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? Seriously?"" We have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. He bites me again and I drop my phone. I pick it up quickly. Who do I call? I've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. While I'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, I hear a noise; Someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.

This was a big mistake. The duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. I saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. I feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. The last I saw of him was the look I took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake I did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.

I cannot make this shit up. I would have recorded it, and I tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.

This is bullshit. I'm covered in cuts and bites. Most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something I was not ready for.

TL;DR I'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. I'm covered in blood.

If I were given legal permission to eat human flesh I would happily try it,"The idea of eating of human flesh has always made me curious, now I'm not saying that I wanna eat humans, I'd just only eat if I were I given permission or if the corpse died recently like in a car crash.

 I told this to every one in my religion/philosophy class where we were discussing moral desicion making. If you know that senario where you're in WW2 and your hiding from the nazis with a group of people but then suddenly the baby starts crying. Would you kill the baby and save everyone in the room or dont do anything and get everyone killed including yourself

Most people said kill the baby and I followed up with it saying ""Yeah, and if were hungry we can eat the baby, since at that time of war, you wouldn't wanna starve""

Everyone in that class were freaking out by what I said and the teacher was speechless. And now they bring it up everytime in class. I don't mind it really but surely people must agree with me on this.

Edit: This is my most upvoted post on reddit. And its about cannibalism. I just wanna make something clear because some guy just tried to report me to the  DOJ.

 I dont want to murder people. I just wanna try out a sample of human flesh, only for the legal reasons. I am crazy, but I'm not insane to go on some quest for the flesh. I have more important things to do in life. And if this bites me back in the ass. Its just gonna be wasting everyones time because I have no interest in pursuing this. Its more of the curiousity of it, not the actions. Thank you and goodbye

Edit 2: Also to mention people are saying ""prion diseases"" and you're right. I don't want to get prion disease, so theres no way I'll be eating human anytime soon. 😂

Edit 3: People are also saying ""why not just eat my own self""? Well because thats auto-cannibalism. I rather have my limbs and flesh to my self. If someone was mad enough to amputate him/herself and offer me flesh. Thens theres nothing stopping me from eating it, is there?

Like I don't mind really, as long as they  don't come knocking on my door. This is was only an opinion I expressed on /r/UnpopularOpinions and it was all fun and goofs.

This situation is getting too serious, I never did or said anything that was illegal. I know what I wrote was gross and inhumane but doesn't mean you have to get me behind bars for it.

"I am 25 and getting married. Dealing with issue around picking my ""Maid of Honor"" for my wedding. Friends [women in their 20s] think my brother [35/M] is a bad choice.","  

I am planning my wedding to my awesome fiancé and am so excited. We've been planning the event and will be married later in the year. He has his Best Man (his brother) and groomsmen mostly picked out. I thought I did, too. We each have 6 people and I have 5 female bridesmaids and a ""man of honor"" which I want to be my brother. My bridesmaids think this isn't a great idea and a few are hurt I'm not choosing them instead. Here's why I want to choose my brother. 

My biological mother lost custody of me when I was 4 and I was put in an emergency foster situation with a family. I lived with them for 6 months but was then put back into my mother's case. From 4 1/2ish to 6 I lived with my mother and it was bad. She was too sick, too addicted and too weak to handle a child and by 6 I was being adopted out. By some miracle, the family who took me in at 4 got ahold in the system and I went to live with them and was later adopted. The family had boys – the youngest was 16 when I got there. I was terrified of him when I got there, which they told me about recently (I have no recollection of that). I do remember him spending the summer with me, teaching me to swim, teaching me how to play games, teaching me how different appliances worked. He skipped a summer job to help our mom with my adjustment. I had eating problems, I had dental problems, I had a snoot full of health problems – including parasites. He came to doctor appointments, he also helped get me ready for school (I hadn't started kindergarten yet and would actually never go). He and my mom would do learning activities with me and by September I was okay to enter first grade. I used to lay on my stomach and play geography games with him and he'd reward me with Riesens. We were very close, he didn't go away to college as is tradition and instead stayed home to go to a good university locally. He'd pick me up from schools some days and from 6 to 12 I had an older brother to rely on. He eventually moved out and went to medical school (he's such a great person for that field). 

Very literally my brother helped save my life. I was suicidal as a young kid, and through a lot of changes and help, was able to climb out. He was a calm stable influence in my life. I credit him, my mother and father with saving my life – I would never have gone to college, I probably wouldn't have graduated high school or even lived as I was so sick. I had 4 endoscopies, 4 colonoscopies and 3 surgeries before I was 8. My family doesn't look like me (I'm most likely Mexican and something else, most probably African-American) and doesn't come from where I do, but they never treated me any differently than their other kids. Since the others were older and out of the home I was never as close to them as I was my parents and brother. 

My thinking is, a Maid of Honor is someone really important and I cannot think of anyone else who comes close. I haven't even asked him yet but I think he'd do it. I told my parents and they said they wouldn't say anything to him but thought it was a great idea. My husband is also good with it and think it's a sweet thing to do, but my female friends were horrified I suggested it and think it's ""creepy"". If I look back on that time, it's the happiest a person could be. Is it weird and creepy? Does it contravene some weird relationship boundary between brothers and sisters? Is it highly inappropriate?",relationship_advice

Ex-wife's new wife is attempting blackmail,"Background: I transitioned to SAHD for several years when my wife began work as an attorney. We mutually agreed to a divorce a couple years ago and remained close. Because I'd put my own education and career on hold for her, plus a fair amount of debt accrued based on trying to make my ex's plans-on-a-whim work so that I could stay near our kids, I'm starting from rock bottom. I've lived with my in-laws for quite a while as I'm finishing my long-delayed BA while trying to transition out of retail and into better-paying work so I can afford a place of my own. She started a relationship with a woman, ""Judith,"" in the finance industry who offered to mentor me into entering the industry as well. Neither my ex nor I realized that Judith was giving me misleading advice while badmouthing me to my ex and her business contacts. A few months later it came out that Judith was manipulating and physically abusing my ex. My ex ran, but she decided to return after a week. Since then, Judith has made infrequent contact with me via text and email, swinging between attempts at intimidation and playing nice. I currently live in upstate NY with the in-laws. My ex, her wife, and the kids live in MA.

The incident in question happened a couple weeks ago. Judith sent me an email saying that she was giving me 30 days' notice to move out of the in-laws' and into a new place. (I had been open with them, before Judith's behavior came to light and after, about my financial situation and how I was finally saving enough to move out early this year.) If I'm not out by that time, Judith said, she'll tell my in-laws that I was emotionally and sexually abusive to their daughter (my ex) during our marriage.

(EDIT: Her threat was slightly more subtle than that - it was basically, ""Would her parents continue to let you live there if someone told them this? Probably not!"" And in the immediate follow-up email, ""You have 30 days to get out."" So it may not be quite so cut and dry. Otherwise I would have probably just gone straight to a lawyer or the police.)

Because the context is internal to a family situation, I'm not sure how or whether the law on coercion applies. I've briefly looked at the coercion statutes for both NY and MA, as well as the federal statute. I may have been married to an attorney, but I don't know enough myself to even figure out where jurisdiction would lie in this situation. I don't know what steps I should take or when.

TIFU by pitching a really fucking stupid slogan to my only cool client,"I'm in marketing, particularly in the business of slogans. So, a few days ago I was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and they told me they had a problem: They had an uncharacteristically shitty location.

There's no way people were just finding this place on their own. It was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. So, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.

Last night, I went there to get some food... for research, ya know... Anyway, I was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. The pizza was really good. The beer selection was varied. They had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. Pretty good stuff. Even if I wasn't writing for them, I would've given them 5 stars on Yelp, is what I mean.

When I was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.

I wrote a lot of garbage for a while (""Where Wine Country Is Next Door!""), but I was determined to get something usable. 

Finally, it hit me: ""Go Somewhere."" It had nearly everything I wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.

But, still, it wasn't quite there. It lacked the feel I wanted, felt a little too abstract. Customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. They needed to be pointed.

After another hour or so, I had it.

Eventually, the slogan I pitched these poor people was this:

""Go Somewhere Else""

Which, I believe the corporate equivalent of is like ""Get the fuck out of my face.""

They haven't emailed me back.

TL;DR: Today I fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan I wrote and I'm pretty sure I definitely lost a client because of it.",tifu
I think my dads company is responsible for his death [California],"My dad passed away last week while at work. He had a massive heart attack. He was in the bathroom while the attack happened and he tried calling 911 repeatedly. Here's the thing though, 6 months ago, his company installed some kind of signal blocking device in the bathrooms because employees were going to the toilet and browsing the internet. 

The doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. Last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so I'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived. 

I spoke to the company and they've told me to get lost, saying it's private property and they're well within their rights to use jammers how they please. Is that true? I'm struggling with the funeral costs as it is, I can't afford a lawyer, especially if it's going to go nowhere. ",legaladvice
WIBTA if I report my son's school?,"Okay, so at my son's school they have a system where kids get points for good behavior and negative marks for behavior that needs work. There is an app where parents can view this as well as communicate with teachers. 

My son's grade (1st) was having an end of the year good behavior field trip to a skating rink. The kids that could go had to have so many good behavior points. My son was diagnosed with ADHD and we are working on ways to help him control his energy and to behave better. That said, he was about 5 points shy of being able to go on the field trip. Because of that I did not send in a signed permission slip or money. 

The day of the field trip comes around and k send my son to school expecting him to have to go to another class room for the day. After school I pick him up and ask how his day was and he proceeds to tell me that they took him with them on the field trip. He said he was told to sit at a table on the side of the skating rink and to do a work packet while watching the other kids. 

He was upset because he was made to sit and watch everyone else having fun. That is understandable because these kids are 7 years old. Yes he understands consequences for bad behavior but what adult thinks this is a good consequence? So since it was after school, I messaged his teacher asking about it. I have not gotten a reply. I tried calling the principal and was unable to reach her. 

So I would like to know WIBTA for calling the school board or whoever I need to call and reporting the school? I'm not talking about just reporting because they did a messed up, hurtful punishment but also because I was not made aware my son would be driven from the school for that day.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?,"Necessary information: When my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. After a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. Except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

That was when my husband and I stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. When she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and I still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. Once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200B;

Now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. He's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. My daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. Since I'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. I asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. I asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. I also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200B;

He thought of asking me because I had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". I told him that no, it was not. I was 42 then and I'm 59 now, I didn't had the health issues that I do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. Also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  I would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. Now he thinks I'm playing favorites and that I'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but I think I'm just being reasonable.

&#x200B;

Edit: While it is nice to know that I'm not the asshole, my son has found the post and is now very mad at me for ""shaming him and his wife on the internet"". I disagree as it was not my intent and I never disclosed any information that could be used to identify them both. He's also very mad about being called an asshole. While he is my son, I find that he needs a wake up call since my conversation with him in private about the issue only made him behave like a spoiled child and his reaction to me looking for input as an anonymous person was to call and yell at me on the phone. I'll let this post stay up and let this be a lesson to him.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling my husband I won't take my stepdaughter on holiday again?,"I have two children from a previous relationship. Danielle (11) and Elliot (7). My husband John loves them as his own, but also has a fifteen year old daughter, Alicia, from a previous relationship. We've been married four years, but I've only seen her a handful of times, firstly because she spends of her time with her mother, and also because she attends an elite boarding school for girls, so the opportunity to see her is very rare. 

Over the summer me and the kids went on holiday to Spain for three weeks. John was supposed to come but he was snowed under with work commitments. However, when he told Alicia, she said she's always wanted to go there and she begged him to convince me to let her come, which I did, but her mum had to pay for her flight/place in the hotel. 

It all went well at first, but a problem started when it turned out Alicia didn't pack anywhere near three weeks worth of clothing, meaning that initially she had to borrow some of mine - which were oversized - and then when we went shopping, I couldn't afford anywhere near the sort of clothing she likes, and she cried at having to make do with ''cheap'' stuff. She then phoned up her mum crying saying I was being unfair to her for making her wear clothes that she wasn't ''used to'' She also continuously tried to persuade me to buy her alcohol. 


We had another row when she met some boys from the same country as us in a restaurant/bar. She was cuddling with one of them, and when Elliot was tired and we needed to go home, she tried to stay with them and go back to where they were staying. As her guardian on the trip I was not prepared to allow her to go home with a group of boys we'd never met in a foreign country. She threw a huge tantrum at me about this when we got home, saying what's the point in coming on holiday if I won't let her have fun. 

Finally, Alicia was sulking throughout the journey home, and took to trying to antagonise Danielle, asking her if she's ready to have ''no friends'' once she starts secondary school, calling her ugly and things like that. I stopped this immediately and she sulked even more. 

When we got back I told John how difficult Alicia had been throughout the trip and said that I wouldn't take her on a trip with me again. He insisted that none of what she did was that bad, but I insisted on speaking to Alicia's mum on the phone and telling her everything her daughter had done. She defended her daughter completely and insisted that everything she did was ''what teenage girls do''. I was shocked, but after John and Leanne (his ex) spoke over the phone he has been defending her too, insisting that she's really nice if I get to know her and things like that. 

I've not said that I'll never be in the same room as her again, I've just said that I won't take someone that badly behaved on holiday with me again, but John says that I'm overreacting, and that I should give her another chance, which I have no intention of doing.

UPDATE: Thanks for all these responses they gave me a lot of food for thought. While I still stand by my decision and won't take Alicia on holiday unless John is there with me, a lot of people said that I haven't taken enough time to actually get to know my stepdaughter which to be honest is true, but as said above there are reasons for this. Even though she's a very smart kid (girls have to pass very difficult entry exams to go to that school even if their parents can afford it), I think there are better ways to bring out her potential than boarding school. It is of course Leanne's decision but it isn't something I'd have chosen for her or any of my kids. As some of the comments here have suggested it is entirely possible feels unloved and also unwelcome in our household, which isn't true at all, which is why I told John that I will make the effort to get to know Alicia properly, and actually suggested that we invite her here next time she's home from boarding, and hope to spend as much time with her as I can.",AmItheAsshole

Way Late Update: My mom stole a trust fund I didn't know I had and now the IRS is coming after me for unpaid taxes.,"[Original post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/39tlzj/mom_stole_a_trust_fund_i_didnt_know_i_had_now_the)

I'm only three years late but wanted to update this post. 


I reached out to the IRS who, after several phone calls and hours on hold, told me nothing could be done and to just pay up. I called one more time and a much nicer agent told me more kindly that nothing could be done unless I could get my mother to admit to withdrawing the money in writing.


I told her that if she just told the truth, admitted it to me and the IRS and wrote the letter, I would forgive her and we could put it behind us. She refused. I told her to not contact me again until she was ready to stop blaming others and admit what she had done.


A few (blissfully calm) weeks later she called me and apologized. She wrote a handwritten letter stating she withdrew the money without my knowledge and none of the proceeds went towards my care. I wrote my own letter explaining that I was already an adult immigrating to another country at the time of the withdrawal, and attached a photocopy of my passport stamps, an affidavit that I had never lived at the address the cheque was sent to, and the receipt of my immigration application which was dated prior to the withdrawal. I asked that the tax liability be transferred to my mother and included her SS number which she signed off on.


The IRS sent me a letter back stating that the taxes owing would be issued under my mother's name. Because she was a jobless crack addict, her income was under the federal threshold and she did not need to pay anything due to how low her income was that year. Disaster averted.


For those curious, no, I never got the money back and decided not to pursue it. I didn't know it existed before the IRS contacted me, and didn't feel it was in anyone's best interest to force the issue knowing that I'd never get repaid anyways. Mom quit crack a year or two back, but still battles her demons in the form of alcoholism. Our relationship has slightly improved. Also, I'm a woman (most comments assumed I was male).

"Husband died Saturday, wondering if I have a potential lawsuit case. (IL, USA)","Not sure why my initial attempt to post showed up with a finance marker by the flair so I'm trying again... 

My husband and I boarded an Amtrak train in Chicago on Saturday. Before the train departed the station, my husband suffered a heart attack and collapsed. The train doors were already closed for departure and we were unable to alert Amtrak staff. There were no emergency phones or emergency stop buttons available in the car. A fellow passenger and I were so desperate to notify Amtrak employees and prevent the train from departing that we attempted to remove an emergency window.  Between the two of us passengers, we were not able to remove the window. My husband and I were visiting from Japan so we do not have phones on a US network to dial 911 so we had to wait for a passenger to do so. The emergency responders did not arrive until 20-30 min after the event began - even though Amtrak Police officers were only 30 seconds away in the station the train was still sitting at.  So basically once the train closed the doors, there was no way to notify Amtrak of the emergency.  I believe that had there been an emergency phone, speaker, or button available in the car, the medical response would have been much faster and my husband would have stood a chance for survival.

[Update 3] My wife named our son after her first love and I had no idea.,"So I want to start out by saying think you for all the support. Most of you guys have been great with the exception of a few trolls calling me a cuck. 

So I came home the next day after staying the night else where. She didn't really say much to me other then hey and went back to messing around on her laptop. I went up stairs and put my things in the guest room and layed down to take a nap because I didn't get much sleep the night before. She came in and asked what I was doing and I told her that until she's ready to sit down and have a adult conversation about the name that I would be sleeping in here. She rolled her eyes and said that she thought I had got over and asked why I even bothered to come home if I was going to act like this. I told her because it is my home and I'm not going to miss out on time with my son just because you don't have the ability to tell right from wrong or atleast admit it. She stormed off and that was that for that day. 

The next day she I came home from work and she was on the couch waiting for me.  She asked what it was going to take for us to get back to normal. I told her that we would need to see a marriage counciler first off and consider changing our son's name to his middle name. The look of rage on her face when I said that last part was something I don't think I've ever seen before. I hate to say it but it mad me a little happy to see it. She told me to go fuck myself and that was never going to happen and stormed off. We didn't talk the rest of that day.

The next day rolled around and my wife hadn't gotten home from work. Someone started knocking on the door and it was her parents. They said we need to talk so I invited them in we sat down. They said they know what she did was wrong and they always knew and so did her whole family and all her friends. They apologized to me for keeping it a secret and said that they agree with counseling and they would be happy to pay for it but changing his name is going to far. I told them thank you and that I haven't made that decision with out a lot of consideration. I told them that you really don't know what you would do till you're in this situation. After a little more talking they left and asked me not to tell my wife they stopped by. I agreed. Shortly after they left I called around and found a counciler and made appointment that worked with both our work schedules. 

When my wife came her I told her about the appointment and she just walked off not saying a word. Our appointment is Thursday and I'm still sleeping in the guest room. That's what's been going on so far. Thank you guys and I'll try to update you again when I can.

Edit. I just want say I'm not just going to up and change the name. It's something I'm considering. I want to talk to the counciler first to see what impact it might have if any and how to go about it if there are none",relationship_advice
My (19F) boyfriend (22M) was taking secret nudes and sending them to his friends group chat,"I've been dating this guy for about a year now. It's not a long time, I know, but I felt like we really connected and stuff like it feels like we've been known each other our whole lives or something. I sound so stupid, I know. I just really trusted and loved him. A lot. I trusted him with my life. A year cmon 

I went on his phone when he was in the shower to search something up because mine was in the other room and he got some notifications of his friends group chat and they were saying stuff like she's so hot, you're so lucky etc so I was naturally curious and disgusted to find out that they were looking at a video of ME that my boyfriend secretly took while I was giving him a blowjob. I am pretty conservative, my parents don't even know that I'm not a virgin, and I have sex with my boyfriend and all that but he knows I do not do pictures because I don't want them to get out and have my reputation ruined, my parents would literally kill me. I remember him on his phone, I asked him what he was doing and he said he was just checking something and then he put it away. I never fucking thought that he was taking a video 

I feel so disgusted I can't even describe the feeling in my stomach like I want to throw up and take a shower and rip my skin off. All these pictures and videos he'd taken of me during sex like quick blurry pictures when my back is turned or short videos like during doggy when I'm not looking at him. I just feel so fucking gross. And who sends that to their friends??? That's so weird!!! You're sending videos of you having sex to your ""bros"", that is so fucking weird. And the other guys would throw in pictures and shit too but those girls were happily posing for the camera and seemed like they knew what was happening 

I cannot even believe he would do this to me. I was still on his phone when he came back from the shower and he quickly grabbed it from my hand and said I was invading his fucking privacy. Seriously??? Your privacy feels invaded right now??? You clueless asshole. I just started yelling at him and honestly I'm not proud of it but I started hitting him and grabbed his towel. He was acting like I was overreacting and he started hitting me back. Are you fucking serious, these guys all have videos and pictures of me and who knows who they showed them to or if they put them online or sold them for money. He started saying some bullshit how his friends think I'm so hot and they just compliment me and it's nothing bad. And you're not gonna believe this... he said they kept pressuring him to contribute to the group chat and he knew I was way too respectable to agree to it so he had to take the pictures and shit behind my back literally. He wasn't even saying sorry and said it was really flattering and they all think I'm so hot  

What kind of a betrayal. I wish this bitch cheated on me or fucked my best friend or dumped me over text or something not as bad as this. I have no idea how many people have seen me naked and having sex at this point and I just wanna step out of my body and throw this one out. I feel so fucking exposed like I saw those videos, I had NO IDEA what was going on, in my head I was thinking about how much I love him and how happy I was and look at what this bitch was doing 

And he texted me afterwards saying we both lost control and we should just say sorry and move on and he'll stop doing it. And he said he was really hurt that I'd take his towel and leave him in a vulnerable state like that and he'd be waiting for my apology. He is so fucking clueless I don't even know what to say",relationship_advice
Visiting my little brother who is homeless and an addict.,"My little brother is homeless and an addict.  He has been in and out of jail/rehab and on the streets for for a while now.  It appears that he has given up now and has no plans to do anything, but continue using and living on the streets.  It looks like his health is drastically declining.  He has lost 60-100 pounds in the last 6-8 months.  It appears that he is shooting up, I think meth, as he says, though, he was doing heroin, but said he stopped.  

I'm flying out to visit him for his birthday in a couple weeks.  But mostly, I'm flying out because I don't think he'll be around much longer.  I think this will be the last time I see my brother.  

I'm trying to figure out what my time with him should be like.  I know I need to have boundaries as to not be enabling, though I don't think I would be.  I more or less just don't know if I should be putting pressure on him to change or if I should just have it be a time where I'm present with him?  

I want to avoid causing him to feel more shame than he does.  I understand he probably feels very ostracised from family and all of life, really.  I'd like to show him compassion as much as possible, but I also want him to get better.  

I also just kinda feel like I'm waiting for him to die.  

I don't know.  My thoughts are kinda scrambled and I'm not certain what I'm asking really.  I guess just general advice for the situation?  I just don't know what this time is supposed to be like.",relationship_advice

With subtitles, I never worry about this struggle. I always know exactly what they said. I've always been a big fan of well done character development, and dialogue is central to that.

[Update] Mother in law suing for visitation in ny.,"On mobile. Also, this is gonna be a bit long. 

Here is the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aq9o11/mother_in_law_is_suing_for_visitation_ny/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

We went to court for our initial hearing in February. I asked for dismissal citing Troxel V. Granville. The judge agreed that we were within our rights, however she couldn't grant a dismissal because my MIL requested an attorney. The judge advised she didnt qualify for an appointed lawyer so she should seek representation through elder law. My MIL begins raising her hands and waving them around asking if she could be allowed to speak. She states in court that me and my wife bully, abuse, belittle, and swear around the children constantly. The first 3 are outright lies and the 4th, so fucking what? She also stated that she never mentioned once being hacked or being obsessed that she was hacked, and that my oldest daughter was the one obsessed with hacking and spying. The judge made no comments and advised her that we weren't keeping her away from the children and that she should seek relief by visiting them under our supervision. 

Fast forward to a week before the hearing we have to meet with the kaw guardian for the children. We show the law guardian all the insane conspiracy theory texts and the texts where she accuses me of hacking her phone. She spoke with the children and we took our leave. The paperwork we received stated that my MIL showed her a much different conversation. My MIL had deleted the texts that made her look bad and copy pasted several from my wife that made my wife look like a bully and that she was harassing my MIL. The children outright denied any bullying/abuse and stated to the law guardian that my MIL makes them uncomfortable because she is constantly yelling at them, when they want to leave she wont them go and she wont stop talking about who is hacking her. So obviously she supports our position. 

In the hearing my lawyer asked for dismissal, and requested we be paid our legal fees by MIL as the petition was brought in bad faith. My MILs appointed attorney couldnt withdraw and refile an amended petition because MIL wouldnt let her so the judge dismissed and awarded us our legal fees. 

I havent seen the judgement yet but it's my understanding that it was dismissed with prejudice. However my MIL doesnt live in reality and is going to file another petition alleging that I've brainwashed my children. I wish that were true, they never listen to me. So I may have another update for you all shortly, but for now I'll enjoy my victory.",legaladvice

[IL] Neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). Landlord hasn't done anything,"I rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex's parking lot is included in my rent. I have a parking pass that I display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

I have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. I have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. I have also kept a log of every time I notice this neighbor in my spot & when I've contacted my landlord. (For what it's worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he's gone to reserve it, so I don't think this is just confusion - I don't think he owns a spot at all).

This past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. I confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. I once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, I shouldn't have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

Well, apparently neighbor didn't listen, because last night he was in my spot again. I called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn't come or were talked out of it by him, because when I woke up this morning, his car was still there.

Additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an HOA, & my landlord always claims he'll ""notify them"" when I make a complaint about my neighbor. 

I'm growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as I pay for this spot. With that being said, I'd appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. What can I do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. What actions can I take to ensure my neighbor doesn't get me towed from a spot that I am authorized to use?

Update edit: I just spoke with the HOA. They confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn't even have a parking spot at all. HOA also said he should've never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won't happen again. Finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that I can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot. ",legaladvice
"Exwife is going off the deep end. This is in NJ, USA. Can I do anything here?","I get my daughter every other weekend. She's 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

This weekend, we were watching a movie when I got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

Now, I don't attach myself to my phone (unless I'm working) and I got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

When I saw it, I told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and I also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that I told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

The movie ended around 9:10 pm and I had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. I told her I'd be up to tuck her in. 

I went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

He mother was SCREAMING into the phone ""YOU TELL HIM FUCK YOU! YOU CAN SAY THAT! I SAY ITS OK FOR YOU TO TELL YOUR FATHER FUCK YOU!!""

I took the phone from my daughter and I said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

She yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

I asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. My ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

I handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (Bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was Saturday night so I bent the bedtime a bit). 

I had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

I walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""I'm sorry"" into the phone. I fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

I walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

It wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. She had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

I sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. She was really upset and wouldn't speak much. I hugged her. My daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

I'm sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. Divorce is hard enough on children, and I think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be.

I proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. I threw it in the blender and glugged it down. I thought it was weird that it didn't melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. It didn't taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.

AITA for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?,"I am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. They're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

My sister Paula's daughter Amy is the most successful of the bunch. She's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

I don't dislike Amy but she's always been trouble. I have a daughter the same age as her, Charlotte. When they were younger Amy did a great job convincing Charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as Amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

When Amy graduated, Paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and Amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then Paula has gone out of her way to make Amy the centre of attention everywhere. Over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. Amy wanted to go too and Paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from X''. Amy behaved like a brat the entire time and Paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

Amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. I don't mind this but they do, but once again Paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

The final straw came last weekend. My son Mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. Paula, her husband Rob, and Amy were there, and Paula set about trying to convince me to let Amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. Mark's fiancee Vicky barely knows Amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. Paula said Amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

I was frustrated and told Paula that Amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. I told Paula Amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

Unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. Amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying I was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public.

"Vanilla Coke is the best flavor, even better than the regular flavor of Coke.","To begin, what the hell even is the flavor of regular Coke? Sugar? It's indiscernible and, frankly, a little bland. All you really get with the base flavor is fizz. 

With the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. The whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. Like, really well.

In fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange Coke (which just taste like regular Coke with fruits shoved in them).  

The only real downfall to vanilla Coke is that it's not wide-spread; only two stores in my town sell it, which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla Coke is.

AITA for not being attracted to my girlfriend's body?,"I made an ALT account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
I'm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so I'll try to keep it as PG as I can.

So, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. We have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
I will say that she's the first thin person I've ever been with. She's flat, petite and pretty short. Most of the girls I've been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and I've always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
This all started when me and my girlfriend were watching Netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if I was okay with her having a flat chest. (She's always been insecure about not having b**bs.) I asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that I never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. That kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she's not attractive if she doesn't have a certain figure.) She said she was just curious.
I told her I had to be honest, and said that I'm not attracted to her chest size, and that I actually prefer bigger b-bs. It's not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. If I'm being honest, that's why I usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
She was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. She texted me later on that night and told me what I said hurt her a little. She said we've been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like I lied to her. I told her I didn't know what to tell her, and that I was just being honest (I was.).

Am I being the asshole here?

We started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. She would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. I'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. I always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, I wouldn't stop her.

This is where it takes a turn for the weird. I keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. I also go to the gym frequently, so I always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. I never kept count, but I know by just a visual glance I several pairs. This morning when I went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, I noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. Again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. I went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so I checked the washing machine and dryer. Both were empty. I couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. So, I did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. After all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. She went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. When I went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. I told her I wasn't mad, I was just looking for my socks. She kinda mumbled ""I'll don't know."" I still wasn't mad, of course, but I was super confused. Socks just don't disappear. So I asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""I'll buy you new ones!""

The first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. I thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so I joked with her about ruining my socks. Wrong. Thing. To. Say. She started immediately crying. Like, full on sobbing. At this point I don't care about the socks anymore, I want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. I sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. She just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. I tried assuring her again it was okay. Even went so far as to say I would buy new socks and she didn't have to. I sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. I told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

On my way out I grabbed the garbage to take outside. When I got outside I lifted the lid off the garbage can and I noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. I could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. Since I was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, I wanted to see for myself. I opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. There, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. As soon as the smell hit me I knew it WAS POOP.

1. We don't own any pets.
2. We don't have any kids.
3. WHOSE POOP WAS ON MY SOCKS?

Work could wait. I couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. I grabbed the bag and walked back inside. As soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. She said I shouldn't be going through the garbage and that I was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. I asked her to calm down and that I just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. I wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. That's when it clicked. I don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. I asked her ""Is this your poop?"" She started sobbing again and ran out of the house. I didn't go after her this time.

So, now I am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. The only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. Which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. I sent her text asking her to come back. She hasn't responded yet. I don't even know what I'm going to say when (IF) she gets back.

UPDATE:

I had to leave for work and am now at work. Yes, I threw away the bag of poopy socks. She texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. She said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to NOT bring it up in person. I'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as I can. Her responses are super short, but I'm getting the idea.

I flat out asked her if it was a fetish. It is not a fetish. She confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. I found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. I had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? She thought I would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. She admitted she has done this for a long time. Her reasoning, as best as I can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in ANY WAY. She uses socks because it covers her entire hand. After she's done with them, she throws them away. She used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

So, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. It could be worse, I guess. I hope we can laugh about this later. I'm trying to find the humor in it now, but I'm still weirded out.

"If businesses only have to pay taxes on profit, not revenue. Then I should only have to pay taxes after I've paid all my bills and rent.","Businesses do not pay taxes on their gross revenue, they get to go to the IRS and say, ""well this is what we paid paid our vendors, paid our staff and our bills, so we dont pay tax on this"". Great, so it allows business to not have to pay taxes before they've taken out the costs of doing business.

Regular Joe however, pays taxes on their gross income which is massively unfair compared to businesses, my rent, food, bills and transport costs are also my cost of doing business. They are not optional, without those I cannot earn the money to make the salary I am paid.

The IRS wouldnt have extra work to do either, they already look at tax submissions of businesses and see what their revenue and deducted business expenses were, they could do that for you and me too.

Edit: To clarify, my criticism isn't that businesses should be taxed more, that's not what I want. People should be taxed less using the same deductions.",unpopularopinion

I am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. My step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. Can someone help me please?,"I am really sorry if this is long but i have no idea where to turn to get help. I am also sorry if screw up terms. I am a minor, and i am about to start my last year of high school. I am currently living in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

My mom passed away when i was 2 and we lived in Vancouver at the time. My dad remarried when i was 8 and i ended up becoming the youngest kid in the family. My step mom has always been mentally unstable and hates me in general.

My dad passed away \~6 years ago from cancer. Before my dad passed away he told me that there was a trust setup for me with a fair amount of money to pay for my university from his first wife. He also told me that his will was setup to ensure that i wouldn't need to worry about anything for university or need to worry about money. He told me over and over that i would be taken care of no matter what.

Earlier this month my step mom made a comment vaguely asking how i expected to pay for college/university on minimum wage. I told her what my dad told me, and she said that everything my dad had left was spent to take care of the family, and to send my older step siblings to university (she said it was ""first come, first serve""). She also has absolutely refused to help me in anyway as it is ""waste of her time"". I have ripped apart the house trying to find any sort of paperwork from my mom/dads estate but i cannot find anything.

I have tried to talk 2 lawyers who specializes in estates and wills, the first one told me he could not do a consult with a minor unless my guardian is present (no chance). The other one basically wanted a lot of money to even do anything which i don't have.

I have also tried to reach out to my estranged part of my moms family, her sister was able to dig up something with the name of the company who took care of her estate, but that company no longer seems to exist. My dad on the other hand was an only child, and as long as i remember i don't remember anyone else from his family, nor can i find anything.

I don't really know where to look or what to do at this point anymore. I am terrified that my step mother used this money to pay for all the frivolous bullshit she has wasted money on and pay for my step siblings tuition. I am also terrified that if there is really no money then i am basically going to get screwed hard, i need to get away from my step mother no matter what.

TLDR; I am supposed to have money in a trust/will from both of my parents. My step mom says this is not true and all the money left by my dad was used to take care of the family and pay for my step siblings tuition. I don't know how to find out the truth or where to even start looking.",legaladvice
UPDATE: Tricky areas with consent in my relationship,"ORIGINAL POST:  [Tricky areas with consent in my relationship](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a3lqwd/tricky_areas_with_consent_in_my_relationship/?st=JPL470BX&sh=cd0a8bd7) 


Wow. 
To start, I would just like to say how grateful I am to everyone who commented. 
The advice I received was so kind, understanding and helpful. I was so overcome with gratitude. I didn't respond to many because I didn't know how to properly express how incredible it was that strangers would take time to be so kind to me. 

I'm really sorry for the late update. I wanted to take my time and read every comment. I wanted to let every comment really stick to my brain. 
I took time to let everyone's words stew in my mind. I did a lot of self reflection. 
I realised a lot of things. 

I broke up with him. 
It was so so hard, and I am sad, but I understand that it was definitely for the best. I was so unhappy. 
He was very against the idea of breaking up but I just told him I'd decided and there was nothing else to say on it. 

There was so much I left out of my post. My gut told me that what he did to me was wrong. After reading everyone's comments I think I was very right. 
He wasn't very kind to me, honestly. He would get angry when I would get anxious and he would call me a ""cunt"" or a ""stupid bitch"" when we would fight over stupid things. He would have sex with me when I was asleep. He would call me pathetic. 

I mistook his affection for being a good partner. I mistook him kissing me and calling me baby for being kind. 
These are kind actions, yes, but they don't hold the same weight when he's disrespecting my boundaries in bed and disrespecting my feelings in life. 

I think it's time I cared for me.  I was desperately trying to make him like me, dulling down every part of me that is interesting so I'm a ""cute"" and ""domestic"" partner. Ignoring my feelings and needs so he would be comfortable. This was hurting me so much. 
I didn't even realise it until other people pointed out that my ""perfect"" boyfriend was acting kind of shitty. 

It was a bit of an epiphany. I feel better than I have for so long. I feel happy and I feel hopeful. I want to love myself. He really skewed how I felt about my sexuality and myself. I really want to care for myself. I want to fix the ways I was hurt and I want to take time to be single and heal before I find a super kind, respectful partner in the future (or don't!! Thank you to everyone who made me realise I don't even need a partner to be happy and successful!). I've spent time with my friends. Apologised for the way I had distanced myself from them during my relationship. One of my friends and I have booked an overseas trip for after graduation. I'm so excited for it. 

I'm so excited to discover who I am without him. I'm looking forward to the future. I've never felt more hopeful. 

A lot of people said I was raped. This is a very hard thing for me to come to terms with. I understand why people said it. Some of the acts felt very assaulting, and if it was anyone else aside from me telling me that their lover had done to them what mine had done to me, I would also say it was sexual assault. 

To be completely honest, I am struggling with the idea that it classifies as rape - I feel a bit like a fraud. Someone said to call my situation rape was completely delegitimising actual rape victims. While so many kind people stood up for me against this person, what they said stuck and I feel a bit worried. I have accepted that it was sexual assault. I'm still struggling with the word rape. 

I asked my mum to book me in for therapy again. She asked if I was alright and I left it kind of vague. I just said that I was stressed about school - I still feel a bit nervous about telling the people in my life about why I ended the relationship and what was happening. I hope I can get over that. I had a therapist I saw after my cancer and I have an appointment for next week. 

I'm going to try really hard to make my life and my world about me :)

Thank you again to everyone. Thank you so so much. I would've stayed with him if it wasn't for the (sometimes harsh, mostly kind, always eye opening) advice I received from 1.3K people!! Wow! That's so many people. 

I probably would have married him. I never would have left him if it hadn't been for the slap in the face the response to my post caused. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart. 

I'm so happy. It's a bittersweet kind of happy. He was my best friend, my person, I loved him and I loved his family. I'm sad to leave him and to make the call. But my heart and brain are more important than that. 
I feel relief. I don't feel like I have to always look gorgeous. I feel like I can do whatever the heck I want, and it's so wonderful. 

I'm free :) 

TLDR: I broke up with him! I'm happy!",relationship_advice
Update My wife is going to gave sex with other men,"Sorry I posted this update in the wrong sub. Here we go. My wife and I calmed down on Sunday to discuss this mess. I had been avoiding her all week until I could get my head around it. We took a drive in the car, something we like to do for like 3 hours. My wife started out apologizing for how she presented this to me. She had been rehearsing on what to say. When it came time to inform me it just spilled out of her mouth all wrong. She wanted to bring up now that kids are grown and on their own, she would like us to make changes in our lives. She went on about not having other sexual partners etc. What she wanted to propose was that we have an open relationship, where we both would seek out others. 

I told her that I would not , could not do this. I reminded her of the vows before God, family and friends we took on fidelity. I told her how she had violated the trust that I had for her. Look I understand what she is feeling. I know she wants new experiences. I told her our plan as we had discussed many times in the past, once the kids were out that we would travel a bit. Maybe take up new hobbies, maybe some education classes etc. We never had a discussion about this. 

I told her because of the breach of trust and her steadfastly stating she is going to do this I was seeing a lawyer Tuesday to start divorce proceedings. At this point if she said she would not go thru with this I do not think I could not think she could be cheating at some point. That is where the trust comes in. I think divorce is proper, she can do her thing no guilt can be associated. I think equal division of assests, I expect to make no support payments, did not know if it was a thing in our state, its not. We will have to sell the house and each downsize. We actually had a good talk. Papers are being drawn. We hope  to get through this by fall.

I did talk to each kid individually, explained we are going seperate ways. Did not mention the lifestyle change. They can talk to their mom themselves. I will always love my wife. I will take the high road. I know many of you wanted scortched earth but I can not do that, its not me. I do want to address a couple comments someone posted on the update on the other sub. They thought I was trying to manipulate her into staying by using the marriage vows. I got to say that my religious up bringing has set my morals that I live by. This works for me. There are some that say its the 21st century no one lives that way anymore. There are many things I see others do and say that I do not agree with, but I do not try to impose my morals on them and conversly you should not denigrate what I believe. Remember my wife and I believed the same for close to 30 years, only recently has she made a change. I never held her down she was always free to chose. I believe in God and believe in my vows before him. Sorry enough soap box.

Last I want to thank all of your kind replies. I was overwhelmed. I only wish I could have replied to each and everyone. Thank you for letting me talk this out.",relationship_advice

His recovery was slow and he still goes to physical therapy 4 times a week but he is pretty much back to normal now and we couldn't be happier!

He was appalled by his sisters actions when I finally discussed it with him. We recently both made wills and made sure there is no chance SIL or BIL will get any money if both of us were to pass, or God forbid our children too.

TIFU by falling asleep then waking up while my roommate bought his date back.,"This happened many years ago! But it still an experience that brings a few laughs. (tl:dr at the bottom)

Back in college, I shared a room with a 4'9 dude and he was nice man. He would always leave everything spotless, he was an amazing wingman and he always managed to make sure that when we had a few people over that they'd all have food readily available and drinks etc. He was so cool. Anyway, he told me he was going to have a date and asked if I'd be going to my friends house for the night (he didn't live too far and I had been talking about meeting him one of the days) I was like ""yeah maybe, ohhh I see you want the room tonight I got you don't worry"". So he's all nervous about his date and I give him a pep talk I said ""you're a good man, your dates gonna be great and you definitely look ace!"" He was all hyped up and left. 

I called my buddy and asked if he was at home, he was actually at work. But, he told me he'll be back home within a couple hours or so. Now, my roommate who was on his date told me he would ring or text me to let me know he got back safe to the room and to give me the heads up when to leave. 

So, I figured I got plenty of time. I laid on the bed and basically waited for two hours to go by to get a phone call from my buddy to tell me he had finished work. But, I instead get a text message from him saying he had finished work and that he'll be getting home a lot later than expected. Still no sign from my roommate on his date though (who said he'll ring/message me if he's bringing his date back)

Then *I ended up falling asleep*

Again after waiting for my buddy to message me when he's free to meet. After some time passes I begin to wake up a little because I hear some distorted voices, giggling and bed creaking . I'm like ""oh fuck"" he's with his date, him and her are gonna be pissed if I ruin their night now by waking up, ""Why didn't he text me or ring?!!"". So, I stayed stationary and pretended to be asleep. I hear them both get outta bed and lay on the floor (I imagine cause of the bed creaking). I then start to hear the almighty thunderous clapping of balls and I'm seriously trying to hold my laughter in _but_ then I I heard moaning like a Japanese anime character.. which confused me. Anyway at this point I'm still trying to hold my laughter in, I realised I had knocked my phone near the edge of the bed because of my inability to keep my composure, so I decided to try and grab it splinter cell lock picking style. I grab the phone without being noticed and in that moment curiosity got the better of me. The ball slamming stopped and it went quiet so I decided then take a slight peak to see if him and his date was asleep and if the coast was clear.. *Nope!* as I opened my eye all I see is a 6'7, huge bald black dude followed by the deepest male voice I've ever heard in my entire life say ""now say you want more now"" and continue the almighty thunderous ball slamming I see my 4'9 roommate getting absolutely destroyed up and down like a goddamn yo yo waving his arms in the sky like when you was a kid and needed a piss but you was in class and you had to raise your hand impatiently to get the teachers attention to go to the bathroom. I again stayed stationary as possible with tears of laughter running down my eyes. All the business stopped and the behemoth of a man left the dorm and my roommate just went straight to bed humming. 

The next day I got up early, showered and decided to get McDonalds breakfast for myself and my roommate and a strong coffee (believe me, even I felt exhausted after all of that). I come back to the room to see my roommate watching TV as if nothing happened whatsoever. I said ""Well tell me about the date? Was she nice?"" Whilst he grinned and ate his Sausage McMuffin. He just looked at me and said ""It was so much fun we're going to meet again very soon"". 

Now, I didn't want to say anything because his sexuality is his business and he'll say when the time was right (he did a month later). So, I said ""I'm glad you had a good time"". As I leave the room and make my way down the hallway, what do I see?? The behemoth black dude walking down hallway with the look of a man on a mission, literally like terminator as he walks through the hallway of the psychiatric hospital. I took a last glance through the window while the dude made his way to my room. So, when my friend said ""we're going to meet again _soon_"" little did I know it would be less than 10 hours from the other night. But at least this time they had all the privacy they wanted and I didn't have to almost die of laughter. 

TL;DR - Roommate went on a date, brought back home his date, didn't know his date was another dude, I fell asleep and eventually woke up to see him getting destroyed by a dude the size of [Bob Sapp](https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/071/282/bobsapp_crop_north.jpg?1357083029&amp;w=630&amp;h=420) who came back less than 10 hours later for round two. And I'm 99% certain he ate my McDonalds Hashbrown that I left on the side.

How do I (34M) break up with my long time depressed dependent girlfriend (34F) that has no life skills?,"Genders are actually reversed, he knows I've been browsing this sub lately and I'd prefer it if he didn't find this.

I'm ready to break up with my boyfriend of 16 years, but am not sure how. He has suffered from depression all his life, and suicide isn't new to his family. He never graduated high school, doesn't have a license, and has no job experience other than a minimum wage job his mom got for him in his early 20s that lasted a couple years... that was over 10 years ago. It's clear to me he is not interested in those things, even for us. None of his family or close friends are particularly well off or in a position to support him. 

I feel like a bad person, but I don't see a future together that I want. I just wish I'd come to this realization sooner.

We have no kids, only 3 cats. We're not married, and everything is in my name (house, car, bills, etc). Only thing I can think of is he's on the bank account, but I doubt he'd have the ambition or means to do anything with it. I'd probably give him half our money (about 5k), and maybe something for the house... We've paid off about 40k of it. Or technically, I have.

He's finally started seeing someone for his depression the last few months, and I worry ending things will mean he'll stop that too. I still care very much for him, but I can't keep supporting him and our relationship has been very strained this past year. 

How do I break up? I don't want to completely abandon him and take everything, I want him to have the opportunity for getting the help he needs.

Update : I told him I wanted to break up. Said this wasn't the life I wanted, and that I gave his sister a heads up and she's available if he wants to talk. I'd like to sort out logistics later, and we can use our couples session this Thurs to work on any sticking points.

Then left the house. He wants to know why now, why can't I give him a chance to work on it, why can't we work through this, etc. I had to leave, or I'm going to start saying things I regret or break down. Not sure when to go back, but hey its pokemon go community day so I won't be bored (what can i say, I'm an optimist and this is me looking for the bright side)

I'm feeling a bit heartbroken right now, but thank you for all the support and encouragement, it's been really helpful to me.

Update #2 : sorry for calling you fuckwads for upvoting, it was meant to be a joke. I lovingly call my friends that because the word is funny, and meant it similarly here.

I didn't expect this post to be so popular, or hit the front page. I had planned to delete it, but seeing all the advice and hearing so many people with similar stories, I'm going to leave it up. Its not that I'm ashamed or trying to hide anything i wrote, its just i know this post would hurt him. I knew the risk posting online and title is different enough he may not even click if he sees it (we're 33, and he's not interested in relationship drama posts). I'll try to post other updates too. I appreciate all the encouragement,  it means a lot to me and helps keep me strong in my decision. Sorry if I don't have time to reply to everyone.

And if my boyfriend or family/friends find this, I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt anyone with this post, but this is me reaching out for emotional support from internet strangers because there's nobody close I can talk to and get emotional support from that isn't also close to him, or wouldn't be biased towards our relationship. I'd rather you didn't read this.

Update #3 : He's gone to stay with someone, asked me not to touch his stuff. No logistics have been discussed except it sounds like I won't see him for a bit. I've cried a lot, but am feeling lighter for it. Have been messaging a couple people from family and shared friends a bit. They all heard from him first, except his sister who I gave a heads up to (with no details). It's hard at the moment, feeling they're all on his side and hearing their thoughts about it. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I want these people to be there for him when I'm not, he doesn't make friends easily.

I'm not sure I should keep airing personal drama on the internet to strangers, but it is helping me right now. Gives me people to talk to, and encouragement. Not sure how healthy it is in the long run, so someone tell me if it isn't good for me.

I'm tired and think I can sleep now, been a restless past few nights as I sorted this all out. Will try to respond to questions later.

Update #4 : I really appreciate all the support, it's more than I can read at once, but means there's always new things to read when I need it. And I've needed a lot of it.

He's back and staying in a separate room for now. This is his home too, I'm not going to force him out the first night when I've already ruined his life. I planned to keep my distance, but I'm not the kind of person that can ignore my best friend of 16 years when he really needs someone, so yes I sat with him through a rough patch tonight and we talked a bit afterwards. He knows he fucked up. I'm firm in my decision that this separation is happening though, and told him I want it done by the end of the month. If he's serious about wanting to change, he needs to do it elsewhere for himself, not here or for me.

Also I'm seeing a lot of questions about if I'd take him back if he truly changed to be the man I needed. I don't know. I'm not ready for any new relationship anytime soon, but if he thinks he can sort his life out, I'd give him a second chance date to see what changed when I'm ready to go looking again. I know the chance is slim and theres no guarantees, but he could show me the new him and we'd talk. He's been my best friend for 16 years, and I still care a lot about him and think he is an amazing guy. We grew up together and been through a lot. I don't regret most of it, it's just that people change, and I changed. I'm the one that was ok with this living arangement for so long, and I'm the one that changed to realize I was not ok with it anymore too.

And to be clear, this isn't about him not having a job, or suffering from depression, or any one thing. Maybe for some it is, but that's not who I am. I want a partner in life, and it's not a partnership when one person starts to feel they have all the burden of deciding where life is going and working towards those goals, and the other is argumentative and resentful when asked to help both with deciding life goals and working towards them. And is not supportive when their partner goes through a change and is reaching out to find the new normal. This has been our last year primarily,  the previous 15 were mostly good as we stumbled through life together. I want someone at my side in life who will make and work towards our shared goals, not somone I have to fight and drag along.

Thank you for all the stories and support, they have really helped me both in coping and in staying firm in my decision. I'll probably stop updating this post, it's getting pretty long. Maybe I'll start a new one once things are more finalized.

Update #5 : it's been over a day, and harder than I thought. I thought my tears would be done by now. The optimist in me keeps looking for the path back, the one where he becomes the person I need. I miss and love him so much. But I've made my decision and now it's time for both of us to move on, in our own ways. The support here keeps me going, I can't tell you all how much I appreciate it. It's going to be a rough few weeks, but I can do this.  I keep rereading comments, and reminding myself to look to the future, not the past.

Like it or not, internet strangers are my coping mechanism. I feel like this post is my diary now, is that allowed?

The lack of support for me has been hard. Only his mom has asked how I've been, and wanted my side. I think she understands. We were private people, only had his mom, his 2 sisters, and his childhood friend + his wife. I knew it would be like this, wanted it this way even. I'm not close with my family, but have reached out to my sister to talk. But I still find it easier to talk to internet strangers than people I know. Maybe I'll ask my therapist if he knows why that is.

He's I think out of the house for good now. Not sure, but I told him either he goes, or I find a temp apartment this week. He left while I was sleeping and hasn't been back. I haven't tried to find out where, but knowing the guy he is, he left for me. He's a good guy, I wish I had said a better goodbye. Given him that goodbye hug he wanted last night when he broke down and faced reality. I know it's better this way, I can't be the one there for him now. It hurts, but I know it's for the best

Update #5 : it's the end of the third day, and I didn't have any big emotional breakdown today. I consider that progress. Some smaller tearful events, but no breakdowns. Each time it happens, I try to identify the cause. Usually it's loneliness, or thinking of how much hurt I've caused someone. It's hard not to miss him, but I feel a lightness about being free. And I'm still firm in my knowledge that it's the right thing to do. Bank accounts are separated, accounts rearranged, legal stuff like insurance taken care of, and my stove is cleaner than it's ever been. I'm still doing baby steps, one thing at a time. I have a therapy appointment tomorrow to talk to someone, and we have a couples appointment Thursday to start talking about splitting up assets.

I've barely seen or talked to him since I broke it off. I don't want to push about splitting up assets, or what to do with his stuff just yet. I said he'd have a month to finish everything, and figured we could talk about it Thursday. I really need him to take his cat though, she's heartbreaking to look at. Misses him so much, not eating much. She's 20lbs, and loves food. He stopped for a change of clothes yesterday, and she sat in the kitchen watching the door for a while, waiting for him to return rather than eating her food that I just gave her. I try to show her extra love, but I can tell she misses him. And he probably misses her.

I've taken to writing a lot, either to other redditors that reached out to offer support, or just re-reading and replying to comments here. And writing in a private diary document. It's very therapeutic to write it out and be able to go back to re-read reasons for everything. For example, if I start thinking maybe I could have tried another ultimatum, I can just go back and re-read what happened the first time I gave one. Or if I get to feeling I could have tried harder, I can go back and read all the things I did try over the past year. Writing it out and talking to others really does help.

TIFU my first date.,"I'm a very socially awkward person.

So when the numerous hours of back-and-forth chit chat with women on Tinder resulted in a first date I was ecstatic. We had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; TV shows, movies, and what not. After my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, I decided ""fuck it"" and asked if she wanted to see Rogue One with me last Friday night. She said yes!

The night comes and I decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that I wear on a daily basis. Jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket I'd received from my mother on Christmas. It was raining too so I grabbed an umbrella on my way out.

I get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. I wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. Nervous, I walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. We shake hands, say hi to one another, and I ask if she's ready to head down to the movie theater. She says yes and off we go.

Here's where it went south.

We're walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. I'm not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what I did, but I immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. Confused, she asks what I'm doing to which I reply, ""I got this.""  She quickly realizes what I'm about to do and starts saying ""Oh, you don't have t-"". 

I cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. The silence quickly makes me realize what I've done. I mutter out a ""After you..."" and she continues to stare at me.

Without a word, she ghosts me on the spot. I pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.

Maybe next time.",tifu
AITA for not tipping the pizza place on an order for 35 pizzas?,"Not my story, but my brother's, and I'm really unsure where I stand on it.

My little brother, is doing an internship with a large corporation. He organized an internal food drive, in which the floor that donates the most wins free pizza for lunch on a Friday. 

At the conclusion of the food drive, my brother called the pizza place on a Monday and asked about the logistics of ordering 35 pizzas, on a Friday, during lunch hour. They said it wouldn't be a problem, and to place the order Wednesday morning. 

He calls back Wednesday, and speaks with the same manager. The manager tells him they can no longer do the order, as it's too big of an order to do during their Friday lunch rush. He recommends my brother try the middle of the following week, and they agree on the following Tuesday.

Monday rolls around and my brother places the order, and uses the corporate credit card to pay over the phone. The manager then tells him they cannot have 35 pizzas ready at 12:30, but can have 18 ready at noon, and another 17 ready at 12:45. My brother tells him that would work. When asked what to put on the line for a tip amount, my brother responds $0.

Noon on Tuesday, my brother shows up at the pizza place, picks up the first 18 pizzas, and delivers them to the winning office floor lunch room. Then, he returns to the store to pick up the remaining 17 pizzas. 

While waiting for the second round of pizzas at the store, the following exchange occurs:

Manager: ""Are you going to leave a tip?""

Brother: ""No.""

Manager: ""Usually with large orders like this you are required to leave a tip""

Brother: ""You aren't delivering or serving these pizzas. When we talked on the phone yesterday you did not mention a mandatory tip"".

Manager: ""It's corporate policy that orders this large require a 15% gratuity"". 

Brother: ""That isn't what we agreed to on the phone yesterday. I'm not leaving a tip"".

Manager: ""Well then you aren't getting the rest of your pizzas"". 

At this point, my brother and the manager begin arguing, escalating to the point of my brother's coworker pulling him to the side and recommending a small tip (5%). My brother relents. He tells the manager he will leave a tip, but he wants to choose the amount. He hands the manager his card, who runs it and hands him back a new receipt for the order, with a 15% gratuity assessed ($125 instead of $40).

My brother then gets into a yelling match with the manager, and is escorted out of the restaurant by his coworker.

Once upon a time there lived a beautiful Queen with large breasts,"Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 


One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 


Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

AITA for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?,"I am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. Both of them had spouses at the time. My birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when I was conceived so there was no way I was his. A few months after I was born they decided not to divorce. I was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

Both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that I am adopted by my grandparents. Recently I decided that I wanted to know more about my dad's family and I sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so I could get to know him. Well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over Skype. They both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

Well I did pretty much the opposite. I contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. She is now divorcing him while on my mother's side I told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. 

Currently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off I feel like I unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. AITA for ruining my parents marriages?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip,"Ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.

Me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which I pay for by myself, as I make enough money to afford it and I didn't want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.
 
We also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn't want to go through that again in this one.

The fact that I pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course I pay in part for). Also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother A lot about our lives and future plans.

Anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. However, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across South America which she was going to go on on Friday, and that she had been planning this for months.

First I asked if I could come, to which she said no because she would be ""discovering herself"" on this trip, and when I asked why hadn't she told me she said because I wouldn't have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (Which is mostly true)

Well an argument ensued and at some point I finally put my foot down, it went something like this: 

Gf: ""why can't I just go explore the world and live life to its fullest""

Me: ""you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out""

I believe it was the right thing to do as she didn't pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn't have any right to demand to stay, plus I was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.

That night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am I really an asshole for this?

TLDR: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, I kicked her out my house.

Sister's ex-boyfriend keeps playing ding dong ditch despite us having a Ring doorbell and restraining order. Cops can't find him when we call them.,"I'll spare the details of the breakup, but essentially my sister's ex has been bothering us for about half a year now. We're in **CA**. Relevant events since the start of 2019 include:

1. Filing a restraining order and being granted a temporary restraining (about 3 months ago)
2. Ex being arrested for violating the temporary restraining order and being jailed for a day.
3. Getting the permanent restraining order
4. Being arrested for violating the permanent restraining order for a month and being released on probation. Probation conditions explicitly state he is to not contact my sister or be within her vicinity.

Despite being on probation, he's playing ding dong ditch at random times during the late night for the past week. We have video evidence of him being here through our Ring doorbell. We've called the cops multiple times and they take a while to get here and by that time they can't find him (or they don't try too hard).

Her ex is homeless, living in his car (probably), and disowned by his parents so we don't really have a clue where he is during the day.

It was easier to get him arrested the first couple times because he actually stuck around for someone to open the door, but now he's given up on that completely and he does not seem in his right mind anymore. Last time I spoke with him, he claimed to be hearing voices and we've heard him talking to himself a couple times on the Ring videos. He's not doing anything violent, but you never know, he could snap and do something crazy one day.

My sister spoke to his probation officer and told her the situation. He's currently scheduled to appear to court next month to address his probation violation.

I'm not sure if there's anything else we *can* do about this situation other than keep calling the cops and hope he attends his hearing next month. Anything else that could possibly help us?

I [32M] make significantly more money than my new girlfriend [26F] and it's causing problems,"Hi everyone. Long time lurker, first time poster. This may just be a problem I'm identifying in my head, and I know you all are good at cutting through bullshit, so hopefully you can help.

I'm an anesthesiologist in Washington, D.C. and make over 300k a year. Consequently, I live a comfortable life and, while I have a significant amount of medical school debt, am pretty financially stable for the foreseeable future. I'm glad to spend a little more than most would on special dinner, gifts, and things, because I'm pretty much guaranteed this salary for the rest of my career.

My gal works at a nonprofit and makes 55k a year. She's a bit of a penny pincher, happy to spend money on trips and dining out, but budgets religiously and tracks every penny she spends. 

We've been dating for about four months now, and it's going really well. I love spending time with her.

The issue is, I think she's uncomfortable with how much money I make. Whenever I take her on a date, I insist on paying for everything. This makes perfect sense to me, because money I spend to take her out is a drop in the ocean, but for her it would probably add up. But she sometimes doesn't let me or doesn't want me to pay. She'll insist on splitting the bill, or if I pay, she'll try and pay the next time we hang out. I've told her time and time again that I'm more than happy to pay for things, spending time with her makes me happy, and so I'd be glad to drop a couple hundred bucks a month on dinners, drinks, movies, etc. But she always insists that ""she can pay her own way"" and ""she doesn't need to be taken care of."" 

One time she had to miss a flight to visit a friend. It was nonrefundable and she was out $300. When she was complaining to me about it, I immediately offered to give her the $300 back, just so she wouldn't feel bad about losing the money, But she rejected me and said she just needed to vent. 

It's not really a problem in the grand scheme of things, I just think it's silly that she spends money on me when I make more in a year what she'll make in five. And like I said, I'm happy to treat her.

Any thoughts on how to navigate this? I especially would like to hear from people in relationships with huge income differences. 

tl;dr I make a lot more money that GF, but she won't let me pay for things.",relationship_advice

TIFU by chuckling away being overpaid.,"Obligatory ""this concluded today"" - I've been working for Uncle Sam for about 7 years now. I'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day I received a letter from DFAS (the guys who actually pay us) that I was overpaid two whole cents.

Silly I thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which I could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, The man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - It was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

Laughing it off I taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom I work for and why I should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you F-35), and forgot about it. A month later, two weeks ago I get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address XXXXX, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

Now I'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before I ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now I'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. Being the Class A humorous guy that I am, I send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, I kunted et al myself. I lobe me job."" Covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

This was a bad play because apparently Feds have no sense of humor.

Two weeks later, one week ago I got called into my officer's office. Not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, I was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

I'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""[me], mind explaining to me why I received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, They spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so I thought I'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. Patriotism, y'know sir?""

""Well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - We need these floors clean for [reason] and were looking for a class A go-getter to clean them.

"If your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriend/s, you should break up with her.","For the record, I'm not talking about things she tried once with an ex, but never did again because she genuinely didn't like it (although, an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once, too).

What I am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. She had no negative feelings about it).

&#x200B;

There are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200B;

The first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. He is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. I know, crazy right?

&#x200B;

The second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. You are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. Does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&#x200B;

Now, Reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200B;

1. No guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. I'm not saying that a guy should say ""Do this for me, or I'm leaving."" I'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. That relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. This obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, I only picked men and sex because I tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. Obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. If both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then I guess it's a match made in heaven.

This post was inspired by myself and a group of guys talking about our past relationships and the commonalities we noticed with each other.

For me, it was a girl in high school who refused to kiss me (we did everything else but no kissing), but admitted to me that she'd kissed her ex a lot. I dumped her. Girls I've been with since haven't held back like that (at least not that I was aware of.)

Another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

Another guy wasn't getting blowjobs, but found out from a mutual friend that his girlfriend loved giving them to an ex.

I'm not really confrontational, I just shrugged off her comments and told her more than once they're not funny. Yesterday it was more, to my liking, a direct insult. I was just minding my own god damned business doing some work when she asked me:

Her: Hey OP, would you use shoes if you had no legs?
Me: Well, depends if I had prosthetics or not. 
Her: But would you if you had no prosthetics? 
Me: I don't think so, why? 
Her: Then why do you wear a bra? Hahaha they are so small. 

I was tired at the moment. I admit I snapped, I told her ""at least my breasts aren't saggy like a pair of rotten melons."" 

She got angry. Like I just wished death upon her mother; father, and firstborn. She started crying and saying I'm an asshole for picking on such a sensitive subject for her ????? 

My boyfriend thinks I was not an asshole and technically I wasn't talking about her tits so that's shit she took upon herself. Some of our mutual female friends told me I should apologize, her boyfriend told me that's a sensitive subject for her and I should apologize. She sent me a text that she will be mad at me until I properly apologize to her. 

I don't want to apologize as I think I was not the asshole here. Play bitch games win bitch prizes, or as we'd say in my language, this woman ""se lleva y no se aguanta"". 

But why would I be here if it not were to ask beautiful Reddit... AITA?


**EDIT** we are *friends* because we work in the same place and she referred me to the gym we're working out together right now and the women I'm working out with. I do not share my personal stuff with her nor do I think we have a friendship per se. We are more acquaintances than friends. She does tell me some of her personal stuff but it's not reciprocated. 

**EDIT 2** also, the ""technically I wasn't talking about her tits"" part comes from my boyfriend, not me. I know I went to the jugular with that shit. 

**EDIT 3** Thanks for the silver and gold, kind redditors! I didn't expect this to get that much attention but here we are. 

I replied to her message saying that I would apologize if she did too. She told me she had nothing to apologize as I *don't have big tits nor suffer like her* BITCH WHAT. She also started bitching about my boyfriend and how he is a bad influence for me ???? NO ONE EVEN MENTIONED HIM. I think this bitch has a sick crush on me or has her head way up her ass so she tries desperately to not be the one in the wrong. 

I took advise from here too and told her to stop making comments about my breasts or I'd have to go to HR. You know, culturally (in my country) it's not that of an offense for women to speak about other women's breasts. She told me I was a crybaby and a weakass softie. 

I'll post screenshots (with translation) when I'm in my computer so I can edit that shit. Thanks everyone for the support. ",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by calling my girlfriend a thot,"This happened yesterday, but anyways here goes.

Yesterday, there was a Magic the Gathering tournament at my local hobby shop.  My girlfriend decided to tag along and come support me.  I ended up doing pretty poorly (1-3), but the hobby shop gave out a consolation prize of a random foiled uncommon card.  The card that I received was called ""Thought Erasure"" and immediately held the card up to my girlfriend and said ""AND I CAST THOUGHT ERASURE, BE GONE THOT!"" as a joke, but said it pretty loudly.  The shop is pretty small and a lot of people caught wind of my act and needless to say my girlfriend was very embarrassed.  We're home now and she still hasn't spoken to me. I'm fucked boys.


Tl;DR: Casted Thot Erasure on my girlfriend and now I'm afraid it may have worked. 

Update: Girlfriend broke up with me. :(

AITA for telling my mom she's a whore?,"Throwaway. Long time lurker, first time posting. 

I am the oldest daughter of 4 children. I'm currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

When I was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. I, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

This has put a strain on my mothers and I's relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
She didn't even try to keep it a secret from the kids, I remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and I'd see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. As a kid I didn't understand, but as I got older I realized what she was doing in front of us and I feel sick. 

People ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this ""family friend"". They split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

I've confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. This was roughly 3 years ago. 

My mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. They exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. I read the messages and it's very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she's just catching up with an old Co worker. But I know my mother, and I know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. I mean it's been years, why else would you want to catch up?

My new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn't agree with it, it's been years, he wasn't in her life yet.

She asked me what I thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. She asked for my honest opinion about the matter and I told her; 

""To be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy's marriage and you guys had 4 kids. Idk why you think it wouldn't ruin this one, but why don't you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?""

She cried, said she couldn't believe I just called her a whore and left my house. We haven't spoken for a few days.

Today, I got a call from my siblings saying I hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy's marriage was between them. I disagree, I had to witness my mom cheating on my father, I watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. She asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she's selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? Sorry I'm not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",AmItheAsshole
"Husband surprised me with a divorce, cleaned out bank accounts and shut off credit cards. How can I find an attorney with no money?","Tonight when my husband got home from work he informed me he wants a divorce and will be leaving until it's done. This is not a huge surprise honestly, ever since our daughter was born we've just not been getting along. What is a surprise is it's suddenness.

I've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what I made on day-care.

So in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""Good luck with the mortgage and bills, I've taken MY money out of our bank account and turned off your card on MY credit"". I would say I was shocked, but I really am not. He's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

I obviously need an attorney, I logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. What resources can I begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until I can find childcare and a job? Is there anything I can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? I understand it's all ""his"" money but we are married with a child. I don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.

I'm in Wisconsin, I've tried to Google up the best could since the little one went to sleep but I can't find what I'm looking for or even really know what I'm looking for. Thanks for anyone who helps",legaladvice

Taking a bite out of a KitKat Bar is better than 'breaking off a piece'.,"That's right. Taking a bite out of a freshly opened KitKat Bar is more satisfying than splitting up the little sticks. If you open up a wrapper and start breaking these wafers apart, you're not only making more work for yourself, you're ruining a perfectly good candy bar. Biting down into these connected pieces of chocolate gives you the added texture bonus of biting through the crevice between the connected mounds and then being able to snap them apart in your mouth with your tongue. I will not hide this anymore, I don't care how much my fiance threatens to leave me and I don't care if my children call another man their father.

TIFU by having my roomate walk in while I was practicing cowgirl riding...,"Oof

My roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on Sunday night. She usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

A week ago, I ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. I don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. So this was fucking fantastic and I was ecstatic.

My plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so I could sit on it and act like it was my bf. I'm not really experienced in the sex department and I wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so I was going to practice until she got back.

Before I get into the main event. I need to explain the layout of this house. When opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that USED to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. After leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

Since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. However since we got it fixed it's silent.

Now on to the main event. I had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so I could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. Then I pulled out my new toy and I literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

Then I got dressed down to what I would be wearing. It was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath I had my lingerie, I did this so I would be in the head space and so I could I imagine the upcoming day.

At this point I'm on the toy and I had a pretty good groove going and I was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so I grabbed some pillows to support, and then I heard a noise. I fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! I shoo'd him out and continued.

Another couple minutes go by and I can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. Until I realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. I then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and I felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. I heard the suitcase stop and when it did I hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. I was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

Lightbulb!

My shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! I sat myself right back down, turned the TV on Rick and Morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like I had been watching this the entire night.

She came in and saw me and asked why I was sitting like that and I made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and I was just letting it stretch out. She nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. Now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that I was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

We sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. She told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

At this point I'm so sore and by sheer will I'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

The moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. I reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. She does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  I pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


TL;DR: Tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

Update 1: Thanks so much for the lovely gold! It's my first one and it makes me happy! For the record, I am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. I haven't told my bf yet since I'm still a bit embarrassed! But I'm planning on telling him on the day. Also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

Update 2: Since it's being asked alot, the reason I was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. I was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. So there were boxes and all that jazz.

Update: I tried keeping up with all the comments... I give lol my pupper has been posted in r/aww",tifu
"Youtubers are no longer regular people just recording themselves having fun, but paid marketing agents for various companies.","So my son watches youtube rather than TV obviously because that's just the way things are now. The thing is, I've noticed a disturbing trend amongst these videos especially the ones that are about games, specifically roblox. 

It seems that these kids always  play the same games amongst multiple different supposedly unrelated channels almost like it's coordinated to make a video according to some schedule. Not only that they always seem to have unlimited robux and always show how much more fun the game is when you use robux to play. This seems like a coordinated campaign to me and seems especially odd when grown ass adults are playing roblox, which I can't even comprehend. 

Edit: check these channels out. They're from small youtubers and peoples suggestions in the thread, and since this seems to be blowing up why not drop their channels here.

Gay Couple on a Plane,"A gay couple (Jeremiah and Timothy) is traveling on a plane. 

""What if we had sex?"" asks Jeremiah.

""Are you crazy? Here, on the plane? It would be awkward, everyone would watch us doing it...""

""Nobody is even paying attention to anything. Look!""

Jeremiah stands up and asks loudly:

""Could I have a napkin, please?""

Nobody gives a damn. Everyone is sleeping, reading, looking out the window, etc.  Flight attendants pretend to not hear them, as they also don't give a damn.

""They really wouldn't care then, would they?"" says Timothy.

So Jeremiah and Timothy have wild sex on the plane.

Later, when the plane arrives to the airport and the people are leaving, the stewardess sees an old man who threw up all over his shirt, even his pants are soaking in the filth.

""Sir, you should've asked for a bag!""

""I didn't dare"" whispers the old man. ""A few rows ahead I saw a man asking for a napkin and he got fucked in the ass...""",Jokes
"UPDATE, AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?","I'm back like I said I would be,. My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

Well, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

I started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying ""You were put here to be her caretaker"". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.

I won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.

So, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.

I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

We just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.

&#x200B;

Thank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA if I tell my wife that I will no longer be helping with her pregnancy cravings or sleep next to her because she lashed out at me for not finding choco chip ice cream at 3am?,"This happened a couple of days ago and I was really pissed. I'm here because I want to know if I'm in the wrong here. 

My wife is going to give birth to our twin daughters. I've done everything to support her. I make breakfast everyday and I make it a point to make whatever she asks me to make. 

Yesterday, my wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. We had no ice cream left because she ate it all at night. I really wanted to get her the ice cream. She told me that she wanted choco chip. I drove for an hour to find a place at that time. But they didn't have any choco chip at that time. I didn't want to disappoint her, so I got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. 

When I got back, I told her that I didn't find choco chip. Idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. She threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me I didn't love her. She also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. I slept in another room. 

Now today, she comes to me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. But I did not sleep with her at night. I've decided that I don't want to do anything now. This is not the first time this has happened. I'm not a fantastic cook. She insists that I make something for her, but when I make it she always tells me that it's horrible. She later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started after the pregnancy ). WIBTA here??",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by escaping an escape room.,"A friend-of-a-friend has apparently been into escape rooms for a while now, and finally decided to create his own as a Halloween party experience for his friends.

Since I don't know him, and wouldn't realistically be coming to the party, I agreed to take part in a test along with three other random folks that had been gathered for the dry run. It ended up being a group of four people who totally didn't know each other at all, as opposed to any sort of cohesive group of friends or employees.

Our host told us a ton of rules and guidelines. Don't break ANYthing, NO answers are hidden on or in something you have to ruin in order to see it, and so on. He was going to stand inside the room with us, but was to be ignored as if he wasn't there. This was in case we needed any direction or if we started doing something against the rules. He wore a black mask and black clothing.

Immediately at the start of the game, everyone got quiet and started looking around slowly. As I mentioned, no one knew each other - and it was really awkward. I didn't want to be the ""guy who's super excited to lead the group"", and I guess they didn't either.

The escape room was history-themed. Computer-printed photos of historical figures and explorers on the walls, a cheap dollar store style globe on an end table, and so on. Lots of books stacked around.

The first thing I did was look at the combination lock on the door, which had four numbered rollers.

I put in the first relevant number I thought of, 1492, the date Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas.

Lock opens.

Things got a thousand times more awkward.

I apologized and explained the situation to the host, who told me to sit down for the duration, re-locked  the door, and asked the remaining guests to figure out where the combination was hidden. The host was incredibly angry, but only in so much as I could hear it in his voice and see it in how he moved - mainly closing and re-locking the door hard. He didn't call me out for doing an obviously brain-dead thing and didn't say anything rude.

Soonafter, I decided it'd be better if I just left, apologizing again.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Put the first thing that came to mind into a combination lock, ruined an escape room.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Was told second-hand that he was (is?) mad I tried the lock right away instead of engaging with the puzzles at all. I can see how that can be considered a dick move, personally, but I appreciate everyone assuring me I didn't FU. I agree with you on principle I suppose, but I also can see how going directly for the lock was rude in a certain light. The escape room was ""intended to be easier than normal"" for the guests, the majority of whom haven't done one before. Dunno if that's legit or an excuse, of course. Thanks for all the positive responses!!",tifu

Personally, I have an experience I think about often. A coworker (girl) invited me over to get drunk on tequila and sleepover. When it came time to go to bed, I asked where I should sleep and she said ""Well you can sleep on the couch or you can come to the bed with me.""

I elected for the bed.

However I wasn't sure what her intentions were, and we had been drinking, so I didn't initiate anything and she didn't either. To this day I still don't know if it was a missed opportunity or a correct interpretation.

My opinion: is it really ""missed hints,"" or is it ""fear of misinterpreting and violating someone?""",unpopularopinion

My room mate is accusing me of grand larceny. I've been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street.,"NYC. I'm sorry if the text is one big block, I'm on mobile. I don't really know what to say, I'm baffled. I've been living with a new room mate for about 3 months. Two weeks ago, my room mate accused me of stealing 3700$ out of his bedroom and swears up and down that it was me because he has ""footage"". He also filed a restraining order. According to the police report, this theft occurred between the hours of 4 am to 5 am of August 22, 2019. However, during this time I was about an hour away from home and have receipts to prove it. I went to a 24 hour CVS and a bank that places me somewhere else. Not only that but I was at the airport at 6 am going on vacation. This was not me. I didn't get word of what was going on until 3 days into my vacation and was told I was wanted for grand larceny and fleeing the country. As soon as I came back to New York on the 28th, I called the detective and set up a meeting. When I did meet with him, I showed him the receipts and provided him with my license plate to prove that I was not in the neighborhood the day of. He very much nonchalantly brushed me off and let me know he'll ""get around"" to my case because he has more important cases to take care of. However this is literally ruining my life. I have not been home since coming back and I've been staying with a friend. My room mate is literally squatting in the apartment and ransacking my room. I got a call this morning that he broke into my room and is currently throwing all my possessions out of the 2nd story window. I'm a student and can't afford a lawyer right now. I'm about to head to my apartment and I don't know what to expect. I don't know what to do. Any advice is appreciated.",legaladvice
A bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer,"A bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. This means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually ONE teacher and ONE drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. I think it is.

Furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. For those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

Ps: I am not defending drug dealing, I am just COMPARING it to teachers.

Edit: I appreciate so much the work that passionate teachers make and the incredibly positive impact they've had on my life and the ones of billions of people. This post is about bad teachers, but I have to make it clear good teachers exist too.",unpopularopinion
AITA for suggesting that my trans friend wear a towel at a Japanese sauna?,"I am a 20 y/o girl. I am in Japan on exchange with some friends of mine. Most of my friend group are women, including a 21 y/o trans woman. She was born a male and started transitioning in her teens. Currently she is pre-op and saving up for gender reassignment surgery. However, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.

Anyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or Japanese bath house. Basically, you are expected to get completely naked. Everything is gender segregated. There is a separate men's section and women's section.

My friend who is trans also wanted to go. So we all went as a group. Everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but I think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. Finally, when we were in the changing rooms, I quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.

She asked me why and I told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. She got mad at me and said sarcastically, ""Thanks for your concern."" In the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said I was out of line for suggesting it. They both thought it was none of my business. I explained that not everyone is so accepting of her body and that I'm just trying to protect her from comments, stares, or worse.

They avoided me in the bath house after that although my friend did wear a towel around her waist the whole time. There were some looks but not as bad as if she didn't wear a towel.

I apologized afterwards to my trans friend and said I meant no disrespect. But she still seemed mad at me and are telling people that I am transphobic, although I do not believe that I am. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

"AITA for giving my son ~$15,000 when he turned 18 and moved out, but refuse to give the same amount to my daughter?","My 19-year old daughter Vanessa called me this morning and told that her girlfriend proposed to her, and wants her to move to her apartment. Now for context, my daughter met this woman online, and they've never don't ever SEE each other besides a few quick weekend visits. Moreover, they've only dated for a little more than a year. 

I told her I was happy for her, but then politely expressed my reservations. But I maintained that she was an adult, and that it was ultimately her decision.

The problem lies when Vanessa asked me for money. You see, when her older brother moved out and went to college, I decided to give him a little $500 a month stipend so he doesn't have to worry about food (he managed to get a scholarship to cover the rest of his educational costs, so it was just the small expected parent contribution and his living expenses). That combined with the money he saved during the summers made it so he didn't have to work at all during the school year. 

Since I gave him $500 a month every month his university was in session, that amounted to around $16,000. I told Vanessa that I was going to do the same when she moves out and goes to school.

She now says that she's moving out and that college was on the backburner for her. Her girlfriend will support them (she is 23, already graduated, and works in IT). She said that now she's not going to school, she'd rather just take a lump sum, or give her $500 a month too, and just not get anything if she goes to school.

I told her I cannot stop her from moving, but that money is for supporting her education only. If/when she realizes that this is a mistake and decides to go to school, or even if she decides to go to school when she's married, I'll be happy to contribute the money. But it's not just a free handout.

She's got really mad that I rejected her and accused me of favoring her brother. To her credit, her brother and I have a closer relationship (he's always been the studious rule-follower while Vanessa was more the troublemaker), but I do love my children equally. I told her at the end of the day, that it was an *educational* stipend; if she feels like she has the independence to move out to her fiancé, then she has the independence to get a job and work for her own money. That if she ever wants to go school at any point of her life, I will fully support it financially.

Well we argued back and forth before she angrily hung up on me and told my wife. My wife thinks that we should give her *something*, but I told her that my thinking is that this relationship will fail, and I rather keep the $15,000 as an emergency blanket for if and WHEN she has to move back home. I don't want her to think I support this decision.

She told me she sorta saw my point, but she's not going to help me unravel this mess with my Vanessa, she's staying out of it. I, on the other hand, think she's acting like a spoiled brat. AITA for sticking to my guns on this?",AmItheAsshole
TIFU when I made my Uber driver have an existential crisis.,"This happen to me about an hour ago. My car broke down and had to call Uber for a ride across town to work (which is about 40 minutes away). I work for a pretty big company and when he saw the address the conversation started. *(For my privacy and the privacy of others, I'm going to change the name of my job and the people I'm speaking of.)*

UD: ""Hey man, you work *JOB*? How do you like it?""

Me: ""It is pretty good. Pay is great, people are nice...can't really complain.""

UD: ""Bruh that is really good man. Gotta work hard these days, don't know if you'll have another chance, you know?""

Me: ""Yeah man. I get you.""

UD: ""I actually got a friend that works up there. He use to make websites all the time and he was excited when you guys hired him.""

Me: ""I'm glad to hear that. What is his name?""

UD: ""My boy Frank.""

Me: ""Frank...Gallagher?""

UD: ""Hell yeah, he is super smart and had a streak of bad luck with jobs. Then he got hired there and we knew he was set.""

Me: ""Um..When was the last time you talked to him?""

UD: ""Its been about 2-ish years. Me and my girl had a kid and lost contact with a few people but now that you reminded me of him, I'm going to hit him up soon.""

Me: ""I don't know if that is possible, Frank died like 2 years ago.""

UD: "".....What? Nah man. We must be talking about two different people.""

Me: ""I've been working there for a while and we have had only one Frank Gallagher to work for us. He died in the summer of 2014 I believe.""

UD: ""No, he didn't. I'm going to call him right now because I'm pretty sure we are talking about two different people bruh.""

**calls Frank on his phone and the number is disconnected**

UD: ""He probably didn't pay his bill. You know how us black people are with our bills and shit. Hahaha""

Me: ""Ummm...I trained him when he was hired. I'm sorry you found out this way but he was the only one.""

UD: ""He wasn't some young dude. He is about my age, like 40...""

Me: ""or early 50's? Black, slender, short with salt and pepper hair. Chipped tooth? Yeah, Frank. I know him because I really like him. Worked harder than any other young guy I've ever trained. He died, man. I'm really sorry you found out like this.""

**Uber Driver starts to cry and pulls over**

UD: ""I....what...we were around the same age. What the fuck?!""

Me: ""I'm sorry...I don't know what to say"" *looks at the clock on my phone*

UD: ""He is way to young to die man. We are both in our 40's bruh.*

He eventually collected himself and kept driving. Still got to work on time. I took a picture of Frank that I had on my desk and sent it to him, so he could realize we are talking about the same person.

**TL;DR** I, a stranger, informed a friendly Uber driver that one of his friends died and we shared a very emotional car ride together.

UPDATE: I [22F] just found out my boyfriend [27M] has been having sex with me when I'm sleeping after I've taken sleeping pills.,"[Previous post can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bovqbj/i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27f_has_been/) but the TL;DR is in the title. I have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. I'm pretty much dead to the world when I take them. Recently, about 2 weeks ago, I found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while I was knocked out despite me saying that I wasn't up for sex before I fell asleep. I woke up that day because I was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. He didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&#x200B;

Now for the update. after I found out what happened, I went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. I'm so incredibly lucky to have him. It was from his house that I made the last post. After that post, I was replying to the comments until I fell asleep. The majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that I need to break up with him and report him to the police. That was something I didn't wasn't to have to do. When I woke up in the morning, I had almost 600 more replies and I got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what I was going to do. So that is exactly what I did.

&#x200B;

I had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. I wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why I wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. I went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&#x200B;

So I called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. I started to explain everything to him and why I had to go away for a while. The conversation was going okay at the beginning. But then it took a turn. As soon as I brought up the fact that I wold him no to sex before I feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. He started yelling. He started throwing things. He got scary violent. Telling me that he knew I was insinuating that he had raped me. Saying I was accusing him of something very serious. I hadn't said to him that he had raped me. I hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that I was going to give him another chance.

&#x200B;

Then things took another turn. In my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. I don't want to come off that way so I am not going to disclose what happened. I'm still trying to process everything and wondering how I could be so wrong about a person.

&#x200B;

I just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. You have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me I was the one who was wrong. I'm sorry I didn't listen to you guys. I was wrong. But I think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision I had made. Maybe it was better that way because now I know for sure. I don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now I'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order.

&#x200B;

Again, thank you.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Some people have asked of he is now my ex. I guess I didn't really directly say that he is. We are no longer together. And never will be again. Even if I decided to get back together with him for some crazy reason, my brother will never let that happened after what transpired that day.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: It's come up a lot. People are asking to telling me to report him tit he police. My brother did report him. Another thing people keep asking is what happened. Call me an attention seeker if you want. I don't care anymore. What I left out was that when he got violent, he tried to rape me. If my brother hadn't heard him and pulled him off of me, he would have succeeded. It's so embarrassing, not just that I was almost taped but that my brother found me like that.",relationship_advice
"Girlfriend (22/f) slept with the bartender (31/m) at work party back in November. She finally broke down and told me (24/m) everything today, claiming she was taken advantage of. I feel sick and I'm not sure what to do. Would you consider this cheating?","# IMPORTANT UPDATE #2:

I have decided to side with my girlfriend and support her as we figure this out. I'm not going to pretend everything is fine, and I'm not promising that we'll make it through this. Honestly I have a feeling we probably won't. But we've been together for 3 years and I believe her about what happened. I think she is a victim even if she didn't handle everything correctly that night. I'm going to support her and try to figure out the full story.

I've read every comment in here. I was responding to many with information in these updates, but there are far too many to reply to. Most of the top comments were posted early and are quick to tell me to break up. If you read the rest, they are probably split 60/40 about whether she set it all up or if she was assaulted.

To everyone saying that she should break up with me for how I have handled this so far. Please try to understand how emotional this ordeal has been for both of us. She came to me saying she made a mistake and that it was her fault. And she hid it for over a month. I only learned all of this *yesterday* and I freaked out.

Original post:

This has turned into a wall of text so I thank anyone who reads. It's probably too much detail, but it's been therapeutic to write it all out.

**Background**

I (24/m) have been going out with my girlfriend (22/f) for just over 3 years. We do not live together. We were both living at our parents' houses while attending university but I recently graduated and now have my own place with a roommate. She still lives with her mom, but we have had a few discussions about moving in together.

I work full-time at an office job and she is in class with a part-time restaurant job on the side. She started this job at the beginning of November and was hired by one of her friends. She told me it was annoying that several of the male staff members constantly flirted with her and made inappropriate jokes despite her being in a relationship. This includes the restaurant's bartender (31/m).

In late November (only a couple weeks after she started), the staff had their annual Christmas party at the restaurant. It was on a Monday night since the restaurant is closed Tuesday mornings.

Later that week, my girlfriend was also supposed to be housesitting/dogsitting for a friend. She had to go feed the dog every day and was allowed to stay overnight if she wanted (starting Tuesday). We were talking about how we both thought it was hot to have sex in someone else's house, and planned to have a few wild nights when we got the chance.

**My side of the story**

I stayed home the night of the party. I was told it was staff only (no significant others) and I had work in the morning, so I  had no problem staying in. I dropped my girlfriend off and I was texting her throughout the night. At around 11 I told her I was going to sleep and said goodnight. I was still up another hour or so, but based on her texts she was quite drunk and it was frustrating having a regular conversation, so I didn't want to text any more.

I sent her a message the next morning and didn't hear back until around 2pm, when she informed me she was extremely hungover and slept half the day. Even though her mom's house was just around the corner from the restaurant, she said she instead decided to go to the dogsitting house (a day early) since it was on the way to the bar that some people headed to after the party. Apparently the homeowners left earlier Monday night.

We hung out later that night and she showed me photos of the party. I saw most people brought their significant others, and I was kind of insulted. I confronted her about it and she said she didn't think we were supposed to be invited and that I shouldn't have cared since I had work the next day anyways. We had a minor disagreement but nothing serious.

The next couples days were normal, we were happy, and Thursday night I suggested we go over the dogsitting house together. She started acting weird and said she didn't want to do that any more, but we could hang out at my place. We did, watched some tv, and I tried to initiate sex. She refused and said I was being too pushy and went home. I didn't think I did anything wrong and I was frustrated.

The next two weeks or so were more of the same. No sex, which led to frustration and silly arguments over little things. She started exams in mid/late December and stress was through the roof. Finally, after she finished exams we went out to a party, went home together and had sex. It had been probably 3 weeks, and previously we were having sex \~5 times a week.

Over the Christmas break we resumed having lots of sex, but things still didn't feel right. There were lots of arguments. We both returned to work/school and it seemed like every day there was some new disagreement. And now today... we were fighting about something stupid (whether or not her friend calling me ""Garfield"" should be insulting), and trying to resolve it. I made an offhand comment about how these little fights shouldn't bother me so much, it's not like she cheated on me.

And then she broke down. She started sobbing and saying that she made a huge mistake at the Christmas party. She said she couldn't bear to tell me and wanted to kill herself.

**Her side of the story**

After the crying stopped, I made her tell me what happened. I was pretty pissed off and yelling because she basically told me she cheated on me a MONTH AND A HALF ago and tried to hide it. This is her side. A lot of it is pieced together from her messages and what her coworkers told her, since she has no little memory of the night.

The party was open-bar, and she and her friend were hanging out at at bar most of the night. The bartender was another employee who had volunteered to take the night off from drinking to serve everyone else. Partway through the night, he started giving her drinks that she wasn't even asking for. She was having a good time and accepted them. Eventually she got blackout drunk, still pretty early in the night too. She doesn't remember me texting her goodnight, which was only around 11pm.

At midnight, she texted the dogsitting people asking if she could go over that night. There was no answer of course, since they were on an international flight somewhere. Everyone kept drinking until about 12:30 am. Around 1 am, the bartender drove a group of people from the party to a bar. He returned to the party to drive the last carload of people to the bar. Everyone else had made their way home by this point.

He dropped everyone at the bar except my girlfriend. He told the others he would drive her home, but together they then went back to the dogsitting house. I don't know the exact details of what happened next. But around 3 am, she sent a photo to their work group chat. It includes her, the bartender, and the dog in a bed. You could only see from their shoulders up but they were obviously shirtless. She included a message that said ""I hope everyone is having a good time! I know we are!""

She insists she has zero recollection of this happening. She woke up Tuesday lunchtime and was surprised she wasn't in her own bed. The bartender wasn't there when she got up and there was no sign of him. She said she assumed she must have decided to go out to the bar after, which is why she asked to stay at the dogsitting house instead of her own.

Apparently she didn't find out what happened until Thursday when she was talking to her friend. She was shown the picture she sent, which was since buried in the group chat. She still insists she has no memory of anything, and freaked out and didn't know what to do. That's why she refused to go to that house with me and why things suddenly got so weird between us. She says she wanted to deny to herself that it happened and didn't want to tell me.

After finding out the truth today, there has been lots of yelling and crying, and I'm currently home by myself.

**My thoughts**

First of all, I do believe she was taken advantage of. She was blackout drunk and the bartender was sober (and significantly older). Her coworkers all confirmed that the bartender told everyone he was dropping her at home, and also that he was feeding her free drinks all night. I also believe she didn't remember it happening at first, because there was a definite mood change on Thursday, which lines up with when she said she found out.

However, I can't help but feel like she was willing even if she was drunk. I'm hurt and it feels like I was cheated on. It's not like the bartender took her home against her will and assaulted her. She figured out the logistics of finding a place to go with him and looked extremely happy in the photo.

Why it still feels like cheating:

* I was told I wasn't invited to the party when everyone else brought their SOs.
* She had access to the dogsitting house a day earlier than I thought.
* She had brought the key to dogsitting house to her work party, even though it was right next to her mom's house.
* The bartender is a guy who had openly flirted with her for weeks.
* She didn't tell me what happened for over a month, and had planned on hiding it forever.

In anger I told her that if this wasn't cheating then she must have been sexually assaulted. And that if we don't press charges then at the very least we need to ensure the bartender loses his job. She cried again and refused to do either. Since she can't remember the night, she isn't willing to report him for anything and can't confirm she didn't want it.

What do you guys think? I'm an emotional mess right now and struggling to be logical. Do I need to put emotion behind me and support her as a victim? Or is she a cheater? Things were great before this and I had hoped to spend my life with this girl.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 1:**

I spoke to her again today and said that there were too many coincidences that make this seem like she planned it out. I told her I needed a bit of time to figure this out but I didn't think I would be able to move past it. I know drawing this out is probably not the best way to handle anything but all logic goes out the window when you're the one involved in a mess like this. However, there are still a few updates worth mentioning.

* We looked at the photo again, and it really looks like **the bartender took the photo!**
* There were only 2 coherent messages she sent after I said goodnight: 1 to the homeowners and 1 along with the photo in the groupchat. She had a few other messages to a non-work friend during this time that are complete nonsense.
* She showed me an earlier message where her friend said the party was staff only.
* She insisted she had never messaged the bartender except within the work group chat. She showed me unaccepted facebook and snapchat invites from him, and said she didn't even have his number. She was willing to let me use a recovery tool to prove they had never messaged but I didn't go through with it.
* She had the key on her keychain since she picked it up from the homeowners (like a week in advance). She is so adamant about this that she was checking photos she took of her odometer hitting 100k to see if her keys were visible, but no proof.
* She said she would be willing to report the bartender to work for sexual harassment, but was still uneasy about pressing charges.
* She still went through with it and hid it from me, so even if her story is completely true somehow, I'm not sure if I can move past it.

"LPT: Genuinely caring about somebody a lot, does not guarantee they care about you equally (or at all) in return. Some people will never care about you regardless of what you do or say. So don't assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them.","This is something that I unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - It may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear.  Most of my life I thought if I really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. It always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. Despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, I would do everything I could to make them happy. I would go out of my way to help them, say & do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives.  I'd think ""how could they not care about me when I make it so obvious how much I care about them? If I just keep trying they'll come around"".  This was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.

What I've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. The amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. People can and will use you and your emotions. And just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words.

Not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...I'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. Whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.

I wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. I'd be convinced I could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if I was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. Looking back I should have cut my loses far sooner. I should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.

Its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.You can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.

*********

**Edit** I should note, I don't mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return. There is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy (even if they don't appreciate it). But you can't expect them to some day change their minds. And you shouldn't let your desire to please people who don't care about you distract you from finding people who do.",LifeProTips

"TIFU by letting my niece and nephew use my PSN account, and ruining my girlfriend's holiday.","UPDATE POST HERE:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu\_update\_letting\_my\_nephew\_use\_my\_fortnite/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu_update_letting_my_nephew_use_my_fortnite/)   


Maybe you already know where this is going.

My niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. They're bright,  kind, good-natured kids. My niece (who we'll call L), and my nephew (who we'll call W) don't have many games on their PSN account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle I am, I game them access to my PSN account, to play my far superior collection of games.All was well for about a month. I knew they couldn't buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.

But imagine my surprise yesterday when I get this message on facebook...

&#x200B;

""A\_Sad\_Frog, can you check your bank? ""

It was my brother in law. L and W's father.

""W is playing Fortnite and he has 65,000 V bucks, is this normal?""

&#x200B;

My heart stopped. Their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.[I went to my transaction history on PSN, and nearly threw up when I saw this](https://imgur.com/a/qZu4SCN)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**

&#x200B;

All told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. By the time I got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. I saw that the Playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn't require a code. That's **FU number 1.**""Tell them to stop what they're doing. Shut off your PS4. I have to sort this out"".

&#x200B;

I immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **NOTHING**. PlayStation store doesn't have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. This is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherF\*ng V bucks or some other bullsh\*t currency. For all intents and purposes, I have lost that money. The bank can't do anything about it.

So here's where it gets really messed up. **FU number 2**. My girlfriend is visiting family in the US, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. She will have expenses sorted because she's staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can't take part in now. That was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than I ever could have expected, and far better than I deserved.

I'm not mad at the kids. I genuinely don't think they meant it. I'm mad at myself. I didn't think it was possible, but then I should have done more research. I feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just F'ed. We're not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.

So, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on PSN are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.

**TLDR:** Left my PlayStation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend's holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.

**EDIT:** A couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. This is true, but it's set up on a different email that wasn't set up on our phones to notify us. It would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **FU number 3** confirmed.

**UPDATE #1:** Playstation support was closed for phonecalls today, so it will be tomorrow (monday) when I can contact them.",tifu
"AITA for turning the home I inherited into an Airbnb? My sister thought it would be a ""family home"" forever."," I will try to keep it very short so as to not bore anyone. About six months or so ago my grandpa died. For simplicity sake, let's say hi estate is worth about $1.5 million. In his will he said that me, my sister and my cousin each get 1/3 share.  His estate was basically two cash amounts and the other share was his beach home in California. Basically the oldest got to pick which they wanted, the second oldest and the youngest which was me. M

I got the beach house, my sister and cousin got $500k. For the last six months I've allowed my sister to stay in the house whenever she likes but I just got my first tax bill and I either have to sell it or start making some income off it. After talking to the real estate agent I've decided the best course of action is to put it on Airbnb. That way I can still use it if I like, but sister can pay me to use it if she still wants to go there, basically there's not someone renting full-time.

 My sister is furious with me for so many reasons, first of all I know she's upset because she can no longer use the house for free. But she's also telling me that I basically becoming a rent seeking capitalist who is going to ruin the neighborhood which has been a total classic surf neighborhood since the 1950s. She has written me angry email after angry email after angry email calling me all sorts of names. She also says it's not fair because her inheritance is gone for her debts but I still make money from mine, and that if she had chose the house I could stay there any time I want.  She's my older sister and I've always been impressionable to the things she says to me and I'm feeling a lot of guilt and shame for what she told me. Am I the asshole here?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for asking my wedding guest to leave for wearing his military uniform at my wedding?,"The son of one of my husband's family friends showed up to my wedding in his marines formal wear, complete with all his medals. Now, I have nothing against anyone in the military but this was a black tie optional wedding and frankly it felt very out of place and it seemed like he was just trying to show off. My wedding had over 300 guests and nobody else felt the need to wear something to make them stand out.

Up until the point that I asked him to leave, he of course was acting very well mannered and like a complete gentleman, as one might expect from a member of the armed forces, and there were even a few excited teenage girls at my wedding who wanted to take a picture with him, to which he graciously agreed. Many people were thanking him for his service, and frankly it just felt like the only reason he wore that was to be in the spotlight and make it about him, which I don't think you are supposed to do at someone else's wedding. If he wants to wear that to his own wedding then fine, but the whole point of having a dress code at a wedding is so that no one guest will stand out too much.  I felt that he should have known this, since the whole point of uniforms in the military is so that you don't stand out from everyone else!

I felt kind of bad about asking him to leave, but it just didn't feel right for him to be there like that.

Private driveway being used as public roadway and im being accessed for its upkeep (FL),"Purchased 30 acres of land and built a house several years back in central Florida, had a driveway installed that cuts across the center of my property allowing me to exit on either of two main roads.

I now have traffic using my driveway as a shortcut between the two roads up to and including 18 wheelers and other large vehicles since using my driveway cuts off nearly half an hour of travel time between two cities.

I installed pillars and gates on both ends of the driveway and marked it private property but the gates were torn down and the pillars knocked over.

I have contacted the county about it and they sent out a guy from code compliance who looked around for a few minutes and left.

i have now received a notice about not keeping the roadway to state standards and that the county will be out to perform maintenance bringing the roadway up to standards, ie. widening it and repaving which i will be personally responsible for paying for.

Ive told them if they want it to be a public road then fine buy me out and ill move elsewhere but they refuse to do so.

As of right now i have removed half the driveway past my house and put up signs and markers stating dead end road and now the county is threatening to have me arrested for destruction of public property.

&#x200B;

before anyone asks, no, there are no easements on this property anywhere near the area the driveway goes through and no easements in any form that travel in that direction on the property, closest thing is a power company easement along the southern edge of the land.

I have no idea where to start with the events that have occurred within the past 11 hours since i last   posted. I am still shaken up and this is hard to process. 

My bf finally messaged me back a few hours after i asked him to meet up with me. He agreed to meet me at his apartment. I made sure that i was going to talk to his dad before him so he could help me find the correct course of action for my bf. 

Well i met with the father (we will call him X). I was so scared before talking to X that i was shaking. My voice was unsteady and i had tears in my eyes when i walked in. I had no idea where to begin. X looked concerned so he sat us down across from each other. I told X that i believe his son has been sexually abused for 6 years now. Of course, X was taken aback. I started to tell him about what my bf told me. That's when X started to be more and more puzzled. He stopped me while telling the story i knew about my bf and his mother. X told me that there's no way this is completely true. When he says this i start getting confused as well. X tells me that my bfs mother died in a car accident when  he was 8. X never remarried or had a gf. At this point i am dumbfounded and i have no idea what to say. 

X tells me that he didn't think my bfs mother was sexually abusive while she was alive or why my bf would even tell me this. X also tells me that he have no idea who ""mom"" might be on his phone. I take a few minutes to calm down and think before i head over to my bf's apartment.

The drive was only 10ish minutes from X's House to my bf's. I took this time to process what X told me and what i would say to my bf. When i got to the apartment i promptly went inside. I demanded answers immediately. I asked the truth about his mother, the messages i saw, and if they've really been having sex since he was 13. Of course he apologized again and gave me the same story but it made me angry. This is where i lost my cool.

I yelled and told him that X told me that his biological mother had been dead for almost 11 years. I told him i knew there was no way the story he told me was true because his mother passed when he was 8 years old. My bf became silent and looked down. At this point i was crying uncontrollably. I felt so bad for what happened and i wanted to get him therapy. I was willing to forgive him for keeping the secret from me. My bf was silent for a few minutes then finally spoke to me. He told me he made the whole story up. The contact he had as ""mom"" was an ex girlfriend he regularly hooked up with. She was 20 and a bartender in our city. He put her name as mom so i wouldn't get suspicious that he was talking to another woman so often. He didn't think i would find out so he fabricated the whole story up. This way, i wouldn't be mad at him. He told me he figured i would feel sorry for him and stay with him. 

I felt so betrayed when he confessed this. In past few days i went from having a healthy relationship to thinking my bf had been sexually abused by his mother then to find out it was all a lie just because he didn't want me to know he was sleeping with this ex. He tried to justify it further, telling me it was meaningless and he only loved me. I told my bf that i want nothing to do with him and left. He tried to follow and plead with me but i ignored him. I drove home, threw out all everything he gave me, and blocked him (once again.) 

I cannot believe he lied about something so major just to protect himself. I haven't stopped crying  since i left his apartment. I'm so hurt and now i don't know what to do. I no longer want him in my life. I'm considering moving towns so he can't find me. He has gotten online and used a fake number to try and get ahold of me to apologize. I need to clear my head and try to take everything in. I will turn off my phone and computer for a while so he can't try to contact me again. 


[UPDATE:] So my now ex-bf came to my apartment and started banging on the door, begging to be let in so we could talk. At this point i have turned all the lights off. I am being quiet so he will hopefully leave. I know he can see my car out front so it's obvious that i am here still. I want to call the cops but i am not sure there's much they can do. I'm thinking about going back to live with my parents until this blows over with him. I am also considering talking to his ex that he was hooking up with. I got her full name and where she works. I will keep updates as i learn more about my ex-bf.

[UPDATE #2:] I am having a lot of people send me messages so thank you for the kind words! I can't reply to everyone's messages so at the bottom of the comments I added some additional commentary on everyone's suspicions. Please read it to answer any questions if you're still unsure.

TIFU by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway.,"Yesterday I got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. I squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. I notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where I'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. He looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. As a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

Though I couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so I decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. As I sat down I thanked him for making room and told him I really appreciated the gesture. We high-fived and in hindsight I should have ended it there.

I noticed he had his backpack with him so I asked how school was that day. He told me it was just alright. Then I asked the fatal question, ""Do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" He let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. Unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

Her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. She yelled ""Oooo boy!! You told me you finished that yesterday! Guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! You, ya little liar!!!"" His head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

A few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. He looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, I thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" His look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 

Hang in there little buddy! One weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies!

"Update to ""I am 25 and getting married. Dealing with issue around picking my ""Maid of Honor"" for my wedding. Friends [women in their 20s] think my brother [35/M] is a bad choice""","[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c5rn6a/i_am_25_and_getting_married_dealing_with_issue/)

&#x200B;

I am so thankful for all of your comments - I read every single one of them! 

&#x200B;

So, what happened? Well, I realized that it is my wedding. My fiance fully understood my position and really likes my brother and thought it was a great idea. I organized a brunch with my current bridesmaids to explain my position and why I did what I did. I realized that it's a story I've told but didn't talk about with my friends, I thought it was abundantly clear that being 'different' from my family made it obvious. 

&#x200B;

The brunch was interesting. What I didn't mention in my last post was that the person who raised the most fuss was also someone who seemed to get the other people going more than they otherwise would have. We met for a lovely brunch at a nice place (my treat, too!) and I raised the issue once more. The person who was most ""disgusted"" by it, ""Ms. X"" again raised her objection. She was furious and said that this was a travesty and tried to rally the other girls. This time, there wasn't as much of a reaction and the others sort of just didn't care. I told them all why I wanted to honor my brother and why it was so important to me and Ms. X admitted that it was lovely and touching but it should be her because *it's her business!* Turns out that she wanted to be MoH and was going behind my back to get the other girls to drop-out of contention so that she could do it so she could plan the wedding and thus could be MoH/Wedding Planner and this would be for her business. I was a bit... surprised. Ms. X was so upset that she threatened to drop out of the bridal party altogether if this went further. Brunch was tense after she left but the consensus was, the other girls wanted her gone and I didn't want her around anymore either, so she's no longer being included (I will send her an invite). 

&#x200B;

That meant I had to speak to my brother. As I mentioned he's a doctor and has a dual practice, so I swung by his office and texted him that I really needed to talk. He misinterpreted my comments so he kept the office open late and his secretary/nurse/wife let me in. I went into his office and he was immediately worried I was sick, but I told him what had happened and why Ms. X dropped out and that I wanted him to be my ""Man of Honor"". He was totally surprised and confused. He asked if I was sure and that I really shouldn't feel compelled which is when I began crying (I had so much pent up emotion) so he made me laugh which meant I was snorting-laugh-crying which is my usual. He said he would be delighted but wasn't really good at bridal showers so he would need help. 

&#x200B;

We arranged a time for all the bridesmaids to come together and meet the Man of Honor so we are having a BBQ at my parent's place this weekend. My mom and dad are so happy that he's involved - my dad is walking me down the aisle and my brother will stand at the end. My brother offered a very VERY generous gift towards paying for the wedding so not only is he standing as the MoH but is paying about 1/3 of the wedding. We're really, really excited. 

&#x200B;

Interesting story: One of the bridesmaids actually knows my brother - this bridesmaid and I were friends at college and lived away for a while. While visiting home she developed some sort of nasty infection and was directed from a walk-in clinic to an emergency room where my brother attended to her and got her on her way. So there's a weird personal connection that they can talk about when they meet ""Hey, you lanced something somewhere! Glad to meet you again!""

TIFU by taking amphetamines and subsequently masturbating my limp penis for 6 hours. [NSFW],"Brief summary:

I was recently prescribed an amphetamine medication. I took some and expected the typical described results. What I did not expect was to experience a sharply increased sex drive coupled with an unfortunate effect of impotence - however this would not deter me from my goal of achieving sweet release. I was on a mission to give my brain what it wanted, apparently at any cost, and my rocksteady mental fortitude was nothing short of a fully loaded freight train without brakes.  

Ten minutes of sweet loving turned into half an hour in the blink of an eye. Confused, yet dedicated, I proceeded onward. The next glance at the clock revealed that three hours had gone by. ""How could this be happening?"", I thought, but I was far too invested at this point to give up. The next three hours went by as quickly and autonomously as the last, but after a total of six hours, the deed was done, and the ensuing moment of clarity was a grim moment indeed as I considered the consequences of my actions.  

My little man has receded mostly into my body and is now simply a swollen nub which stands stoutly as a monument to man's arrogance. Also, the entire member feels harshly chafed and my entire pelvic region is sore. I'm not looking forward to the next 24 hours.

* Did you use any lube?

* Does it hurt?

"My aunt is taking me to court after my mother's suicide and has accused me of ""killing my mother""","A few months ago my mother killed herself. I (22m) am her only son. My parents are divorced, and I had not seen my mother for a long time (about 2 years) due to the fact that I was living in Asia teaching English. I promised my mother that I would visit her when I returned home (she recently moved to a different state from my father), but about a half month before I came home, my grandfather on my dad's side became very ill and would not live much longer. My mother told me I should visit my father first because of this.

I should also add, that at this time and the past few years, I was very, VERY depressed and had some mental and physical health problems that would not improve. I really wanted to be at my home where I felt comfortable (my dad's house) and recover for some time. When I got home, my grandfather passed away on the day I arrived, and I was not feeling well enough to travel at all, so I stayed with my father for a few weeks.

Later, my mother told me she would visit her parents (in another state) in a few weeks. I debated visiting her at that time, but I wasn't sure I would be feeling well enough to travel again. My grandmother (mother's side) called me and asked me to come at that time, but I told her I would have to think about if I can come then. Eventually I decided that I would visit them at the same time as my mother.

The night I arrived at my grandparents house was one night before my mother and aunt would arrive. That night, my aunt called us and told us that my mother had just killed herself and they found the body at her apartment in the afternoon. I was driving home from the airport at that time. I remember that night so vividly as I could not sleep and was crying so hard my body hurt.  My aunt arrived a few days later, and we stayed together for some time. I noticed my grandmother's behavior was quite unusual at this time, and my mother had mentioned previously that she was beginning to show some dementia symptoms but both my aunt and grandmother were not hostile to me at this time. They seemed like they wanted to stick together and get through it as a family.

After about a week I returned to my father's home and stayed there. I was an emotional mess for the following month. I had a lot of trouble remembering simple things and felt exhausted all the time. Eventually I began to feel better and start to move things forward with my mother's probate and planning my own life, when my grandmother and aunt call me to tell me that ""this is my fault"" and ""you killed your mother."" I was absolutely shocked to hear them say this. They accused me of not calling her enough, not wanting to visit her, only caring about her money (even though she was a teacher with a small condo and was not wealthy) etc. They even insulted my father. Relatives from my father's side called me to help me through this, but I have not spoken to my aunt or grandmother since this incident. I know both my grandmother and aunt feel immense guilt for my mother's death. Especially my aunt since it was her who suggested my mother come to live near her, and my mother hated living in that area.

Today I received an email from my aunt that told me that I would have to go to court. It simply stated that I should call this lawyer. I am so hurt that this is how they decided to handle a tragedy like this. It's so difficult for me to think clearly, and I can't believe that this is how they chose to behave. Any advice would be appreciated. I feel like I missed a lot of details, so feel free to ask me questions if need be.

If you drive down the street of my choosing going the speed limit and upload a video of it as proof, I'll donate $10 to the charity of your choice (with a max of $100). Just comment on this post or private message me, and I'll add your username up here. Once you upload the video I'll also upload it as proof of me being wrong about violence happening to random passersby, and proof of the donation.

Edit: it's going to need to be after 5 pm as well (if it's like 4:45 I'm not going to split hairs though. I'm not trying to make people go after dark because that would be stacking the deck a little much).

Final edit (besides when I start posting donation proof tomorrow): I started thinking about it a little bit, and it just feels wrong to do this. I'm basically turning lower income areas into a zoo for people online to gawk at and for my own amusement. And based on ALL the street view pictures I saw while trying to find prime dangerous areas, nothing would happen. There was never anyone outside, and I believe all the videos would have proven that.

And even if something did happen, I paid someone $10 to be traumatized.

I appreciate everyone offering to go, and have messaged or replied to them all updating them on all of that. I asked that they tell me the charity of their choice and I will add it next to their name if they reply in the next 30-45 minutes.

I'm being sued by the at fault driver who doesn't know I have dash cam footage,"Hello, 

I got hit in Brampton, Ontario in October 2018. 

I'll try to keep it short! Last October a driver ran a red light while she was making a left hand turn  (in a 2 lane left turning street) and hit me as I started going through the green. 

I called 911 but no one came because no one was injured so we got towed to the police station and made reports. No one got charged with anything, even though she should have imo. They didn't ask questions or care. No ambulance came, no major injuries. 

The insurance was easy, 100% not at fault for me, all her fault (as I was told is the case for 99% of these types of accidents, where one driver turning left hits a driving going straight). No issues what so ever, they paid off my car and that's it I moved on. 

Fast forward about 5 months and I received mail that I believe was sent to my insurance company requesting a bunch of information and that she intends to take legal action against me for what I believe is lost wages, guess she got hurt. 

Her police report is attached which includes what she says happened. It doesn't make any sense as she wrote ""he had the green and got hit by me making the turn on a yellow light"" 

The funny thing is, I don't think she knows a driver that was in the inside turning lane beside her stopped and gave me the dash cam footage he had. This footage shows he and the car in-front of him stopping for the red, and you can clearly see her car coming into frame in the outside turning lane on his right after the light is already red, she flies through the red and hits me as I'm moving forward at the green. All very clear on the footage. 

My question is, how can she sue if she's at fault? I'm sure I'll win a case with the footage I have, but what is the likelihood she will have to pay my legal fees? That's what I'm most worried about. 

Any thoughts on this situation is helpful.

TIFU by being to shy to tell the lunch guy I'm not Muslim,"The lunch guy at my job thinks I'm Muslim.
It started off with a subtle ""do you want the Turkey sausage instead"". At this point I'm thinking ""well maybe something is wrong with the pork sausage"".  Admittedly, part of me suspected the mistake then because I'm pretty brown looking, I have a beard, and Arab and Desi people have mistaken me for one of their own plenty of times. Let's be real, he damn sure didn't think I was Jewish (*funny story: I'm jewish enough to legally immigrate to Israel under their current law of return but this is just a detail.*). 
But I didn't speak up. 
Well today I went to grab a pancake plate with bacon and he looked alarmed and of course I pipe up and said ""oh it's fine I'll just eat around it"" which is somewhat true: I don't actually like bacon and I really did just want the pancakes. I must admit however that this was to avoid confronting him on the matter (there was a whole line of people behind me). Well, as thoughtful and nice as he is, he insisted that he could make me a new one and that he would feel bad if I took the plate just to make it easier for him because then I'd be being a *bad Muslim* just to convenience him. Well then. 
This was the first time that he outright called me Muslim.
Did I come clean, confess the truth  and embarrass him? No, in fact I'm at my desk wondering what I'm going to do for Ramadan.

Neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard,"Update: I'll be sure to post updates so please stop PMing me or replying to my comments/post history outside of this sub asking me to do so or suggesting I shit-bomb them back. 

My wife noted that what we think might be his kid comes around most weekends. In the interest of remaining neighborly and with the possibility neighbor dude might be losing his mind, we're going to talk with them before lawyering up or involving the fuzz. Updates forthcoming.

Original post:
Hey all, I have a shitty situation here that I'm hoping to get some advice about. This is in Idaho.

&#x200B;

My neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. A new neighbor bought a house across the street about 6 months ago. A few weeks back, I was working in the garage when I saw him take his dog directly across the street, into my front yard. He let it pee in my yard and then walked straight home. He didn't notice me  - my garage is set up as a shop and is pretty busy, and the garage door is up a lot - but this piqued my interest because it's goddamned weird. Now, my wife and I have a dog so there are a few dog droppings from her that we pick up on a regular basis. My wife had been doing the dooty duty recently, so I asked her if there are more piles than normal. Sure enough, she said there had been a ton for a while now. She figured it was assholes walking their dogs and letting them crap in our lawn. I figured it was our new weirdo neighbor.

&#x200B;

It happened again around a week later: I was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. This time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. I called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  I went across the street and knocked on his door. He didn't answer. We set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and I kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so I could talk to him.

&#x200B;

I reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. Why our yard? No clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. The next time I saw him walking to his car, I confronted him. I simply told him that I knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if I caught him doing it again I'd call the police to report him for trespassing. He denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200B;

So I review the footage from the last few days. Dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. He then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. What the absolute fuck.

"My brother [19M] and I [21M] have reason to believe that our sister [16F] is gay. She has been depressed for years, we have super religious parents who said that being gay ""won't work in this house"". How can I show support/help her without making her feel like she has to reveal anything to me?","I'll give you guys a bit of a background here. My sister has always been interested in ""male stuff.""  Hanging out with my brother and I all the time growing up probably influenced that. However, she always dressed cutesy, was obsessed with Bieber, did a lot of stuff that you'd ""expect"" from a girl. Most of that was my parents, though. As she has gotten older, her style has changed, she has many LGBTQ+ friends (this is not an assumption this is a fact). Her closest ""friend"" is Mary (fake name), who I'm pretty sure is her girlfriend. They spend the night with each other doing ""sleepovers"" 3-4 nights a week, 5-6 nights during this past summer. They always cuddle and are very loving toward each other. Today was when I went from 75% sure to 90% sure that she is gay: my brother's friend, who is friends with siblings of my sister's friends, accidentally revealed in front of him that my sister is gay and backtracked and claimed to be joking, as they know that he is a friend of my brother.

My sister has acted quite sad and depressed for 2-3 years now. My parents are very religious (mostly my mom), and my sister even goes to a Christian camp every summer which I think she actually enjoys. In fact, I think she is in a Christian, but is conflicted about her orientation in relation to her beliefs. 

I feel as though that, if she were to come out, my father would be supportive, but my mother would not. My sister was willing to tell her friends that she is gay but not her own brothers who she knows she can fully trust?

I know I made a lot of predictions as to what is actually happening in the situation, but it's been stuck in my head. My sister never leaves her room, is gaining a lot of weight, and has the pressure of her sexuality on her mind. Not to mention that her friends aren't that great.

AITA for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's expenses after she got pregnant?,"My husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as An. An's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. An is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

An stays mostly with us because I am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. It had always been my husband who pays for An's expenses.

When An turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(HS) in the big city we live in. We checked on HS and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private HS. She has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. I have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

My husband and I came to an agreement that I would also help her dream to come true, but I would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (An did NOT know this) and he agreed. This conversation took place two years ago... And now, An is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

I laid some facts down to An, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. I recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

An's mom is ECSTATIC and so is her grandma. They have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". I think they're absolute loonies; I bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. I believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

I am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money I've been saving in other stuff if An decides to carry on with the pregnancy. I have NOT and will NOT make the ultimatum of ""terminate or I'll stop paying your tuition"", but I will tell her that I won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. I don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. I firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. Money will go to some of the child's expenses and I will give no more. An can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

My husband is telling me I need to understand the situation. I do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill I will die on. I can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but I feel like I'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something I shouldn't. Husband firmly believes I am doing this to punish An and I am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. AITA?

&#x200B;

**Edit/Commonly asked questions:** Ann will NOT stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. I will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but I also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (I still need to make a budget, but I don't think I will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

No, I will NOT make an ultimatum. I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO ANN ABOUT THIS SITUATION. I plan on telling her I can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. She STILL will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. If father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

I will definitely NOT pay for the private university. The country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. I AM NOT CLOSING HER EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. I may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to LSE, for example) but I am not giving her the worst.

Finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. Parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. That would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**Another edit because forgot to add:** Ann was supposed to be on the pill. Gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. She stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. Husband and I have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but I'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point I just want to fist fight bio mom.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by cripwalking out of my maths class,"No, isn't a joke. This happened less than 2 hours ago.

So you might be wondering, how in the fuck did I manage to cripwalk out of my maths class? Why on earth would I do it? Well, let me tell you. Here I am, chilling in class, while we're doing simple quadratic equations, and one of our classmates could not even comprehend HOW to solve it. My teacher, of course, gets pissed, and then she catches a student chatting, which led her to losing her shit. She starts saying how we all copy our answers when doing work, and tells us that if we don't enjoy the class, we can exit the room, pointing to the open door.

I sat there hesitating for about a few seconds, thinking ""Should I? Nahh"" and then thought: it's the end of the year, nothing will happen and everyone would get a good laugh out of this! Maybe. But not the teacher.

So I get up, put my books in my bag while everyone is giving me confused looks (including the teacher), and I shit you not, I cripwalk out the door, closing the door on the way out. As soon as I'm outside the classroom, the whole class is fucking HOWLING, literally screaming, you could even hear it from the first floor.

I'm feeling all slick and shit thinking ""That was definitely worth it"", but then it fucking dawns on me. **The parent-teacher conference is today, in less than 3 hours. AND I HAVE TO GO TO IT TOO.**

AITA for using poop bags for my daughter's birthday party?,"My daughter just turned 6. We had a birthday party for her on Saturday. That morning was pretty hectic. I was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and I didn't notice.

All that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""Sarah"" and it's ""Sara"" and I said, ""who cares, just scrape off the H"" but she insisted on returning it. So I said ""fine whatever."" And then as she's leaving she says since I screwed up already I should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

And I go into the kitchen and I ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" She says ""the gift bags."" I found all the candy and toys and what I thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. So I make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

My wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt I made at helping. So a little while after that, the guests arrive. The day went pretty well until the end. My daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. My wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until I got the box. She looked inside an was horrified

""What the fuck is this?"" she whispers. And she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. I follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. She's SO embarrassed. Why? She wont say. I'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. I then I just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

Well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically I'm stupid and I've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? I tell her ""It's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. She says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

So yeah I've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. I told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said I was a huge asshole and she's mad that I dont think it's a big deal. and I still dont. Actually, I think I'm the one that should be mad at HER for keeping this going for almost a week.

[MN] My ex-wife opened a credit card in my name ($2000 balance) to start selling makeup through a MLM scheme.,"We divorced back in January and it was fairly amicable, no kids and no spousal support. Since then, I learned she lost her job and had to move back in with her parents. I received a letter yesterday from a collection agency. On it is a credit card I've never had before and an ""offer"" to pay off the $2000+ balance for $1700. I called the number and asked what the hell it was about. After a couple minutes of back and forth, I learned one of the addresses they had in their system for my account came back to my ex-wife's parents' house. At this point I'm livid. I hung up and immediately called her.

I asked her if she opened a credit card in my name and I got a long-winded story about how she was going to start her own makeup consultancy business with a pyramid scheme company since she had to move back home. She needed to pay for the initial product, marketing materials and a car wrap. It cost her about $1700. Her ""plan"" was to use the money she was going to make to pay off the credit card and close the account. She can't get a credit card due to some really bad financial decisions she made in her early 20s (she's in her late 20s now).

Unsurprisingly (to me) nobody wanted to buy the makeup and she had no way of paying the credit card so she didn't even try making a single payment. I laughed at how absurd it was, hung up, and sent her mom and dad a text about it and haven't heard anything back. At this point, would I need to sue her to get my money back or would that be pointless since she has no assets of her own?",legaladvice

TIFU by identifying my friend's father's penis and ruining dinner,"Happened about a week ago, but I've been hesitant to post this as I wasn't sure if it really fits. No one involved in this story is a minor. Tl;dr at bottom.

I am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. There are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university's dining hall one night. We were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iPhone. She was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.

""What?"" the collective asked.

""There's some dude's DICK here!""

We gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man's penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). We laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. We looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn't looking. We also realized it wasn't a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. We couldn't figure it out until something occurred to me.

Before I turned the setting off, everyone using my family iCloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos I saved to my phone. This got annoying after my mom started questioning things I had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so I turned it off.

Without thinking of the consequences, I asked her if she shared an iCloud account with anyone. She said she shared one with her parents. She got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.

I've never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. The rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father's penis. We sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.

The image is burned into all of our minds. I've never met her father but I'm terrified one day I will, and that he'll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and I'll know exactly what his penis looks like.

Tl;dr: Friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, I can't keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad's penis shared through iCloud, and now none of us are okay.

AITA for blasting my horn at a person using their phone whilst driving?,"This happened about 30 minutes ago. 

I was driving home with a friend. We were coming up to a roundabout that was clear from my side. As I was passing over, a woman came speeding past from the left, causing me to have to slow down substantially in the middle of the roundabout. 

She was on her phone, holding it by her head with her elbow resting on the open window, speaking into it. I blasted my horn at her, a slight bit of road rage sure, but this startled her and caused her to drop her phone out the car window. 

I don't know what happened after that, but it's a busy roundabout so I doubt she was able to retrieve it before it was smashed into a million pieces. The person I was driving with blasted me, saying I shouldn't have done that and I was an asshole for causing the destruction of what was presumably an expensive phone. I disagree, play stupid games win stupid prizes and all that. But, my friend is insistent that I was an asshole. 

AITA?

EDIT: women to woman.

EDIT: okay holy shit this blew up. I can't read through all the comments, so I'll just try clear up a couple things. 

1) This is in England, we give way to the right and not the left. The roundabout was a 2 lane on a busy street, no pedestrian access. 

2) For those saying obviously NTA, karma whoring etc - I get it. If I could lock this post now I would. However, there's been quite a few ESH's and YTA's with good points, and I'm now thinking whilst NTA feels good, and there is a sense of instant karma, ESH is probably more appropriate. I shouldn't have blazed my horn, it wasn't really an emergency, and in doing so I could've caused a worse accident.

Some people don't seem to understand how roundabouts in England work. To try clear things up, I've drawn the worlds worst diagram.

NSW Australia. Last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. I jumped out because I'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. I now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.,"Long time LA reader here, and I'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. When I'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

Early in November we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend I'll call Aaron (because his name's Aaron and I think he's being an idiot) had bought on eBay. We had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

It'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. I'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. There was no way I'd go through the water as it looked, but because I'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river I didn't want to risk it. I didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. I said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

Aaron decided to push on and started moving and I panicked and got straight out. It was FAR more water than I'd had to go through when I near lost my car and life before. I got out well before the water though so I didn't let water in the car btw.

Aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. He was EXTREMELY lucky not to drown, and I ran down & helped him out. Immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. Admittedly I'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of eBay parts in the back so it's not like I'd have made much difference.

We phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. We haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. But on Friday I received a letter from a lawyer I know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. It's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because I made the car unsafe by getting out. It was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

I think he's being a dickhead. Someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? Ideally I'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what I think they'll be. I want to contact his lawyer to tell them Aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should I get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

Currently in jail over assault. The world would be better without her.

EDIT: I just want to clear up some VERY wrong misconceptions.

I DO NOT think about this girl all the time. I looked her up out of morbid curiosity just to see where she was in life and saw that she was in jail. 

I have suffered a lot of depression in my life because of her (and several other factors) and I maintain what I said in my post. Nothing anyone says will change that. 

I have gone to therapy and been on medication, and had a lot of counseling to deal with my problems. I am not miserable. I am not angry anymore. But I have no intentions and zero desire to ever forgive her. I will never forgive someone who drove me to try and kill myself.

I am happy where I am in my life. I have two awesome jobs and the love of my life. She and I have raised my little sister together and soon her (my sister) 15th birthday is going to be here. I don't think about my bully all the time nor do I simmer in hatred and anger towards her as so many of you seem to think.

She is a total piece of shit who drove me to attempt suicide several times and I am well within my rights to wish that she meets a negative and miserable end. That doesn't mean I think about her day in and day out.

AITA for kissing my ex-girlfriend before her parents pulled her off life support?,"About a year ago, my ex-girlfriend (I'll call Anna) was involved in a terrible car accident. She received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). She had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. I was devastated to  hear her go through this.  Despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. 

After months of visiting Anna, sitting by her, I was getting drained. Her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that I shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (I am 20yo). So after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in God, I put myself back out there. I eventually met a new girl who I loved (Katie), and I saw a lot of traits in her that I saw in my ex. 

A few days ago (May 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. At first I was extremely upset, but realized Anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). Katie knew about Anna and it was no surprise to her I wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. When I got there, I kissed Anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her I loved her. After the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. I kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again ""I love you). 

At the funeral I gave her a eulogy (which Katie attended) and told Anna again ""I love you.""

After the funeral, Katie was angry with me. She asked what I mean't when I said ""I love you, Anna."" Then I told her about the kiss  because I felt guilty. Now, Katie is now super pissed at me. She is staying with her parents and said I cheated on her. This was not my intention at all though, I just wanted Anna to know (if she was even conscious) that I loved her, and would see her again. The kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, I wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time.

The first time, I messaged their security and got an extremely apologetic phone call with an invite to come back for a few nights and a comped several hundred dollar dinner in one of their restaurants. MORE THAN KIND, right? He said they could get in a lot of trouble for this, so they wanted to make it up to me.

It's night 2 of my stay here and I ask a waitress for a sprite with mint and lime, I was clear I didn't want a Virgin mojito just in case that was too confusing for the bartender.. a few minutes pass.. She gives it to me, and like an idiot, I take a big gulp. Yup. That's right. Going on 4 years sober and I just swallowed my second gulp of booze, thanks to the same hotels inability to idk, make a soda?

What do I do? I had to unfortunately go through weeks of counseling after the last mistake. I just feel absolutely let down and disgusted with myself and whatever bartender made my sprite..


Update; the head of the alcoholic beverage department called the manger on staff back, which is surprising because it's midnight. He said he'd appreciate if we don't go home, as he will come in the morning to speak to us because he feels this has escalated to a dangerous situation for both the hotel and me. I have no clue what that means but I'm assuming the video they found of them pouring booze into my cup, then the video of the waitress clearly telling me my drink was Virgin has something to do with it, or the fact that this mistake is the exact reason they even invited me back..... who fucking knows. They just had me fill out a statement. I have the drink here in the room with me. Idk why.

AITA for telling people my sister's youthfulness comes from plastic surgery and fillers?,"My sister is 34 and I'm 40, but since our early 20s people have always assumed she's the older sister. 

I don't know why she seems to have aged early or why I look younger - I was an alcoholic and a drug user in my 20s and probably deserve to look older. I used to joke that it was payback for her being prettier (she was and still is a total babe).

I moved away years ago and we only see each other occassionally. Last weekend I went back to our hometown for the wedding of a family friend we hadn't seen in ages, and I was shocked by her appearance.

I knew she used botox, but this was next level. Her face was puffy, her lips were super-plump, her eyes looked different and there was not a wrinkle to be seen. I asked about it straight away and she admitted she'd had her eyelids lifted and ""quite a bit of filler"". I'm cool with that - do what makes you happy.

She asked me not to tell anyone and I said of course I wouldn't. But then...

Now, I thought she looked weird because I know what she normally looks like without filters and facetune, but people from our childhood who hadn't seen us in years didn't and were saying how young she looked and asking what her secret was.

I was absolutely fine with that until she said:

""It's probably because I didn't drink and smoke my way through my 20s like ambiguousturtlejuice.""

As a recovering alcoholic who prefers people to not know, I was hurt by that. Without thinking I blurted out (louder than I'd intended): ""Oh fuck off - it's all the plastic surgery and botox and fillers"".

I regretted it before I'd even finished saying it, but I thought she'd laugh it off and it would be fine... but she got teary and flustered and ran out of the room.

My mom thinks she was an asshole for bringing up my drinking. My brother thinks she over-reacted and should get over it. Pretty much everyone else thinks I am a massive asshole.

AITA for asking my wife for an abortion.,"Me (31m) & my wife (29f) are very vehemently childfree. We're not one of those nutters who calls kids crotch fruit or spawn or whatever godforsaken name there is, but it was an agreement that we had very early in the relationship that we wouldn't have kids.

Now I've been putting off getting a vasectomy, I did get one a few weeks ago but I was just procrastinating it which was my fault I guess. However I used condoms and my wife has been on birth control since she was 14, so we were all good. So about 2 weeks before the vasectomy, me and the wife were getting down to business and I realized that I'd ran out of condoms, she reminded me that she's on birth control so we proceeded with the deed. I go get some
more condoms after, vasectomy happens, and  everything's all good.

Nope. She's now six weeks pregnant, I was surprised cause isn't she supposed to be on birth control? Come to find out that she hasn't been taking it for at least a few months now. On top of that, she wants to keep the kid which I am very against, she's very fucking ecstatic which shocked me cause obviously she's against having kids too. I feel so damn betrayed in this situation, she knows I'm very against kids and not only that but I was a foster child and don't know anything about my parents so I have no clue what inheritable diseases I may have. 

I really don't want to have a kid. So much so that I'm thinking of divorcing her if she's not willing to get rid of it, and to be honest I might divorce her anyways cause of the crap she pulled with the birth control. 

I have told her that I'm against this pregnancy but I haven't pushed any further than that. Would I be the asshole for possibly divorcing her over this, or asking her to get an abortion?",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong',"This happened about a week ago. It still gives me shivers.

Obviously, I never thought this would happen to me of all people.

I spent a lot of money on the app store and I think they blocked my card and so I had to call them up to restore my account.

A female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. Even at this point I had no clue what was coming. Until she asked,

""What is your most prized possession?""

I froze. My head goes blank not because I forgot what I had written for the answer, but because I knew exactly what I had written. The answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

I wanted to hang up right then and there, but I knew she was looking at the answer I had written.

So, I mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""I'm sorry? You have to speak up sir, I can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (FUCK), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (FUCKING KILL ME)""

""Dong schlong. Thank you, sir.""

I was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

I've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

TL;DR: I wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and I had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

AITA for telling my coworker about the reality of a 478 MCAT score,"The MCAT is basically the entrance exam for medical schools in the US. Applicants are graded from 472 to 528 based on a percentile. A 478 is literally the bottom 2% of test takers. The median/average score that can maybe get you into a med school is a 500. You must score at least a 508 to be in the top 20% of applicants, in a field where only about 20% of applicants each year accepted into all the med schools in the country.

Results for the June 15 exam came out yesterday. This coworker was happily telling people how she passed and got a 478. I myself aspire to be a doctor but postponed taking the MCAT because I have been unable to hit a 505 consistently in full length practice tests. I have an trying to coach her, telling her that she must hit at least a 500 to be even considered as a serious applicant. Throughout this process, I have noticed that she didn't have a solid prep plan, or a good idea of how to be a pre-med student (she is non traditional like me).

So when she was happily telling our other coworkers (and the doctors we work for!) that she got a 478, I took her aside and tried to explain to her the reality of the situation as nicely as possible. Threw in some encouraging words about the virtues of retaking, implored her to hit the Kaplan books and really research the kinds of students the schools she wants to apply to (she just wants to get in anywhere).  I asked her to reconsider postponing her applications until next year. She had already sent out some primaries but haven't gotten any secondary applications back.

She was in near tears. It feels like I just crushed someone's dreams. She couldn't look me in the eye the rest of the day.

Hi guys!

I'm back with the long-awaited update. But first, thank you all who responded on my first post and gave their advice! I definitely wouldn't of asked if it weren't for all the positive comments!

A lot of you suggested that I just shoot him a text and give him an update in terms of my situation and then ask him if we could meet up for coffee (dinner seemed too much like a date) so I could return his sweatshirt and thank him. That's basically exactly what I did. 

I shot him a text and told him that I had filed the police report and that the police will be in contact with me. Then I asked him (in a double text) if I could take him out to coffee to thank him and return his sweatshirt. He actually didn't respond for a good day and I was really starting to feel like I'd totally overstepped but then he did! He first told me that it was great that I filed the report and then he asked me how I was feeling. He also said that I didn't have to thank him and that he was just doing what anyone would've done if they were in that situation, but that a quick coffee sounded good. So we scheduled to have coffee on a Saturday morning. 

Going into our meeting, I was actually super nervous for some reason and ended up being 15 minutes early. So I sat for about 10 minutes, fidgeting with his sweater and waiting for him to show up. To be honest, I wasn't even that sure I knew what he looked like. The entire night is still pretty jumbled and when he was walking me back, I barely paid any attention to him (it was also super dark) since I was just replaying what happened over and over again in my head. I just remembered he was tall and had a nice smile. 

Then, this really tall dude walks in, scans the shop, sees me and then gives me an awkward smile and waves. I didn't know what to say after our initial niceties, so I just blurted out, ""Woah, your eyes are actually blue, I thought they were brown haha."" I wanted to crawl into a hole after I said that but he laughed and said, ""Yea they can be deceiving in the dark."" Then we ordered coffee (he refused to let me pay) and we sat down. First things first, I gave him back his sweatshirt and he thanked me. We ended up chatting for two hours about mostly random stuff, like our classes, our summer, the Office (which is also my favorite show), politics, music, etc. I also asked him why he decided to call me ""Maddie"" when he was trying to save me and he told me he read an article somewhere that if you pretend to know a stranger who's in trouble, you're most likely to help without escalating the situation or getting you or the other person hurt. 

So yes, he's sweet and caring and devilishly handsome and we really clicked. But he didn't seem that interested in me, not that it was a date. So we then went about five days with no contact until I came across a meme about the Office and decided on a whim to send it to him. It ended up being a good decision since we ended up talking until 1:00 am. Next morning, I was feeling bold again and after much debating, I sent him a text that said, ""Hey, can I please take you out to lunch? Coffee didn't count since you didn't even let me pay for you."" 

He said yes and this time I managed to successfully pay for our meal. I wore a nice sundress to lunch and he said, ""I love that dress! You look really good!"" We had a really great time again but as we were leaving the restaurant I realized that he left his phone on the chair so I grabbed it and gave it to him. (This is important later on). 

About two weeks later (he went out of town but we were still sporadically texting), he sends me a text that said, ""Hey, can I take you out to dinner to thank you for grabbing my phone?"" OMG. He's too cute. (For those of you who might not have caught on, he was mimicking how I asked him out). Anyway, of course I said yes and now we're going out to dinner tomorrow night. 

Ahhh I like him a lot but I have no idea how he feels about me. Maybe I'll ask him over dinner tomorrow. :) But so far, that's what has happened. 

TL;DR: I asked him out to coffee! Then I asked him out to lunch! Then he asked me out to dinner!

[UPDATE] I'm pregnant and being investigated by DCS.,"[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5smsoi/indiana_im_pregnant_and_being_investigated_by_dcs/) is my original post. When I made it, I was advised to get a lawyer right away. I was also advised that Indiana's DCS doesn't investigate pregnant women who don't already have kids, and that the woman claiming to be a social worker might be an imposter.

I contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. He seemed to agree that something was very fishy. To make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with DCS. 

I'm still in complete shock.

We went straight to the police. They're taking this very seriously. I can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. I never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. I feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

I haven't had the baby yet. We're staying at a trusted family member's home until the baby is born. My OB and the hospital we'll be delivering at have already been informed of the situation, and will be taking the appropriate security measures. I'm still freaking out, but we're taking every precaution for the safety of my child, and hopefully everything will turn out okay.

AITA got a tarantula so the in-laws stop coming by,"I have insufferable in laws. Father in law is manageable, but mother in law is crazy.

My wife is Chinese and her parents are really traditional. Privacy means nothing to them, and my wife refuses to set boundaries. They will come around every day unannounced to visit my wife/play with our kids. So not only do I never get a break from my mother in laws constant nagging, I have no privacy from them.

Wife has ignored my concerns for years. To be fair, she's in a tough spot as standing up to Chinese parents is a pain I guess.

Anyway, mother in law is arachnophobic. A few months ago she went crazy after a (wolf?) spider was simply in the corner doing nothing. Panic attack and all.

So I got the idea to get a tarantula as a way to prevent her coming so often. It's in a big enclosure in the living room. Asked wife before hand if it's okay, but didn't tell her the motivation. Worked like a charm, the dad still comes but the mother can't stand to be in the same house as it.

She said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. After a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

My girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so I thought. I called her the following night cause I felt extremely guilty. She said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. She simply asked that I never do it again.

TIFU by eating the ends off a chicken wing.,"Yesterday I ate the ends of a chicken wing. Someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so I tried it out. I never expected this to happen. 

I must not have chewed one properly. I got something lodged in my throat. To dislodge it I ate some bread and drank some softdrink. Some pain persisted but I went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. 

This morning I woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. I walked to the public hospital down the road because I was starting to worry. 

The GP noticed I had a ""crunchy throat"" when pressing on it. He immediately sent me off to get an Xray. That showed I have a perforated esophagus. That is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. The ""crunchy"" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. 

To get more information I started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3219576/

They consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. It's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. A few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. They said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. 

Now I'm waiting on the results of the CT Scan which will determine whether I get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. If I'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. 

TL;DR: I ate the ends off a chicken wing and now I'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.

**Update:** A surgeon just spoke to me. I have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. They don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.

**Update 2:** The main surgeon just spoke to me. I'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. The critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. So I can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and I need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue l.",tifu

Thank you all for the wonderful advice, especially the fact that i am allowed to elect someone by proxy to do a unit inspection. I am never going to rent out my room again because this has been a massive battle.

My friend to rent the room for a single night because my land lord never responded about doing a walkthrough in time, and i was nervous. Turns out someone not Jane, but someone who identified himself as Janes coworker who works for Company X, met my friend in the parking lot. He gave him the keys. I don't know who this person is but i am not comfortable with some random person having my apartment keys.

My friend ironically was rejected by the concierge service, who asked him what room he was going to. (I forgot to tell my property manager about this). My friend got a full refund from AirBnB and him and his girlfriend were put up in a nice hotel a few blocks away by AirBnB for the night.

My property manager did respond and was kind enough to do a video walkthrough with me on speaker phone, and honestly my apartment is not in great shape at all. Apparently it stinks of cigarettes and weed, and there was a beer can being used as an ash tray, which is not allowed since our apartment building is ""Smoke Free"". I have stains/burns on my couch which looks like from cigarettes.

AirBNB has not done anything, and her listing is still up (i can't find any other listings of hers).

Jane however has been constantly sending me angry emails, about how i am impacting her financial situation, to how it is making her look bad as an AirBNB host. I told her bluntly the things that i saw from the walkthrough and how it stinks of smoke and we are a smoke free building. She claims she never signed any sort of agreement about condo rules, and i sent her a picture of the agreement she signed, including the condo rules page.

I offered to let her out of the lease, and not pay any more rent money for the remainder of the time on the lease. Skipping Novemeber/December. If she left, and had the apartment cleaned. She on the other hand demanded $5,000 for her to vacate from the apartment early. When i refused she told me ""I will do everything within my power to make ur life a living hell for fucking with me"".

My lawyer has made the complaint with the LTB, and he thinks it will most likely be resolved by the end of December. This has taught me a hard lesson, and i will never rent my apartment again.

Anyways thanks for the advice.",legaladvice

I worked janitorial jobs for almost 10 years, in various settings. Banks, doctor's offices, businesses, gas stations, etc. The women's restroom was always, 100% of the time, nastier.

And had money, and the women DESTROYED their bathrooms. Sometimes I wasn't even sure the things I saw, came out of humans.

Secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms I've been in, were women's. In female friends homes I've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. Dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

"TIFU by using my roommate's ""toy"" NSFW","My roommate and I are pretty close and have an open policy about going into each others' ""bedside drawers"" (need condoms, lube, etc.) As far as I know, neither of us has used this liberty until now. My roommate is out of town for a few weeks for a marathon and vacation and I am kind of lazy when it comes to certain things. 

Due to improper planning, I ran out of personal lubricant so I took a visit to my roommate's drawer to see if he had some. He did, as well as some other things. One of those things was what I can only describe as a [triple cock-ring] (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/3178JrK6a1L._SY355_.jpg) contraption.
For context, my roommate is a 6'2 black guy and I'm a 5'10 ginger. Naturally, I assumed that, if anything, this device would be too big for me. I was woefully wrong.

I was in the mood so I didn't think through the possible consequences of placing my most precious parts in this stainless steel death trap. Almost immediately after wriggling my naughty bits into this thing, I realized my horrible mistake. 

Within 30 seconds, my twig and berries transformed into a grotesque set of eggplant and plums. As with any bad situation, I figured my best way out was to power through. I took the aforementioned lube and went to town.

After what felt like a lifetime, I began to approach climax. For my trouble, I was hoping for an intensely pleasurable orgasm. Again, I was wrong. 

Instead of a powerful release, I was met with an intense pain in my perineum and nothing came out. This thing was so tight that there was NO ejaculate. I freaked out.

I figured once I got this nonsense torture device off my situation, things would resolve themselves but again, I was wrong.

The caricature emoji that was my junk, remained fully engorged.
I continued to freak out. I didn't want to go to the ER and have some firefighter saw this horrifying mistake off my adult parts, so I did the next logical thing. 

I filled a bowl with ice and water, dunked my bits and hoped for salvation. After 15 minutes, the swelling subsided to the point that I could manipulate the affected area out of the contraption.
After another 20 minutes of icing my genitals, I went to relieve myself and proceeded to pass, what I assumed to be, a frothy mixture of man milk and urine.

AITA for getting my ex's girlfriend a Mother's Day gift,"My ex and I have a 6 year old together and we split custody 50/50. He's been dating his girlfriend for 3 years and they now live together. For the last 2 Mother's Days, his girlfriend has gotten me a gift and a card on my ex's behalf, but signed from both of them. I know they're from her because they're things my ex would never pick out and her handwriting is on the card. 

They've lived together for the last year and therefore she lives with my son half the time. My ex works very long hours and it's clear from what my son tells me that my ex's girlfriend takes care of him almost exclusively during the week because my ex is working.

TIFU by flashing my breasts...not realizing I was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job.,"I've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""Early stages"" feels like I joke because I've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

As part of the hiring process for company X, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. It's a lot. I also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but I *really* hate my job. What can you do?

Anyway, I pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me I'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. To ensure I'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, I have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

Now, when I'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, I'm working from home for my current job. Because I WFH, I'm not always the most presentable. We're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. I look bummy. I'm a bummy girl who works from home. To be clear though, I'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

Anyway. I didn't take this into consideration when I opened up my computer for these tests. I *really* didn't take it into consideration when I opened up the program to begin the tests. I only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

And then...because apparently I have no shame??? I decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). This was a super sobering moment, guys.

I really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. So, I stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. While getting up, I haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. I took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. That's when I realized I wasn't wearing a bra (why would I be. I'm WFH, remember?), and the shirt I'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. I started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. I pull one out, put it on. Dig through my closet for that single shirt I was looking for. Find it, put it on. Bam. Ready.

I flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). Getting myself all situated, I went to push record to start the exam.

There was no record button.

Instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. It read something like 00:09:04.

It had been recording the entire time. The whole time.

Me cringing at my reflection? Recorded. Me smelling my sweatshirt? Recorded. Me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *Recorded.*

I had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. For an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

I can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when I realized. I definitely whisper-spoke  ""*Fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. Maybe a blacked out? I don't know. What I did know in that moment, was that I was royally fucked. The recorded video submitted when you closed the window. There was nothing I could do.

And then...because I'm a dumbass, guys. I went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

So. That's it. There you have it. I might now have nudes on the internet. I might get my recruiter fired for NSFW videos. Or, who knows? I might get the job.

TL;DR TIFU by not realizing I was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. I may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire HR department.

[Ontario] My Roomate has just told me I'm supposed to move out so her boyfriend can move in *We are both on the lease*,"Location: Ontario. 

I have been on lease at a shared two bedroom with a roommate for 3+ years. Both of our names are on the lease. 

Due to health reasons, I legally subletted my room for 8 months (ongoing.) The landlord has approved the sublease. I am in a different city with family, currently. Did due dillegence to find a great roommate to share spade etc, they (the subletter and roommate) get along fine etc. 

My roomate has messaged be out of the blue, now saying that she intends for her new boyfriend of four months to move in after the sublease ends in June, and if I want to return to the city, I will have to find new accommodation, as he will be replacing me. 

Now, I fully intend to move back to the city- as I have to finish my Uni degree there. The location is ideal and frankly I wouldn't be able to find something as affordable (I pay under 500 for my room) and would likely have to put off returning to school longer if I needed to worry about moving expenses and now pay 700+ in rent in rando student accommodation. The apartment, I view as my home, as I do not have permanent residence elsewhere. 

So, I don't want to leave. Does she have a legal case to 'kick me out', provided I don't extend the sublease past 12 months? 

Additionally, what can I do to protect myself? 

Additional context: my sublets room is furnished with my furniture, and about half the apartment furniture is mine / all the plates etc. I left those items there because I have known my roomate for 8 years and intended on returning. (Although, they made a fuss about me keeping things in our storage locker, wanted me to leave certain things but empty them of my belongs so they could use etc..  but that's a story for another time and another subreddit)

They have a wee bit of a mean streak, and I just want to make sure all my bases are legally covered, so that I can return assuming I don't find other accommodation. (In the far off hypothetical I found something better, I would give 60 days notice to the landlord, her etc) 

I am hoping this can be sorted though us talking. 

Last- is there anyway she could move the boyfriend in without my consent if he is not on the lease? 

Thanks in advance guys.


Edit: thanks for the response so far. To clarify 

Regarding Lease Renewal: This is our 4th year on the lease, and in Ontario once you've been a resident for 12 months, the lease rolls over month to month, to my understanding. For the past two years we have, at the end of 12 month in july, we have signed new rental agreement's with the max allowable rent raise (1.5% a year or something) 

So I believe that I am legally protected by the lease, and my right to the apartment stay as long as subletting is less than a year and a day. (I still pay the rent, after deposited to me by the subletter and the onus if the subletter *did not * pay fall soley on me)

Could someone versed in Ontario Law please confirm my understanding?

[NY] I found out my parents have most-likely been stalking me. What do I do?,"I posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bbnnqn/someone_has_tried_to_impersonate_me_and_those/) yesterday asking for help because I thought someone who may want to hurt me may be impersonating me by sending messages to my contacts, interfering with my relationships, and causing trouble at work.

&#x200B;

After posting, I shared what happened to a small group of people, who started sleuthing through what-ifs. They thought that my ex-boyfriend may be behind the behavior and the app we found, but it didn't add up to me. They suggested that I look through old text messages to see if I could determine where I went that day (e.g., if I had met up with him and he had access to the phone). I used my Google Location data to find out where I was on the date and time of the app installation, and it turns out I was at my parents' house.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, most of these things make sense. My dad has a history of financial interference and abuse.  Three years ago, he opened a series of credit cards in my name, maxed them out, and refused to pay. He ruined my credit. My mother begged me not to go to the police, so I didn't. Instead, I paid them off and worked very hard to rebuild my credit. He promised to pay me back and has not paid a dime to this day. 

 My parents have both expressed discontent with me considering my former landlord ""family"". They were quite vocally upset when I broke from the shared family phone plan, and opened a new plan with two of my sisters. They blamed me for influencing those sisters (who are both adults) to move out on their own. They are very conservative Muslims who disagree with my lifestyle. I feel as if they tried to interfere so that I would have no one left, and have no choice but to come home to them, as moving home until I get married is something that they've begged me to do for years.

&#x200B;

What legal recourse should I take now? I instructed my sisters to also scan their phones. One of them found similar stalkerware, while the other did not. 

&#x200B;

We have younger siblings who still live at home, so my sisters are hesitant to do anything that may get my parents sent away/harm my younger siblings' relationship to our parents. I, however, do not care what happens to them –– I have forgiven them once before for crossing the line with credit cards, so I do not care what happens to them now.",legaladvice
Girl who I never had sex with claims she's pregnant and I'm the father. Update inside.,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8lc7k7/girl_who_i_never_had_sex_with_claims_shes

She was lying. She was protecting her new ""boyfriend"" who is 24. She said so to her friend who told me then I told her parents. She then confessed to them. She was having sex with the guy when we were fooling around. I've blocked her number and the guy has been arrested.

Thank you for giving me good advice. ",legaladvice
TIFU by not paying attention to my wifes bathroom usage.,"This came to a head on sunday night. I've been married for a bit, we had that lovey dovey time, super close, so cute it would a puppy look like a shiftless hobo by comparison. my wife would always leave super early for work, but thats fine. Some people like getting to work early and it seemed to fit that she would be the type to do that.

Then she started having to run errands at night for some reason. She would either leave like 2 hours early for work or go run errands at like 10. This was fine for a few weeks. Then she started coming home with none of the supplies we she said she needed. I dont know why she needed milk or bananas urgently at 10pm, but it raises red flags when you urgently need milk at 10 and then you return with no milk. That this had been going on for months probably doesnt bode well for my entrance for the worlds smartest man competition, which is something i assume that smart people have. I wouldnt know.

My mind jumps to affair. The love of my life is out gallivanting around with some shit bag, probably with a cool name like devin and a magnum dong. stupid devin. I figured i would test this theory by offering my own dong to her the next time she had to take a late night errand run. I basically fell short of presenting it to her on a silver platter. She declined, said maybe when she gets back. Like i wanted devins sloppy seconds. So i follow her. There is a dennys down the road from our house. She gets out and goes in. Im in my car, imagining how im going to put the pain on this slick jerk while berating my wife. I go inside and i cant find her. Nowhere to be seen. Its just me, the dennys hostess and a bunch of drunk devins. She finally comes out, and has a shocked face. ""How can you do this to me!"" The fact that i wasnt immediately asked to leave the dennys should tell you all you need to know about dennys. My wife starts sobbing and apologizing. ""You're caught, where is the guy?."" ""What?"" ""Dont do this right now, where is the guy?"" ""There isnt a guy."" ""Why are we at dennys if there isnt a guy."" At this point it became clear we werent going to be having a meal of microwave steak or whatever it is they serve at dennys so we are asked to leave and not come back. In the parking lot, sobbing continues and i have no idea whats going on. ""Wife.......why are you at dennys at 10pm if you arent cheating with a guy.....is it, the hostess?"" ""I had to use the bathroom."" Uncontrolled sobbing. ""What....you had to what?"" ""I had to go to the bathroom."" ""We have a toilet, in the home we share."" ""I dont go when you are there ok, i dont like it, i cant relax with you there."" ""A dennys, a dennys bathroom, thats better to you than going, at our home, with me present?"" Memories and oddities start flooding in, our honeymoon where she kept going to the lobby to ask for things, innumerable amount of times she would leave at weird times to run errands, the gas station, the store. I just never noticed, never second guessed it. She stopped bringing stuff back because for a long time she would get bananas. So many bananas in our house i guess i mentioned it, so she just stopped grabbing anything. Her  shame was brought down by bananas. I could have been blissfully unaware, living in a banana filled house that i and i alone used the bathroom in if not for that comment. So, thats the story of how im not allowed in dennys because i thought she was cheating on me with devin.

TL;DR my wife had an affair with a dennys toilet

Edit. Thank you to whomever decided to award my idiocy and my wifes shame with gold.

Edit 2. For the people asking for proof of my wife pooping.....what the hell is wrong with you. You are devin to me now.

Final edit. this was posted this afternoon, at 9:31 pm, after reading the comments she asked me to play video games, announced she was going to go buy bananas and turned on every faucet we have while locking herself in the bathroom.",tifu
TIFU by making my cousin agree to hooking up with me," 

This happened today morning and I am still thinking how to process it. This is gonna be a long rant.

I have another account that I use professionally so this is a throwaway.

Going for a stressful period in life and so I often hang out with my cousin and we too are really close in a sibling way. So, coming to today I live in 2 rooms on the first floor - an old room where everything from my previous flat is stocked and is more of a store room and the other is where I work and live 24x7. I woke up early to try clean my old store room and was rummaging through some old dvds and stuff.Also made double sure I had the condoms hidden away in a box and whilst doing so, a client who had been avoiding paying me called - I dropped everything and got into the call which ended with me throwing away my phone and the tempered glass cracks. No worries, I got another one- meanwhile cousin was laughing away hysterically at me. I was trying to get the new temper on and realized I need to wipe it, given how lazy I am I asked her to go get some wet wipes from the other room and told her which box had it. She went and disappeared for nearly half an hour. Given, how absent minded she can be I did not think anything of it and kept the phone aside for now.

Later, she comes to the room with a very serious look, somewhat teary eyes and asked me if I really wanted this ? I said ""Yes, I have been waiting forever for this"" and I mimicked her serious tone just for kicks. Next thing I know she has jumped on top of me and is kissing me - not the brotherly kiss btw and I sat there all frozen and for some reason I did not move a muscle to throw her off me. I just froze. she starts stripping and i said something like why/how...its a bit foggy there. She says see saw the strawberry condoms, the adele dvd and the old box had this Pretty please designed on it. strawberry is her favourite and adele is her weakness. So, my poor cousin struggled with the moral dilemma for a good 30 minutes before coming to me to ask me and I stupidly said yes. I put the condoms instead of the wet wipes (both have some bluish covers) That stupid adele album is here favourite.

Thankfully, before she could disrobe and this went any further, we heard my mother shouting from below that lunch is ready. I quickly made my exit without blinking for a second and had my lunch without choking myself. Mom dragged my cousin to the market for some shopping and my cousin told me with great sadness in her voice ""I am there for you""

I am writing this now knowing I might have messed up my relationship with her forever.

I know I will tell her the truth when she comes back but such a series of coincidences is too hard to be believed

TL;DR : Sent cousin to get wet wipes, had mixed up old stuff earlier, gave her all the signals that I wanted to hookup with her and she agreed. Kill me now someone pls.",tifu

Update: AITA for shutting down all black names because I think it'll make my son's life harder?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

I posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and I were having with our baby's name. We had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. My husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black American culture. I wanted a more neutral name since I am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. We found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. His name will be....

Miles Trayvon

We thought it was a perfect compromise. My husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""Tray"" to most of them. When he's in school his name will just be listed as Miles (last name). He can officially be Miles T. (Last name) if he doesn't want to use Trayvon but he can also easily go by Trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. This option gives him the choice, which my husband and I agreed was important. My husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. He talked about how in 8 Mile Eminem's character says something like, ""This guy's a gangsta? His real name is Clarence."" That's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. He's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

I had the opposite experience. My mom is white and my dad is black. They decided on a stereotypical black name and I think it made my life harder. Professional I go by a nickname and I do personally as well. When talking about it with my husband I realized it started early. I remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. A woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma I was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. Instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""Her name is Daisy."" I attended an HBCU and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. For example, Raquan Smith would put ""Ray Smith"", Demarcus Jones would put ""Marcus Jones"", Keshawnda Nelson would put ""Shawna Nelson"", etc. They said you had to play within the system and I did that.

Anyway, sorry for the long update. I just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. We didn't really get deep into it until after I posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. Before anyone says it, I do realize some people will connect Trayvon to Trayvon Martin. That's not why we are using it. I posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but I don't mean to offend anyone. It's a family name on my husband's side.

Reddit not covering the Sri Lanka bombings the same way it covered the New Zealand shootings is dirty politics.,"The 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few Muslims. They carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

Evil is evil. Stop blocking breaking news.






Edit: I would like to clarify. 
I am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-Christian, or anti/pro Islam.

I am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, I had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as Notre Dame or New Zealand massacres. 

I don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case Muslims. It could have been extremist Christians and I would say the same thing about them. 

Humans really are the greatest risk to humanity. Stop the violence and protect the planet. Why is it so hard for some people to not be shitty?",unpopularopinion
My(25M) girlfriend(26F) wants me to have sex with her best friend(26F),"For starters, I love my girlfriend more than anything. Our year together has been the best time of my life, and I hope I can call her my wife one day because she's the best thing this planet has to offer, bar none. She's so ridiculously selfless it's a joke.


Her best friends boyfriend left her a month ago after cheating on her with multiple different women. She's not in a good place to say the least. My girlfriend is spending a hell of a lot of time with her recently and not so much with me. (Which is fine in my eyes, her best friend is in a crisis right now and she's being supportive.) My girlfriend said to her that she would ask me if I could spend a night with her to help her feel better, which was my girlfriends idea.


Yesterday night we were together and she was talking about her friend with me and she was saying that she was lonely, felt rejected, and is desperate for attention. My girlfriend asked me if I found her friend at all attractive and I was a little taken back by it but she's a good looking girl (not as good looking as my girlfriend obviously) so I was kind of what just like 'yeah, sure'. She explained to me that she would ask me if I would sleep with her once just to help her feel better, and she went on to say that she's not only OK with it, but she really wants me to do this, going as far as to say 'please, do it for me if not for her'. She promised me that she's OK with it and she won't get jealous or anything. I told her I would think about it.


I guess I wouldn't mind just the once but I don't want to be pimped out every time her friend feels a little upset or lonely, I'm not just some toy to be shared. On one hand I would like to help but on the other hand this seems kind of out there. What would you do in this situation?


TLDR: Girlfriend wants me to have sex with her best friend to help her cope with a breakup, she seems fine with it and is encouraging me to do so. What would you do?
