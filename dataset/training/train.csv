"my girlfriend's dad just cut his thumb off with a bandsaw while working on a project. he is currently in surgery to have it reattached. what are some puns or jokes i can make when we see him this sunday?. for the record, he loves dark humor and stupid puns. this isn't going to make him hate me. 

i have already decided when i see him, i'll be giving him a thumbs up and saying something like ""on the other hand, you're going to have a cool scar.""

what other stupid puns or dark jokes can be made about him cutting his thumb off?

it was his left thumb, if that helps.",7
"my 30 m wife 30 f lied to me about where she was yesterday.. update: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/al02i9/update_my_30m_wife_30f_lied_to_me_about_where_she

i hate that i'm having to write this but here it goes.

my wife of 6 years and partner of 14 has been studying a lot lately for a certification she wants to get related to her job. she mostly studys at home but will often go to a library or starbucks if she really needs to focus. we aren't the kind of people that are incredibly co-dependent and we each have our own set of friends and time for ourselves that the other understands.

this does require quite a lot of trust as i've found that people that get exceedingly jealous of their partners are usually the ones that are the most dependent/controlling of them. well yesterday that trust was shaken a bit for me.

my wife told me that after work she was going to study and then head to the gym. she has a scheduled class at her gym and didn't want to run all the way home and all the way back in the snow and ice so she was just going to study at the library and then head over.

it occurred to me after a few hours though that yesterday was mlk day and all the library's were closed. no big deal, i figured she'd just go to a panera or something and then head to her class. when she gets home, she's in her full gym outfit but she's still in full makeup and runs right upstairs to take a shower. i asked her how her day went and she said ""it was good. the library was good, i got a lot done and the gym was difficult today which i liked."" i didn't say anything to her about the library being closed and thought the whole thing was odd. while she was in the shower i decided to get on facebook because the gym that she goes to has a page and they put updates with pictures on there for marketing and what not.

there were only 4 people in the class other than the instructor and my wife wasn't in any of them.

i haven't said anything to her about it yet and i can't help but suspect the worst. it is very unlike her to hop in the shower right after getting home like that, she usually eats dinner and then hops in really late at night. anyway, i don't really know what to do or how to bring it up to her without sounding paranoid.

edit 1: i called the library and they confirmed they were closed yesterday. the gym is also really a kickboxing fitness thing and it's only one big room with a bunch of heavy bags - the pics were from when my wife said she was there and she's definitely not in any of them.

edit 2: so i came home for lunch after reading all the messages. pretty much half of you are saying talk to her and the other half saying ""collect more evidence"". so i'm torn. 

i did, while i'm here at the house, peak into her gym bag and found this http://i.imgur.com/dnq74ds.jpg . there are some gym gloves, hand wraps, sunglasses, headphones... and sexy red underwear. i don't know what the logical explanation for it would be other than the obvious... this sucks. 

morning update: wow... so thanks to everyone who reached out about this. it was impossible to read all the comments and reply to every message but i really appreciate it.

i decided not to confront my wife about this last night and instead confide in my best friend who i've know practically my whole life. he was on the ""wait it out, collect evidence"" bandwagon. i haven't begun to do that yet but i will in the next few days.

last night she did tell me that she was going to do the study/gym thing again today and would be back around the same time as monday. again, this is somewhat typical for her. i have a second job that i work tuesday / thursday and so m/w are usually her gym days. what is a little strange is the studying away from home again. she does is sometimes but it's rare and i can't remember when she left to study back to back away from home. she gets off work around 3:00 each day and the gym class ends around 7:30, so she's got 4.5 hours to do whatever if she wanted. 

addressing some of the most popular comments from the comment section.

1. ""how do you know that she wasn't just at a boudoir thing"". i guess anything is possible, we don't live in the largest town and there is only one place i could find online that even advertises that they do stuff like that. i doubt they would give out any information but it just doesn't seem realistic that this is the answer. that's a lot of trouble and lying to go through just to take some pictures. the other part is that i am going out of town this weekend, leaving friday night and returning sunday and she will be all alone to do whatever she wants. if she was doing a boudoir thing she wouldve waited until my trip that has been planned for a while and not do it on a holiday.

2. the gym photo. i do know the photo is from monday 100%, there are hashtags and other things on the facebook post that solidify that. i also checked their instagram later and there were more pictures from monday as well. however it could be from a different time of day as you guys have suggested and not when she said she was there.


i will say for some added context that she has seemed different the past few months, especially sexually. i don't want to get too graphic or anything but she's kind of become fixated on doing new things and being more provocative. i honestly feel like an affair is the only answer. that's all for now, i might update in a few weeks if anything changes. thanks guys. 

oh and shoutout to u/vh3m for saying she couldn't be cheating because ""she is fat and no one would want to sleep with that hippo."" you sound nice.

"by making my boyfriend a tinder account. okay so necessary this actually happened in the last couple of weeks. basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. 

obviously i think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though i've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. so, for some stupid reason, i decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. i set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

after a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after i showed this to him, i saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

queue my surprise when a couple of days later i check the tinder account i had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and i could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

i confronted him and he denied it but i mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity i checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. so now the tinder i made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

tl;dr: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

edit: wow i did not expect this to blow up! thank you so much for the gold and silver and for your kind, kind words. it honestly touches me how absolutely lovely thousands of strangers can be. 

also, if anyone needs help with their tinder, hmu lol because i'm apparently pretty good at it.

"update - phd student here being accused of plagiarism. only that it's my own work that i used. massachusetts.. i posted earlier(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n6lrr/phd_student_here_being_accused_of_plagiarism_only/) about a plagiarism situation with the university in my phd thesis.

to make it short, a few sentences in the thesis was too similar to what i had said in a couple of papers and my masters thesis. this wasn't a direct copy & paste, and  it was 7 sentences (53 words) out of my thesis which was a little over 95,000 words.

last week i got an automated email that an investigation has been started on the recommendation of the person that i talked to. the email explained that in case scientific misconduct is found, i will have a chance to defend my case to the board and the board will decide what to do, which vary from a simple revision and resubmission to presenting the case to the diciplinary committee for a serious offense.

i asked for appointments with a few people. head of the department, dean of students, and a head tutor to ask for advice. i haven't managed to see any of them yet.

today, i received an email that the investigation is over and they have found no evidence of misconduct or plagiarism. they apologized for the stress that this has caused. a little later, i received another email from the head of the committee personally apologizing for this mess, and explaining that the officer who i talked to had gone fishing rather than doing the standard practice which is not the policy.

so that's that. now i can graduate in peace. i cancelled the appointments and decided not to pursue the potential racism situation as there's no point anymore. thanks all for advice. ",2
"by asking too much from my gf's mom. this actually happened today.

so my gf and her mother haven't spoken much in the last few years. she lives up in ohio and we reside in florida. well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.

the last time she visited, she saw an old wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the wii tennis game. i always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

now to the fuck up.

i thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working wii and wii sports game for the next time she visits.

so i text her: 

me: hey, guess what you can do next time you visit?

her: what's that?

me: bowl me! if you think you stand a chance. >:)

her: excuse me?

me: you heard me, lol.

so 20 minutes or so go by, and my gf calls me, laughing hysterically.

i never said ""bowl me"" oh no dear reddit, i wrote ""blow me""

luckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.

tl;dr: got wii sports for gf's mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of bowl me.",4
"by looking up my school bully. so a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn't speak the language when i was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. i struggled like hell because i didn't speak a single word of english. the school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while i was there). anyway, i tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. one guy just completely hated my guts from day one. no idea why or what i did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people's property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he's probably been involved in it. so that's he kind of person i'm talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my english in class, in front of the teachers and all. there was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while i was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. i naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. when to leave school and which exist to use. where to sit in class etc. once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. literally couldn't do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. i just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  the only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. i would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. karma has to work right? the world can't be that unfair. 

fast forward 15 years. i haven't kept in contact with anyone from that school. i didn't make any friends and i didn't develop stockholm's. i looked him up on facebook. 

he owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. he lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. he is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. this has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and i just can't get over the bullshit i was fed, karma will get him for you. i think karma missed.

"by stripping in front of my girlfriends bff's nsfw. it's as stupid as it sounds.

yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her bffs. they usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

around that time i'm usually at the gym so to not disturb them. but yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so i went there an hour earlier.

sometimes after i come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
so i come home early and hear the tv running and i assumed, that she didn't hear me.
that's when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

i busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. some get red and look away, some stare at me like they've never seen a man's privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved wtf. 

the silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. i uttered a loud fuck and she instantly replied with: „good plan, bad execution."" her friends all laughed and even i had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

i even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

regarding therapy, i have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. y'all were right. can't hurt to give it a try, maybe i was unlucky with my former therapists. but i already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. and the girl who i talked to i've cut off completely. my gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. didn't realize she was into me. we're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. i was lost but i know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. i'm with her till the end. we're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. we're doing very well now. she knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. hope everyone here has a great day. thanks.

"this morning i (27m) found out my gf (27f) cheated on me, where to go from here?. so our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but i asked my boss if i could come in late as i had some stuff i had to do. however i went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. she gave me a key to her apartment and when i went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




as soon as i walked in she saw me and burst into tears. the guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. i freaked out at first and the guy left. she kept asking what are you doing here, i thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. i tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



i took the flowers and the gift and left. i'm sitting at work right now because if i went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





we've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. i was looking up rings. she said it's because i was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. she thought i wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. i asked if there were any others but she said no. idk what to believe at this point. 




the kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. we had lunch and got a hotel room together. we had dinner at my place with my folks and i dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. i trusted her for fucks sake.




 how and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? what am i supposed to do from here?

"ne & co my mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. can she do that?. for some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. she has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since i've moved out for college. she demands access to absolutely everything i have. this will be important later.

&#x200b;

i'm 18 years old, and i'm a college freshman. i go to college in colorado, but i was born and raised in nebraska. in nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. it was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. like i said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when i do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200b;

my mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. email, whatsapp, facebook (even though i haven't used it in years), twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if i don't give it to her. in the past, i've rolled over and taken it. it was a survival mechanism more than anything. if i'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. she justifies this by claiming that because i have autism, i can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200b;

about a month ago, i changed all my passwords. sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that i need to give her my new passwords. i tell her no. this is where trouble begins.

&#x200b;

over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. she's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. a week ago, she showed up here and i had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. that pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200b;

recently, though, as in last night, i was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" i asked her to clarify and she said that because i'm still a minor in nebraska, and i'm a resident of nebraska, i have to abide by nebraska's laws and as such, i am still a minor and she can do that. i wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like i wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as i've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. it's not nice. i do not want to be gooned and taken home. i don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200b;

so the question is this: can she do that? is the fugitive slave act not dead after all? does my having autism change the circumstances any? if all else fails, what can i do to protect myself?",2

"update, my son took the boba fett figure.. so, i never honestly expected the post i made to get where it did. i also never expected the barrage of support and hate. i will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.

&#x200b;

so, why am i back? well, because i feel like i need to be. i'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how i acted or seek validation. i'm here because i feel that for myself i need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200b;

so, i want to talk about something first before i get into the update. many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how i reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. i was also hit pretty hard for how i was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. to give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. we have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. we're just to different in some senses. he's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. in these past few years we've tried to fix this. work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. during our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and i wont lie i never understood the appeal. it is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200b;

so, when my son stole and damaged his property i didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. so when he asked for 2,000 to fix it i really didn't feel like it was worth it. was this wrong of me? maybe. i don't feel bad about defending my son, i only feel bad that i discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200b;

sorry about that. like i said, i don't want sympathy. i only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

so, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. i had no idea what i was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. we collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. during this time i got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. i offered to pay in full.

(also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so i asked him. he had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

my brother said he plans to not sue us. his renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. at first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. this was the plan until last night.

during the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. it turns out my son stole the figure to sell. he had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. he didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

suffice to say, i am not happy about this. i won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. my brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly i think this might be for the best in the end. the way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and i believe the only option that i can live with myself making is this. i will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

so, thank you all for the advice. the support and hate are what i needed as a true wake up call. like i said, i don't need pity. i'm doing this so that i can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.",2
"for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?. this happened a couple weeks ago, but i'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

i travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. most recently, i was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. this wouldn't be a problem except that i had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket i paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way i had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (because i take this specific route and airline a lot, i knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since i just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

of course, when it came time to board, i get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. i politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before i got there, and would i do her the favor of just switching?

here's the thing: if circumstances were different, i would have! but i explained that i had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that i could sleep. i really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts right then and there. 

by this point the plane is filling up, i'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so i just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. the mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. the flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as i did) goes, ""this is an exit row. your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. there's not going to *be* another empty row. please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

so i sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and i figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, i push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. when we land, i'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""you look like you slept well, bitch.""

so, reddit. am i the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**edited to add:** okay, thanks reddit, i think most of you agree that i'm not the asshole here. but please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. the kids were just fine. they watched something on their ipad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",3
"when i read my mom's recipes. throwaway because there's just no way i'm immortalizing this shit on my actual reddit account. 

this morning my mom messaged me to ask if i could come over and update the antivirus software on her pc. i agreed to drop in when i'm done working.

fast forward to me appearing in front of my mom's computer, initiating the update process, and proceeding to do nothing but stare at the progress bar. while i was doing that, my mom proceeded to prepare dinner. 

the update was taking forever so i decided to kill time by bringing necessary order to my mom's desktop. it was a mess. dozens of random folders scattered across the screen in no particular order whatsoever. i couldn't even see the fucking wallpaper. it was enough to summon the ocdemon buried inside of me and clean up the clutter. 

so, as i was organizing my mom's shit, i noticed a folder called ""mom's recipes"". now, as a guy who's dating a girl who loves a man who can cook, this folder peaked my interest. i figured it wouldn't hurt skimming over some of my mom's recipes and perhaps surprising the girlfriend with an unexpected home cooked meal.

i opened the recipe folder and clicked on the word document inside. now, i'll be honest, i'm not the world's most intelligent person, but when i see the words ""mom"" and ""recipes"", i imagine wholesome family dinners and shit. not...

""i'm a woman, i'm a widow, i'm a mother, i'm over 50, and i'm still the whore next door""

this was the fucking opening line to my mom's so called ""recipes"". it was an ominous sign that i should not read any fucking further. i read further. it became clear to me my mom's recipes had nothing to do with how to cook, but rather how to fuck. i made it through the first two pages before the ""recipe book"" went into graphic detail about what my mom's preferences were when it comes to size of the dick going into her mouth and vagina versus the size of the dick going into her ass. 

i closed the document, finished the update, and got the fuck away from that computer. my mom invited me stay for dinner but i declined. all i could see was different sized dicks entering my mother everywhere. i think i need to end our relationship now. 

tl;dr read my mom's recipes and realized her favorite ingredient is cock.",4

"for being a ""karen"" about my car being ""fixed""?. my car was shaking when i braked from high speeds, my dad told me it was the rotors and i believed him but the deal i got the car from has free diagnostic so i took it there. 

so my dad was right, it was the rotors. my friend had just done the brake pads like a month ago but not the rotors. so the dealer guy said it'll be 650 to get all four rotors shaved down and an oil change (synthetic oil so oil change is like 90 bucks itself). i said ok. 

he calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. i asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. i specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

he calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so i needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. i said i told you not to cut those and he was like ""i was just tryna to help you out""


i'm fuming at this point, go to pick up my car. it's 750 for the two front rotors and the oil change (when they had quoted me 850 for all 4 and the oil change?!). i pay and leave. my car is literally not drivable  it's so shaky. i bring it back and tell him the car is dangerous at this point and it needs to be fixed. we get into and he's like i'll do the back rotors for free labor but it's 200 for the rotors. i tell him i'll get a lawyer cause i'm not giving him literally another penny, i paid 750 for a car that's worse than before. 


i ask for the manager and eventually they agree that it was their fuck up and they'll eat the back rotors. pick the car up the next day and it's good. 


i told my parents and they said they're proud of me but my one friend said i was a ""karen""

she finds it funny. extremely funny. so funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. after a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. i asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, i start to reach for my phone.

turns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. whoops.

when i was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. she thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. this led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. it turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

"update:for objecting to 'girls day'?. hello,

this is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

this last month has been kind of wild for me so i haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. so the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. due to the fact that i had deactivated my facebook and was only receiving text messages, i didn't realize what was happening before i was ambushed by it. my sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and i confirmed that it was. and she insisted i was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. i responded that i in no way did that as i was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

this spread to my family and now the thread was shared on facebook and everyone was shown. i was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where i was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what i did was wrong and demanded an apology. they said that 'i knew' they weren't excluding me and because i gave everyone that impression i owed them an apology. i replied that i absolutely did not know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. i replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-op event, not a girls only event.  they explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether i was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because i'm not a girl. at this point we were going around in circles so i just explained my perspective, i said that i'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it i feel excluded. i explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation i was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

at the end of this family meeting, i was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and i was accused of many things that i didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. i told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that i was going no contact for a while. i told them i'm an adult, and i have my own life, and the reason i wanted to be involved was because i didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. if that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but i told them that i was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. my mother/sisters told me that if i was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. at this point, my relationship with my family is over, i left that family meeting and have not reactivated facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. que sera, sera.

i figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. this all happened a few days ago. 

the day i made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. well, that didn't turn out well. 

before i told her about my background, i asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards jews. she pretty much sounded like hans landa the whole time. at one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a jewish student. 

afterwards i bluntly told her that i'm jewish. she didn't believe me at all and thought i was joking. i told her that i was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. this went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

when it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. things went 0-100 very fast. she got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. she said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. when she insulted me i reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. she cried hysterically and i left. 

the next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that she dumped me and not the other way around.  she warned me not tell people that i dumped her since that would make her look bad. i didn't say anything and closed the door. i heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare i close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". after a while she left and started writing me on snapchat. i blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. i've never seen her act so crazy. 

long story short, i blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. i knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but i didn't know it would be this bad. some of her stuff is still at my place. oh well

"by hoarding my grandparents' pension and starving them.. my grandparents don't earn much and are living hand to mouth. they don't go out much from their house. so i help them in their routine chores like paying bills, going to atms etc.  i'm also incharge of collecting their pension. 

few days back, my granddad gave me the undertaking required to collect the pension. it usually takes an hour but that day it took 3. i also had somethings to attend to. so, when i was done, i realised that it was late. i came back to my place (we live separately) and figured that i'll return his pension the next day. 

the next few days were so hectic that i completely forgot about his pension. i usually keep two wallets, one has all the cash (which i keep at home and has the pension) and the other one has only cards. i use the latter one more. after 5 days, i was in need of some cash. so i opened my other wallet and realized that his pension was still sitting there. 

i was horrified and then some guilt came and then a little more. i was so ashamed that i ran to their house. i knew that they'd be angry so i bought some groceries as a compensation. as soon as my granddad opened the door,  i started apologizing. he kept smiling during my apology and forgave me as soon as i was done. i handed over the pension and went to keep the groceries in the fridge.

well my guilt was gone and i was again my normal miserable self. i opened the fridge to put the groceries in, and it was literally empty except a few ice trays there was nothing. my guilt came running back to me, i walked in the kitchen and there was just a half cut loaf of bread. i knew i was the cause of this. 

i asked them about it and they told me how they knew i was busy and thought that i'd turn up when i have the time. they didn't even try calling me because of the same reason. i had never been more ashamed in my life.  my one mistake pushed them towards starvation. 

they already had a really hard life. they had been abandoned by their children, who took all their money. first their children stopped caring then somewhere down the line, they did too. and i guess that's why they've stopped asking for anything from anyone. it's really hard to watch and still, they keep smiling with their saddened eyes. i guess when you get old, you stop expecting from life anymore. 

tl;dr: forgot to give my grandpa's pension back due to my busy schedule. they didn't have enough money to buy groceries and had to survive on a loaf of bread.

"by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that i had to be rescued. then i did something really embarrassing.. 


a few years ago i spent a saturday blissfully tripping by myself. i had dosed that afternoon and i started coming down as the sun was coming up. it was a bright, crisp morning and i felt completely at peace. i was shuffling my music and sunday morning by the velvet underground came on. it was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

i suddenly made a decision. i had to make some changes. i had to get my fat ass to the gym.

i was surprised to see so many people. i had thought, hey, 7am on a sunday, i'll have the run of the place. i was obviously incorrect. all the cardio machines were taken. i couldn't just stand there. i was already getting sweaty and i'd been so high for so long so recently.

i saw an empty bench press and went for it. i couldn't remember what i used to bench back in school so i decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. i am 6'2 and 250 lbs. i was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

it was heavier than i imagined. i figured my guns were rusty. i decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. it was all i could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. i let it sit on my chest while i came up with a plan. every time i tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. i decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. with momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. perfect. i tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

the bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. i lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. if anyone heard it, they ignored it. despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. it hurt. i slowed my breathing and just relaxed. it'll be ok, i thought. i got this, i prayed.

*brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

nope, it's bad, this is bad. everyone had to have heard the rounds i let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. the volume was incredible. no one knew i was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. no one laughed. time was frozen but i assume only a few minutes passed. finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. he looked up at me with genuine concern.

""hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............whhhoooooooot.*

to his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. more like a twitch. i nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. i tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. he left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. all i wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. like i wasn't bothered at all.

so, knowing i was being observed, i did this. i stood tall, nodded to myself like i nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *alright*

**fuck.**

**me.**

the door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. i ran to my car.

i can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. there is nothing funny about the clap. it pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp. i just wanted to look like a normal human being.

tl;dr i went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak i am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until i was rescued. then i pretended i had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *alright* as if i could alter reality by sheer force of will.",4

obviously this is super illegal (thanks, la!), and i call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

i started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after i threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and i call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what i was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

so yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because i subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  my attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  everybody wins?  

except i still gotta die, yo.  after i move lol.  at least i can afford it i guess.  :( 

thanks la.   ",2
"update nc sold them a used car, now they sued me.. a lot of stress was lifted from our shoulders today, thankfully. 

original post here(https://amp.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b2mi6a/nc_sold_them_a_used_car_now_they_sued_me_over_it/)

this morning we had our court date, and let me tell you it was pretty quick. got in at 8:32, out by 8:50. the plaintiff presented her case, in which she said that we hadn't disclosed an airbag light that was on the dash, and that the check engine light code we told them about was false information because it actually turned out to be another issue. said the vehicle had more rust than they originally knew about, and that they hadn't driven it because a mechanic told them it was unsafe to drive. 

we presented our defense, clearly stating they had the opportunity to have the vehicle checked by a mechanic, but chose to take our word for it; and that we brought all known faults to their attention prior to selling them the vehicle. anything they found after they took ownership wasn't our issue anymore, they had all chances to make a proper decision prior. we brought up the ftc's private sale guide stating that all cars sold from private party to private party are ""as-is"" unless otherwise stated. we neither expressed nor implied any warranties. 

long story short, the magistrate dismissed the case with prejudice to the plaintiff  because nc is a ""buyer beware state"" and the buyer should have done all in their power to make an informed decision before purchasing the vehicle. they have 10 days to appeal, but i doubt that's gonna happen. 

thanks to everyone that commented and gave my wife and i more information on the original post. it sure helped!

tl;dr: magistrate heard the case, dismissed it because the buyer should have done more to inspect the vehicle.

what is the scariest thing you've ever seen while driving at night?. ,1
"i got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. after 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. i need help on how to handle this.. 
i am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

at 16 i slep with my good friend jared . the condom broke and my daughter was created. my parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. i couldn't bring it over myself to. i wanted to keep the baby. ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. so i did. i went to my friends house and his parents took me in. they weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

in that time my friend and i started to develop feelings for each other.

i had my daughter and about 2 moths later jared's  brother  came back into their life's. he was a recovering heroin addict. as we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. my parents got wind of that. they dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my mil also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

so they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. it was a dark time i thought they were going to take my baby. in the end they didn't find anything substantial.

but them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. as it was a small town every mistake i made got back to my parents.

i was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? cps charges because neglect.
i was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . cps.

christmas loads of people stayed at jared's house because it was a big family. cps because many strange men were there.

they eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. if they had done it more i think it could have been an offence.

the last call was 5 years ago.

eventually jared and i married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. we worked retail jobs and studied. it took us longer than average to graduate but we did. with a lot of help of his parents. jared is now an engineer and i work as a graphic designer.

we were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. our life's look normal now.

anyway a week ago i get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

i don't really know what to do. because while they didn't have to take care of my while i was pregnant i wished they had at least supported me. and while i get that they were panicking because they thought i was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",8
"(update) i want to ask my (m34) business partner (f31) to be with me romantically. how do i go about changing the context of our relationship?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjn6u0/i_want_to_ask_my_m34_business_partner_f31_to_be/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) 

short update because i'm supposed to be working. and i don't expect this to get attention because my original post didn't but i don't know who else to tell. 

the day after i posted originally, i told her i'm in love with her, and asked her on a ""real date"". it went well. really well, so easily and just good. and she slept next to me again that night.. i got to kiss her in public! she said it felt like our little family was right, and it really does, it feels like everything just sort of snapped into focus.

i am going to take everyone's advice and not just spring a marriage proposal on her out of nowhere, but i want to marry this girl and have more babies with her. because everything just makes sense now. 

and yes, she said she loves me too!!!!!!

"if you can't feed'em don't breed'em.. its not responsible tax payers job to pay for your children. if you can't afford kids don't have them. paying people more money per month for every child they have and can't support is a stupid policy that incentivizes people to keep having kids. if you've already got two you can't afford... stop fucking having kids. 

make birth control mandatory for those who receive government assistance. grandfather those who are already on assistance. no kids starve and no new kids are born to parents who cannot support them. 

edit: i'm not an expert but when i was in high school in 2006 living in flint michigan i had access to free birth control and unlimited condoms at the city health clinic. 

double edit: for those wondering my stance on abortion.

if you can't support'em ... abort'em.

sending food to countries that can't feed themselves only makes the problem worse. the root of the problem is these people can't feed themselves. feeding them only allows them to keep reproducing, creating even more mouths that can't be fed. either teach these people to farm or let them starve. if they aren't capable of farming, survival of the fittest. 

parts of africa are like the crazy cat lady. she sees a few starving cats and thinks this is horrible, so she feeds them. pretty soon they reproduce and she has even more cats to feed. what started out as a few starving cats turns into 50 starving cats. she hasn't solved a problem she just made it worse. she had good intentions but didn't stop cats from starving, she just created more starving cats.

"make the habit of using questions instead of judgement on scenarios where you're trying to express your opinion. i've been using this tip particularly with my family in the regular basis. i no longer tell my wife ""you look like you didn't sleep right"", instead i ask ""how did you sleep?"" or to my daughters, instead of ""you broke this toy"" i would say ""what happened to the toy?"" and let them explain. this has helped me be seem as more understanding, less accusatory and gives others the opportunity to rationalize and explain the situation. this also helps them vent and respect me more for not jumping into conclusions, but ultimately this helps avoid conflict.

"wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. i literally do not know what to do. this is long, **tl;dr** at bottom.

my wife and i have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  she's always been one of the most amazing people i've ever met. no huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. that's why this is so difficult for me.

we've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  she's in marketing and i work independently as an it consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  we decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  we've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

long story short, i was diagnosed with azoospermia last december.  blockage in the pipes just meant i wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. it's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this july.  she's got a high sex drive as do i, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way i could have gotten her pregnant.

she missed her period this week.  i couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  the babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  she took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

at first i was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. she's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. i'm not the jealous type, but i'm literally stuck.  the doctors said this couldn't happen.  and i can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

my wife's been ecstatic. she's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. she was so excited when she first found out that i didn't express my worries then.  but she left for work and now i feel completely torn.  what if she did cheat?

looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. she definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. she always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  i remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

fuck man i don't know what to do.  i set up an appointment on monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  if it is mine and i accuse her of cheating i feel like the world's biggest asshole. but she's coming home in a few hours and i don't know what i'm going to say to her, i can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and i just didn't see it.

do i wait until the doctor appointment monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? i'm worried i won't be able to hide what's going on.

**tl;dr:  wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july.  wife got pregnant anyways.  it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.  want to wait until monday, but don't think i can hide it.  what do i tell her?**

**edit:**  i should add i've been cheated on before.  our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  i'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**edit** i really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  my wife's coming home though in an hour and i have to decide if i'm going to put on a happy face until monday or not.

**edit** she texted saying she's going be home late

this is bringing up some old emotional scars i think and is just fucking with me.  i'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  i think i need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

"my (f 20) mother (f 37) tells me if i don't be her surrogate she'll cut me out of her life forever.. my mother and her new husband want to have a baby. she's still young so she still is fertile however both of her past pregnancies were complicated and very dangerous. so her doctor told her to absolutely not get pregnant as it will just be even more risky now that she's older. she told me all of this this morning, and then she asked me to be her surrogate. she said all i have do is carry her egg and have it fertilized by her husband. i told her i can't do that. for one, i'm trying to get my nursing degree and i don't want anything to slow me down. and i already have a two year old with my boyfriend, and remembering what it was like to be pregnant there's no way i want to go through it again so soon. i'm also worried because a lot of the bonding mothers do with their babies is while it's still in the womb. i don't want to feel attached maternally to a baby that won't be mine. i gave her my reasons and she just rolled her eyes and told me ""it would be a small sacrifice for you to do this for me"". she told me all she wants is another baby and that i shouldn't deprive her of it when i can help her so easily. i tried to reason with her but she literally told me ""if you don't do this to me then i don't want a relationship with you anymore"". i asked her if she was serious and she told me ""yes"" and left. i don't know what to do. my mom is very stubborn and very vindictive so she probably means it at least for now. i'm not sure how i should handle this. i think she's acting crazy.",8
"for going off on a lady for calling the cops on me? wib if i reported her?. i'm black. my husband is white. he has a sister, who has a 3-year-old daughter who loves me, and who i think isn't too bad herself. my niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. we hang out a lot to give my sil a break, and my husband doesn't really ""get kids"" so it's often 1x1. 

i was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. she was defiant, and i'm all about consequences after two warnings. she kept running from me laughing her butt off, so i told her it was time to go. normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a gigantic fit so i had to carry her. she wasn't screaming in a ""who is this help me"" way but in a clearly understandable ""no, i want to stay and play. auntie(me), no"" way. but also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. 

as we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. i smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. she then got in my face like ""do you know this child."" i'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so i just said yes and tried to step around her. she then said, ""you're not leaving until you prove you know that child."" i told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, ""no mother would ever say that about her kid"". yeah, maybe. but she can't spell so. she then demanded i give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity. 

i was pissed. i told her i don't have to prove anything to her and i'm leaving with my kid. she then literally ran  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. cops called. security guy asks what's up. i was polite to him but i told the lady off. i said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to immediately jump to kidnapping was insane. the cops showed, and they asked my niece who i am ""auntie (me)!"" and i showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. it's done. 

she  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. i want to report it. she'd been watching us and saw my niece and i hanging for at least 30 minutes familiarly. so while i could have showed her the pictures, i didn't feel like i needed to. it's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. now, i have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. i'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. i just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the ""this isn't my mom"" card. and then i really would need the cops to be called because i'd kill her. 

i get she was concerned. and that unlikely i'd adopted a white baby. but also, 100% fuck off, lady. aita? would i be if i complained to the facility?",3

if there is anyone in your life, at any capacity, who straight up acts as they don't care about you, you should take their actions at face value.

"by stumbling on my 19 y/o sons reddit and reading through it.. dear lord. on my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so i clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  i click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

this is my sons account. it has to be. the comment he posted is about something that happened while i was there. he had a more detailed post about that specific day. he had another previous post about an event in his life i knew about and knew some details about. he had a few other posts which i also read. 

i now know what gets him going sexually. not something i needed to know.

i know what his girlfriend likes sexually. also, not something i needed to know. also quite surprising. 

i know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. i feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

i know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife's room.

in reading through the comments he's made to others, i've learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. i feel very proud about that.

overall, i wish i never clicked that first comment. i know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

tl;dr. accidentally discovered my son on reddit. found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, i shouldn't have read all of it. and some posts i stayed away from. and honestly, i didn't realize it right-right away. the first post i read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. it was after another that i really put the pieces together. and yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. but hey, life isn't always fair. i also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything i read.**",4

"by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but actually close to a year ago. last october to be exact. 

so backstory. i had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. they just didn't want one thing: us having sex before marriage. they had a lot of reasons. and we were actually planning on it. but we both weren't virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. so of course, temptation got the better of us. okay, end of backstory. 

she was a senior in high school and i had just started college about an hour away. we rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. we would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. everytime she would leave i would get sad, but knew i'd see her again. 

one time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. no answer. she said she was gonna text her. made sense to me. once she said we had, we got right to business. she put her phone on the bed, and i didn't even 

things went on for awhile. lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. lots of fun. and by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. followed by some vibrating. it was her phone ringing, but we couldn't find it. then we found it under my ass. we laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. it was her mom. and within seconds, my girlfriend's expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

turns out that she hadn't clicked send on the text she sent out. so her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. and in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone ""daddy"" who was definitely not her dad (the mother's words, not mine).  

she told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
my girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. i attempted to calm her down but she wouldn't. so i drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying ""how could she do this"" and other things along those lines. my girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. her mother absolutely said i was not allowed over. 

so we got back to our hometown, i parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn't get caught. she drove home. i called my mom for a surprise ""i'm home for the weekend"". she came and picked me up, and i bawled in her arms. i told her everything. she comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

we got back to my house, and i laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. i cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. for the longest time, i thought i never would hear from her again. then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. she said she was coming over and we needed to talk. once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. she said her parents were calm now, and then i was gonna be able to come talk. i was nervous, but i loved her so i did it. 

when i got to their house, i walked in and instantly just started apologizing. i went on and on about how ""we won't do it again"" and how ""we're just stupid teenagers"" and most importantly how i was gonna ""rebuild their trust"". eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. we opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

at the end of it all, i learned they just loved their daughter and didn't want her getting hurt. but they trusted me. and we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. and everything is cool. sometimes i worry it's still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. 

tldr: my girlfriend and i took phone sex to a whole other level.

"preheating the oven is a scam ran by the government to take your money. every fucking time i buy a frozen pizza, i put that sassy bitch in right when i start the oven. why? because i've figured it out. that's right uncle sam, i'm onto you. 

the directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425f and cook for 15 minutes. my oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. so, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? no way. not chance in hell, buckaroo. when i shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, i add 3-4 minutes to compensate. this means i wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. and guess what? it tastes fucking delicious. ask any of my friends. i cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can't get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. the pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. source: i've been doing this for 12 years.

so nice try, mr. president. i know you want all of us to cook our pizzas for that extra 10 minutes to make us use a little extra electricity. maybe it isn't significant if one person cooks their frozen italian love pie for 10 extra minutes, but you're a thinker. you're looking at the grand  scheme of things. millions of people cooking their pizza for 10 minutes extra? that's straight theft, my man. and i ain't giving in to that scheme .",6

edit: wow. i think making this post was one of the single most worst decisions of my life. my gf uses reddit and by sheer coincidence found this post, thought ""haha this reminds me of me and joycemanner!"", saw my username, made the connection, and broke up with me. all within 20 minutes of making this post! she thought there was underlying issues in our relationship and me being a cheap asshole was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

edit2: to answer some repeated questions: i made this as a throwaway account. the account name is based off a pretty popular band (joyce manor) i like so, i didn't think she would realize it was me. i'm 26 and she's 20. her name is not joyce. i don't think she'll come on here to give her side of the story.

"for telling cashier that wasn't the girls credit card?. 
throwaway because husband told me i was ta and want to know before i get home and argue. on phone format is bad.

i was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. one of the girls had picked out a pair of very expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she's really gonna spend that much on boots. girl with boots says something along the lines of ""it's fine i have my dads credit card i'm not paying "" which instantly caught my attention because thats not her card. i've told my son multiple times he's never allowed to use my card so i'm interested to see how this girl thinks she's going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

we end up at the same register (me behind) and i see her total hit well over four digits. the girl is about to swipe her card when i decide that i can't let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. i tell cashier that isn't her card but her father's and i'm not sure she has permission. girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look i've ever seen. i swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, i don't think she was ever told no.

girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it's the stores credit card and it gives him the points. now that i've pointed out it wasn't hers cashier tells her she can't use that card. girl tries to show id to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and i tell her it's still fraud. girl says it's not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. i tell her that it is my business that she's doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or i call the cops. girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. she uses her own card and leaves crying. cashier looks mad at me and i tell my husband when i get home only for him to agree i was in the wrong.

"today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from. the mystery fence(https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nqdq)

delaware, usa. no homeowners association.

we live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. it's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. there was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). i removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

well i come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. the leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

i don't know who owns it, so i called the real estate agent. he was just as shocked as i was when i told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. he had no idea. he'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. i asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. she didn't.

what do i do about this fence?",2
"for pretending to be an ""appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?. i got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

i told them them all that i had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. when i first told them they thought i was joking, but they underestimated how committed i would be to a joke. so, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) i was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

finally after about a week they bought that i had become an appletarian. they started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. some of them even got angry.

but i wanted to stick with the joke. finally, after the end of 3 weeks, i walked into what i was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

they were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. finally i started laughing hysterically. they were confused as hell so i told them i had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. i even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

i thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. my girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago i had ruined our date night when i told the waiter i only wanted apples because i was an appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

in my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

but, did i go too far?

"still my favorite joke i ever made up. :). a monocle walks into a bar. after a few drinks he starts to feel pretty good (and a little uncoordinated). he reaches for a cigarette, but the bartender stops him. ""sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. you'll have to step outside to smoke.""

so the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. they bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. they try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

the bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. ""hey you two!"" he shouts. ""stop making spectacles of yourselves!""",0
"me (m34) and fiancee (f27), i am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an ""open"" relationship.. alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as i'm doing it. as it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. i'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (i only found  out because one of her friend's bf contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). i confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. i'll be totally honest in saying that i'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. i manned up, moved on and proposed (which i had planned on doing anyway). this is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200b;

fast forward to recent time. we are due married in november (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. distant, not herself, away with the fairies. even stopped having sex, which was very strange. i put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. forward to christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. i confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. i was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200b;

however, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. i arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. the vibe was bad guys, i could tell. we sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. at this rate i was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. basically, a few of her friends had back in october (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. i'll be honest, the idea made me ill. i said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........i got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. i wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. we got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. i basically said that i needed some headspace, and that i'd spend the weekend at my mates. it was quick after that, and i left without a fuss. i'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. i am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. i suppose if anyone has been in a similar place i could do with some advice

"an agrument is when you are trying to determine who is right, a conversation is when you are trying to determine what is right.. in the business world we should all be having conversations, however in my experience this is very rarely the case, mostly it is arguments. so how do you change this? the first step is to point out the above. ultimately this entire situation is caused by the ego, a universal variable most managers never take into account. try to separate yourself from your idea and present it in a way that is purely beneficial to the company, if you do this enough times your ego will eventually be rewarded.

"posting an update to my story using the throwaway format about my sil(14f) accusing me(26m) of impregnating her.. since this is basically over now i'm posting an update on what all happened. the old post was deleted for not using the throw away format so a quick summary. leaving out a lot due to this being mobile and way to much shit went on to cover here.

my sil who is 14 got pregnant and when her parents found out she lied and told them that i was the father.  my wife left to be with her family when this broke and her father was in a rage.  i got a lawyer.

the lawyer i got told me i needed to pack up take of work and stay somewhere we're my wife and her family wouldn't know where to find me.  boy was he right.  the next day our apartment was broken into by my fil and completely trashed with a baseball bat.  my neighbors called the police obviously and he ended up getting arrested but bailed out by my mil the next day.

my wife's entire family constantly texting and calling to say how horrible of a person i was.  my lawyer met with the family and their lawyer to tell them i denied all the accusations and that i wanted a dna test done.  after the meeting the texts and calls switched to calling me a coward for accusing my sil of lying.

this went on for a few more days before the mounting pressure finally broke my sil's resolve.  she came clean  and told everyone who the real father was, being a 15 year old at her school that told her to make something up.

when this news came out i still had to go through some whole bs investigation to show that i wasn't actually a secret child predator.  

i'm self employed so we will see how bad this whole episode is going to screw up my life and i'm definitely pressing charges against my fil for the damage he did to my apartment and threat to my life he posed.  

contrary to what most people on here suggested i do i am not going to immediately divorce my wife.  our marriage was amazing before this happened and i don't want to throw that away over a stupid 14 year old and her boyfriend.  i've seen my wife a few times and told her i understand why she did what she did and that i still want to be with her given that i will not want to be around specifically her father or her sister for a long time and that before we move in together again we get marriage counseling.  she agreed to those terms and we have been to a few sessions separately and together now.  

thanks for the input i got on the old post.

edit:  lot of people are acting like this whole situation continued even with dna evidence proving i was innocent, that's not the case.  there never was a dna test and likely won't be now that sil admitted and the actual father confirmed it.  the threat alone of a dna test is what made her tell the truth.

i also said i'm not immediately divorcing my wife, it may come to it after we have tried counseling but i don't know at this time.  yes i'm hurt by my wife not believing me but at the same time we've only been married for a year and a half and she basically raised her sister while her parents worked and has always been very close to her.  

my wife didn't cut contact with me through this i did at the direction of my lawyer.  i left my phone with him and looking back through it now she never accused me of anything was just asking questions trying to figure out what was going on.  

my fil acted out on his own by breaking in no one knew what he was doing and i don't have any sympathy for his actions and am pressing charges for everything he did.  he broke in not used my wife's keys to get in.  the door frame  was completely destroyed.",8

"nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. long time la reader here, and i'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. when i'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

early in november we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend i'll call aaron (because his name's aaron and i think he's being an idiot) had bought on ebay. we had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

it'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. i'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. there was no way i'd go through the water as it looked, but because i'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river i didn't want to risk it. i didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. i said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

aaron decided to push on and started moving and i panicked and got straight out. it was far more water than i'd had to go through when i near lost my car and life before. i got out well before the water though so i didn't let water in the car btw.

aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. he was extremely lucky not to drown, and i ran down & helped him out. immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. admittedly i'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of ebay parts in the back so it's not like i'd have made much difference.

we phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. we haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. but on friday i received a letter from a lawyer i know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. it's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because i made the car unsafe by getting out. it was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

i think he's being a dickhead. someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? ideally i'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what i think they'll be. i want to contact his lawyer to tell them aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should i get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

"by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life. this is long so tldr at the bottom.

this happened around 6 years ago when i was in 9th grade. i grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. my parents never taught me anything about genitals and i apparently never asked, all i knew was that's where the pee came out.

so one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. i was pretty shocked because that's certainly not how mine worked. by that time i was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

so armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work i went home and a few google searches led me to discover that i had a severe case of phimosis. so being the pragmatic young buck that i am i also google how to fix it. there were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel i opted for the latter option. i got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom's bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

after about 4 hours of stretching i finally started making some progress! i could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell i've ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. it dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. i kept stretching over the course of a few days and i started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as i stretched. some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as dick cheese. 

i cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. that was about to change real fucking fast.

so this was about 10 days into my stretching and i'd gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. i was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so i got very impatient and i decided i'd try to force it all the way back that day i lubed and got to work, i pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. i pulled it till i couldn't bear the pain anymore. i did this over and over again for around 3 hours until i somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. i got way too excited and despite the pain i gave it one big yank and i felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. it hurt like hell but i was just so relieved that i didn't care. i opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. the entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. that was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where i tore the top part of my foreskin when i yanked it over the glans. i freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. it eventually stopped and then i had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. i eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. i was still hurting but i was finally done. i got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. i thought that was it. i tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn't budge so i just left it.i completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. you know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? that's how my penis looked. i went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

when i got home i was still in major pain so i decided i'd check on it. i undressed in the shower and looked down at it. the first thing i saw were the blisters. two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. the next thing i noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. i'm a black guy.

i realized that if i didn't find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. i lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. this was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. i kept trying to force it back over and i put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  my penis was on fire at this point and i was holding back tears but i kept pushing until i felt it pop back over the glans. judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain i felt i guess the second blister popped too. once again i left it and fucking went to bed. 

i checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. i rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks i was pretty much ok. my foreskin was still tight and i do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. even if they aren't as stupid as i was don't take that risk lol

tl;dr; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because i got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn't get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

edit: so i didn't expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

so while i'm happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, i'd like to clear up something. this post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  rather, i'd like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

for those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. don't be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. they have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. for those of you who aren't old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. believe me it's not as awkward that you think. don't risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like.

"i (m28) broke up with my ex-fiancee (f27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. i am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.. hey guys,

i need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

a little background: 

me and my ex-fiancee had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. i was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. she was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

back in april of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. i once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

it all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in june because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. that was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. i didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. i fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. it made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

everything was kinda ok until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. the picture was of my ex-fiancee at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. i fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. she was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

when i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

she cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. i was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

i told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. she begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

i did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancee had comitted suicide. her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

i am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancee friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

i am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",8
"for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?. throwaway for obvious reasons. basically i m42 got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. i got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""andy, sara, kate"". i had these tattoos all done at once after kate was born knowing she would be my last. my oldest child andyt22 came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. my wifef41 immediately supported her and made sure that i would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. it was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. i'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to athena. 

the problem arose yesterday when my wife and athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. the tattoo going down my arm still reads ""andy"" and not ""athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. my wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but i explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""andy"" to ""athena"". i told her i would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which i can not afford either of. i explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that i don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if i don't support who she is, i just need to leave her life. my wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if i don't ""get my act together"". i personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

so im basically wondering if im the asshole in this situation.",3

"update iowa city threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors. this is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

hello r/legaladvice,

a few months ago i posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town i live in sent a letter demanding that i take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. most of the comments i received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my first amendment rights, and yes, i should seek a lawyer. 

so i did so. i set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. however, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended i speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

skipping over unnecessary details, i met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. i updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

once i updated the website and the city realized i wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. i went, although now i realize i probably should not have done so. he was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought i should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. he also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think i should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. i declined the interview, because i was afraid i'd get sued (whether justified or not) if i said something the city didn't like.

of course, i was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. so she ran her story, and i was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. what's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. they were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

a few weeks later i received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. it was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. he told me i was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. the letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

this was around mid-january, 2018 (i received the first letter mid-december, 2017). everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until i got an email from the legal director at the aclu of iowa. on the advice of reddit, i had emailed both the aclu and the eff, but after over a month with no response i had figured they were too busy to look at my case. i was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

i spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the aclu of iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. toward the end of february we filed suit in federal court, and by march 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. they had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content i produce regarding the town.
2. they must pay legal damages to me.
3. they must pay attorney fees to the aclu.
4. they must write an apology letter to me.
5. my favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take first amendment training.

all in all, i'm incredibly impressed with the aclu's work on this case. i know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but i think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. i'm super grateful to the aclu for helping me with this, because as i said above, i wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. i'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the aclu -- thank you for all of the help!",2
"fiance has dropbox folder of all nudes and of sexually explicit acts from all of his past exes and hookups—including coworkers who doesn't know he has them and women he's said he's never been with.. me: 30f
fiance: 38m

we've been together for 5+ years and engaged for just the past few months. throughout the course of our relationship, a few women would constantly reach out to him. when i asked about them, he told me that they were just friends and that nothing had happened between them. 

this past week, i was playing a game we play together on his ipad when a questionable text came in. i went into the text messages and found out that he had been lying about talking to and grabbing lunches with one of his current friends from work. being really angry and insecure about it i then went through his phone. we have access to each other's phones to play each other's dumb games when one of us isn't felling well but i have always respected his privacy up until this point.

what i discovered was a dropbox folder with a bunch of folders with women's initials. in each folder was pictures of nudes his ex's and hookups had sent him, pictures of him or her performing sexual acts on each other, and pictures of me that were taken while i was so black out drunk i couldn't remember them being taken. 

several of the women in the photos were women he swore up and down to me were just childhood friends/coworkers and that i had nothing to worry about even though he had daily conversations with one and the other would text him heart and i love you's. 

after some discussion he admitted that some of the pictures he had taken off of his coworkers computer without their consent. he is an it professional with access to all of his coworkers computers. 

i checked through time stamps and i don't believe any of this was sent during the duration of our relationship together. i am still very upset that he lied about his relationship level with several people and the pictures he had of me and that he violated his coworker's privacy as well.  he insists he has never gone back to this folder while we were together. i feel like i'd be very disturbed if i were one of these women and knew that he still had these photos. 

regarding the original girl, he just didn't want to tell me because he thought i'd be mad. i am much madder that he lied than that he has a female friend that he gets lunch with.  after we hashed this out, i asked him if there was anything else he was lying about or hiding from me or if there's anything else i should know and i wouldn't get mad. he lied. two days later i found this personal ""porn"" stash. 

i am so shocked and have no idea what to make of this situation. am i making a bigger deal out of this than it really is? is this grounds for ending the engagement? the relationship as a whole? part of me wants to tell these other women what he did but at the same time i just forced him to delete the whole folder permanently so it couldn't be restored. 

he claims that he had a sex addictions the time that he was still working through as we started dating which i'm sure i can believe but i don't have any experience with this but i'm just so overwhelmed and caught off guard that i don't know how to make a rational decision right now.

edit: first i want to thank everyone reaching out. this relationship has been very hard for me since the beginning but i was always made to feel like my feelings were crazy and that he was doing nothing wrong. i can't help but doubt myself even though i know in my heart that this just isn't right. i'm shocked, upset, disturbed, disgusted, and so many things right now. i feel like i can't even turn to my own friends and family because i'm embarrassed, as has been the case since pretty much day 1. i probably should have left a long time ago but for some reason i always felt like i was to blame. what's going on is beyond not ok and i am now figuring out what my next steps will be. thank you again for all of the support.

edit #2: regarding the ""secret porn stash,"" it wasn't porn from the internet. i was referring to his collection of photos from women from previous relationships. i was always ok with him watching porn and we both did it together. i was disturbed that he kept the photos of exes though. it was also from more people than he had admitted to being with which was another lie unearthed.",8

how do you feel about a 4 day work week?. ,1
"tifu by not understanding that 3.5 grams can be a fuckload. this actually did happen within the last 24 hours, i'm still lying in bed trying to recover. 

so, weed has been legalized, yay canada! obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. my girlfriend and i had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. but we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.

i figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? i mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. fucking harmless. so i spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of mk ultra and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. which were quite good.

we cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. now, i am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. but, i'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *apparently* you should start with 10 mg. see how that goes. but on friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and i didn't feel a damn thing.

we started with two brownies each. two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. i was fine. so i had another one. an hour later, she could barely walk. i didn't feel it as bad as her. so, i had one more. that's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.

turns out mj is a helluva drug. jesus mother-fucking christ. we spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. oh my lawd, i had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. my mind is blown. i could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this ""big deal"" where my girlfriend and i had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!

we were wrecked. about halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. we just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. my girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. she wanted to call an ambulance. none of this is hyperbole. we're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. the dry mouth might've been the worst part. it was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. 

we threw the rest of the brownies out. the smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.

tldr: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. it waaaaaay too much.

edit: thanks for the gold! and silver! and platinum! kinda worth it...?

edit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. i honestly, sincerely hate the waste. but we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. that would be unforgivably irresponsible. 

edit 3: i *did* do research, i just didn't do enough. we have now learned correct math from the comments. you're **supposed** to dose edibles using the thc percentage. this stuff has been tested at 18%. so, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and i had 168... holy fuck.

edit 4: i used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. every 10 minutes i topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. there wasn't much smell at all. i can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.

**final edit**: some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. for those making **positive** contributions, thank you! we're enjoying them! 
1. they say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *wait longer*! like, a day. it is not worth the risk of having too much.
2. there's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.
3. there's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. i fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. so keep that in mind. ",4
"for sending an explicit video my ex sent to me to hurt me to her family. hi aita. i am going to try to make this as brief as possible so i don't ramble.

&#x200b;

i dated em for a year and a half. during this time i confided in her some personal secrets, which i don't feel comfortable sharing even anonymously. because of these she knows that there are certain things, related to sex mostly, that i am very sensitive towards.

&#x200b;

we did not part on friendly terms after our breakup and we don't talk anymore. i broke up with her because i found out she cheated on me, and she flipped out. recently i found out that she is seeing one of my coworkers, and that he is spreading rumors about me that she told him. she basically told him bits and pieces of the personal information i shared with her when we were together and now he's spreading some of that around the office.

&#x200b;

i sent her a message telling her to stop spreading my secrets around and to leave me alone. she replied sending me explicit videos of herself having sex with my coworker because she knew it would hurt me. that was the last straw for me, and i sent the video to all of her family and friends with the message that ""this is what em sends me when i ask her to leave me alone and stop spreading rumors.""

&#x200b;

her familly is quite religious and they lost it. apparently, they pulled their financial support for her college and arent speaking with her atm. aita?

&#x200b;

tl:dr my ex sent me unsolicited sexual videos when i asked her to leave me alone. i sent them to her family. aita?

&#x200b;

edit: well this blew up. i'll try and answer some of the things i have seen asked most often here:

&#x200b;

1: i feel somewhat obligated to clear the air that no, the information being spread was not that i have a small dick, or anything else that was trivial. to put things as general as possible, and to give an idea of how serious the rumors being spread were, i was a victim of csa for a period of several years, and it had a pretty profound impact on my life. it led to me doing some pretty stupid things to cope with it, as well as having a bunch of issues that i struggle with to this day (i never hurt anyone in any way, but there's some shit that i've done that i'd like to not have spread around). she has been picking and choosing the parts from my history that she feels will most hurt me to have spread around, and adding a few stories of her own here and there.

&#x200b;

2: by all of her friends and family, i meant her parents, brother, and a couple of close friends. i worded that terribly. i have not been in the best headspace as of late. sorry.

&#x200b;

3: we have not spoken since. i have no desire to speak to her ever again. my coworker has been on sick leave (apparently) for the past couple days and i have not heard anything from him. as petty and shitty as this sounds, she can die for all i care. i have gone to bed hating myself for ever involving myself with that person ever since she cheated on me. maybe i am an asshole too for my reaction, but she can get bent. i feel no guilt whatsoever for any shit she has to go through because of this.

&#x200b;

4: i will be speaking to my lawyer tomorrow to see what he thinks. i have the money to fight a legal case if i have to, though obviously, i would rather not.

&#x200b;

yeah. that pretty much the main things i wanted to clear up. i'll go through the thread tomorrow if i feel up to it and see if there's anything else. it's a bit of a shitshow and i'm not really emotionally in the right place to read through 1k+ comments atm",3

"for asking for the gift receipt to return offensive baby clothes?. yesterday we had a baby shower. long story short, one of our family friends thought it would be funny to get some baby onesies with offensive things written on them. for example:

* ""i'm with the milf"" 
* ""to-do list: eat, poop, suck some titties"" 

there were like 2 more but i don't remember what they said. when i opened the gift i was humiliated, i thought it was really inappropriate. before people on here give me shit about not being able to take a joke, i just didn't really think this was the funniest ""joke."" i was mad about the gift because as i was opening and before i could read what they said, i unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. some people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda surprised. anyhow, at the end of the party, i asked the person who gave it to me if i could have the gift receipt to return them. i said i definitely wouldn't put my baby in those clothes. the person basically called me oversensitive and said i needed to take a joke. i handed the gift bag back to them and said ""alright, well then you can keep these."" they were super offended by that and thought it was an ungrateful gesture. aita?",3

"for not paying for the meal?. on a road trip last week, my girlfriend and i stopped at a rural diner for brunch. we sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). it was a very nice meal honestly. our total was around $25. i was ready to pay with my debit card.

the waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. unfortunately i had zero cash on me. ""how were we supposed to know?"" i asked. she shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. there was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

she sighs and points to an atm on the other side of the dining room. at this point i'm still apologetic so i went there with my card. i noticed it had a fee of, i shit you not, $9. i asked to speak to the manager. she brought the owner.

i told the owner this is ridiculous. i suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that atm. nope. he threatened to call the police. i said go ahead. my girlfriend felt the same way. long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

i told my sister about this today. she thinks the cops were wrong and i was being an asshole. because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" i think the owner is the asshole. the only part i regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

i have both good news and bad news.

the good news is that i won the battle with my ex. i put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. i had documents about me showing i don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (i don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before i married her. however paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. that ended the case. it took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but i won. i don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. maybe she thought that i won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

the bad news is that, i'm dying. as i mentioned in the comments of my original post, i was battling cancer at the time that i made the post. it was the fourth time in my life that i was dealing with cancer and even though i had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and i have very little chance of beating it again. i will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. i'm happy with the life i've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until i finally rest for good. 

thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. it helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. you could see from my comments on the original post that i was almost ready to give up. ",2
"there needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before i even begin to give a shit about fat acceptance for women.. perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but i'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but i talk to gay men a lot. (i've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

i don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. how emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. my size isn't great either but i've come to accept it, however, i know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

when i see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, i laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. a man can't. a woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. why should i focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

the rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. while it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

edit: as an addendum, i'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

all i can say is fuck most of you. you treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. it was luck of the god damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. while the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. even though i accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) i know i could have it a lot worse and many men do. i still have it in the back of my mind that whoever i'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. i'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**edit 2: i would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

i didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. i'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

firstly i'd like to address this ludicrous notion that i hate women. i dont know how i can prove to any of you that i dont hate women other than me saying i dont. i may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. my problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

i understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. no one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. my main point was i believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **i never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) i simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. i get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. but from where i'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case i apologize and acknowledge my fault. and before anyone addresses it, i'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. that was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and i used penis size as an example. what i really want is inclusivity. of everyone. 

another topic i'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" while i understand the logic, i dont really see how its productive. sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. many of us crave it, strive for it. make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. when a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. if left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. i understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. but i feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. which is why i'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. but i feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. and i agree with that, but all i'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

i obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but i believe i'm a bit of an idealist. for better or worse, i sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. many thought i was an asshole in my post and i would agree with that. i admit i'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why i dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. many suggested that i should start the movement myself, but i'm simply not the right person for the job. i'm hot headed, i sometimes don't think before i speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. i'm a private person, despite how i am online with anonymity, in real life i am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. i also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. i see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" i knew there would be opposition to this post and i was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. perhaps rightly so, because i'm a bit of a dick. but love me or hate me, i stand by most of what i said. 

i sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. supporting one particular group. (culturally speaking i'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) i care about people despite what many of you may believe. and all i really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

the last major point i'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. i'll admit that sure, i wish i had a bigger dick. i feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part i can tolerate it. i've had partners who didn't care and i genuinely believe them. i know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. so you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

one last thing is i really do appreciate the discussion. there are a lot of points i strongly disagree with that i didn't address here, and there are many ideas i really should think over and reevaluate myself. and i thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",6
"update: flneighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent. link to original post in case you need it: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants\_cutting\_down\_my\_magnolia\_trees/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants_cutting_down_my_magnolia_trees/?context=10)

i've received a number of messages begging for an update, but as it's only been a few months, i can only give a partial one, due to the ongoing legal issues (my attorneys have advised me not to divulge too much to anyone).

1) the day after my post, i called a good friend of mine who has been my go to plumber since i inherited the property (we went to high school together), to ask for his help. he went to both houses the next day, saying that i had called him last week since the water bill seemed high, and asked him to come look at the pipes. he went through the houses, surreptitiously taking pictures, while ""inspecting"" the bathrooms/kitchens/water boilers, etc for leaks. apparently while he was there they made a bunch of comments about me that included racial slurs (tldr: i'm biracial, and do not pass for white) and such about how i need to learn my place. after he'd inspected both houses he came over to mine, and gave me all the photos.

2) i conferred with an attorney regarding evicting them, and four days later both families were served with 7 day eviction notices. as expected, they blew up, and started throwing rocks at my house, slinging more racial epithets in my direction. i'd always grown up being terrified of angry racist white men twice my size, i never realized how unbelievably pathetic they actually are until i watched them crying like babies while being hauled off by the police on the video cameras.

3) the bride made a very angry post on facebook, followed up by standing up in church (small town, most of us go to the same church) during ""prayers and concerns"" to beg for prayers for her family because ""our landlord is evicting all of us because she's jealous that i'm getting married!"" the pastor, feigning innocence, said ""i thought she was evicting you all because your father and \groom\'s father cut down \my great-grandmother\'s prize magnolias?"" hardest game of you-laugh-you-lose i've ever played, still proud i survived.

4) according to the arborists (yes plural. though my friend came out and did an assessment, my attorney for the suit over the trees advised selecting someone who isn't so close to me for the paperwork we'll submit to the court), based on the number of trees cut down and the number of trees damaged beyond repair, and how old/well-tended those trees were, the value of the trees alone is more than i could sell all three houses for in the current housing market around here. then the attorney started talking about how the damages are multiplied and let's just say i would be quite happy with half that number, but i know when to zip my lips so i'll let my attorneys handle the negotiating.

5) they did, in fact, destroy the houses as best they could. i have enough savings/inheritance left that i can live without the rents for a while, so i'm using it as an excuse to have both houses renovated since they haven't had major renovations since well before i was born.

6) the bride and groom got married and had their reception in the church basement instead of the cul-de-sac. they had to cancel the honeymoon to spend the money on legal fees. (am i a bad person for being amused?)

7) hurricane michael just gave me some wild thunderstorms, thankfully passed over us with the worst of it.

8) my boyfriend of seven years proposed (finally, goddamn).

&#x200b;

other than that, you'll have to wait until the eternally slow court systems process through. i do want to take a moment to thank you all for thinking of me, and being so helpful with your advice with what was a terrifying ordeal at the time. i'd never really stood up to my elders like that before, and it was comforting to know that not only did a gaggle of internet strangers have my back, but there were resources and protections in my community as well.",2
"found out wife was married before me and never divorced. my wife and i are getting divorced after 19 years of marriage. she moved out 2 weeks ago and is living with her parents. the kids are with me. one of my daughters was at grandma's house this week visiting her mom and grandma mentioned to her this is her second marriage. my daughter mentioned it to me when she got home. i phoned my wife and she told me her high school boyfriend (he was 18, she was 16) took off to mexico and got legally married. when they broke up a year later, they just broke up, never divorced. 
i have called my attorney to get some answers on this, his legal aide said he is out until tuesday. it is killing me. i basically have 2 questions. was i even married? we wed in the u.s., not mexico and divorcing in the u.s. and two, we have a beach house in cabo san lucas. is that now owned by 3 people (her first husband) and will that affect the sale when we try to sell? 

also, no, i did not file for divorce because of this. it was just growing apart. i actually think it is kind of funny as long as it doesn't mess things up.",2
"my husband put his dick in my cup of water, and didn't tell me.. okay, this is not a shitpost. i wish it was. i'm deeply disturbed. 

the other night after sex, as my husband and i were getting up and dressed, i asked if he could grab me a glass of ice water. he was on his way out of the room, and said sure. he wasn't mad about it, and sex was fine. we weren't fighting and had been having a pretty good week. 

as i walk into the kitchen he hands me the glass of water. 

i don't know what came over me, but i got this sixth sense, i don't know how else to describe it. maybe it was his shiteating grin, but i flat out asked him, did you put your dick in this?

he looked shocked and taken aback by my question and for a split second i thought maybe i was being an idiot. 

he then says, how did you know?!?!

i was furious but it was such a strange situation so i just dumped it out and brushed it off. i didn't know what else to do. 

the next day i asked him about it, and i asked why he did it. he said, i don't know.  

i told him that it kind of made me upset, like i can't trust him to get me a glass of water. it hurt my feelings. he immediately got defensive. 

we got into a fight about trust and he didn't understand what the big deal was. i said, so what? do you put my toothbrush in the toilet when we fight??

he said no of course not, but he had that same shiteating grin. 

i don't know if he'd ever do that, and maybe it was just the way i phrased it or that the fight was about him putting his dick in my glass of water. but, like wtf?

i don't know what to think. 

am i overreacting?

edit:

for those asking, we've been married almost 10 years now. he's 34, i'm 32. 

honestly i didn't expect for this to blow up. i wrote a quick post and went to bed.

thank you to everyone responding/giving advice and input, i'm trying to respond to as much as i can. 

here's my takeaway: 

some people, mostly men, are saying it was just a practical joke or a prank.

but here's the thing, he didn't mean for me to find out. i asked him straight up and he told that he wasn't going to say anything. no harm done! that he thought it was funny and that he didn't know why he did it. he just did. 

so to me, it wasn't done in a joking manner. 

after thinking about it, it's more of a consent issue. to those asking, sure we just had sex and yes i suck his dick sometimes...but this is different. he violated boundaries and i feel upset about that.

update:

whether we can all agree to disagree about it being a joke or not, it was disgusting, disrespectful and crossed a line.

i'm going to talk to him later about boundaries and what not.",8

&#x200b;

i went and talked to him this morning i told him that his father is not going to look at me and he needs to respect that. he was adamant that it needs to happen and accused me about lying about my virginity. i was trying to be calm and rational but he was not having it and just became more and more angry. i told him if he really loved me he would stand by me on this and tell his father no to which he slapped me and said he didnt need to prove anything.

so i ended it and left him. i am currently back at my friends house being miserable and eating pizza which is pretty fun. 

so yup. thanks everyone :)",8

"alabama tailgated by police for 3 minutes, then searched and ticketed for going 56 in 55.   

i'm driving down a country road with a posted 55 speed limit. cop car gets in behind me. bad experiences with cops so i do everything by the books, change to the right lane and use autopilot to maintain the exact speed limit, letting the cop pass.

cop changes to my lane and starts tailgating instead of passing. i maintain speed limit. after several minutes, the lights and sirens go on and i get pulled over. they search my car and repeatedly make me do several sobriety tests. i ask to blow into a breathalyzer to prove that i don't drink or do drugs but they didn't have one and kept making me do sobriety tests for around 10-20 minutes while searching my car.

they didn't find anything after wasting my time for half an hour, then gave me a traffic ticket for going 56 mph on a 55 mph road.

not sure if this is legally relevant, but i'm a black male in my 20s with no criminal or traffic violation record. i also had an lsu sticker on the back of my car.

is there anything i can do regarding this, or do i just chalk it up as part of the alabama experience and just fly next time i need to pass through the state? i have a frontal dash cam which did not catch the tailgating behavior but can prove my speed.",2
"my wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! i'm growing very worried. posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

title says it all. we've been married for 3 years now. she's always been one for quirky, ""against-the-grain"" thinking and interests. however, it's not just harmless things like believing there's no gold in ft.knox, taking pictures of trash in ""aesthetic poses"", or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... no, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. but now there's this anti-vax bullshit. 

she got sucked into one of those anti-vax facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she's worked at a fucking wawa for 10 years. she messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on facebook. 

i love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her vitamin k shot, and the hep-b vaccine. however, now she's refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

i know that in her mind, she's coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we've had a number of arguments already. all her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

""oh well if you look this graph you'll see that the numbers of cases for <x disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <y vaccine>""

""i'm the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, i know i'm right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc..."" 

i've tried explaining to her the basic idea of ""correlation doesn't equal causation."" by showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. she followed that one up with ""we aren't talking about ice cream and murder, we're talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! they're completely different!""

i've tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn't as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. she follows that up with ""those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and ""big-pharma""

she won't budge and hasn't budged for weeks now. our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and i'm worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could've been easily avoided. 

i am in florida. is there anyway i can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife's knowledge? what are my options here? legally speaking, what kind of leeway do i have? i don't want this to lead to divorce but i just feel quite lost at the moment. 

edit: thank you to everyone for your advice! i come to the decision that i will try and sit my wife down one last time, as i am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome i desire. if that fails, i have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because i know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child. will keep you updated",2

"tx - update. i informed the father of his possible two kids who are married to each other.. met up with him after work and got right down to it. i informed him that his son in law had asked me to find his dad and that i have a very good idea of who it was. 

he did not take the news well when i told him his son in law was probably his son. lots of screaming. lots of blaming me. eventually lots of apologizing to me. i told him i would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. i told him to get a dna test done and that i would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a dna test being done first to prove it. he agreed this was a good idea. his thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. i told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

i told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a dna test proving parentage. 

he agreed without any hesitation. 

so now its a waiting game. the lab i use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. the dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. i did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

"my ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised daughter. update.. wow, that last post got real popular it seems(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aqylaa/co_my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/), for better and for worse. seeing as you guys got were interested in it i thought i would come back with an update. 

&#x200b;

well, a lot has happened since that day. my daughter is safe with me and was let out of the hospital about a week ago. she is getting better every day. i know though, you guys want the full story so here it is

&#x200b;

after i made that post i took the advice given to me and the next time i saw my daughter i told her that it was wrong of me to ask her to keep secrets and that it's ok to tell her mom. along with that i saw a lawyer recommended to me by a trusted party. when i went to see him he told me that this is ""a case lawyers salivate over"" and that my ex is in a lot of trouble. i immediately filed for emergency custody of my daughter. i also got into contact with the doctor again and explained the situation fully to him. he says that while he will not be getting lawyers involved that he wishes for me to submit the evidence to the police and file a report. along with this, my lawyer has gotten into contact with the court that originally ordered us to vaccinate our daughter and has handed over everything i gave to him. he has advised me to stay quite on this matter so i'll leave it at my ex is in a lot of trouble with them. 

&#x200b;

during this time, my ex started to get suspicious. maybe it was because a friend told her about a post on reddit and she freaked out? who knows. a few days later when i saw her at the hospital we had an altercation. she became hysterical and yelled various threats and insults at me. including telling me that i want to ""poison our daughter"" right in front of our sick child. she was escorted out of the building and the head nurse had banned her from coming back. after this she sent me a barrage of texts telling me that i am a monster and that if she had vaccinated her that she would be dead now. this was sent to my lawyer. as he puts it, ""she's what lawyers dream of when they hear who's on the other side of the court.""

&#x200b;

outside of this, i've been advised to stay as quite as possible so i'll leave it with this. 

&#x200b;

this week i received emergency custody of my daughter until our custody hearing later this year. i have heard that the da is slowly getting ready to move forward with a multitude of charges against my ex and that will land her in jail soonish.

&#x200b;

and that's really it for now. i'm going to follow the advice given by my lawyer and say nothing else to anyone. i do not want the media involved in this for a few reasons so i've left this as vague as possible. when this is all said and done, if the interest is still there i may come back again. but for now, thanks for the advice in the original thread, me and my daughter appreciate you all.

"overheard my 26m fiance 24f tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort."". 

update 2: just did one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. today after breakfast i told her we should ""sit down and talk."" she was hesitant, but i said it was important. we went to the living room and she said to me ""i already know what this is about."" my post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" of course the water works started happening right away. i told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. through her tears, she said ""i was just joking, i wasn't serious."" she then went on saying stuff like ""i love you, i love you."" i told her i can't be in a marriage where my s/o doesn't love me the same way i love them. she tried to tell me that she loved me and that i meant something to her. but it was all bullshit. she said she ""didn't want to lose me."" i told her i don't think this marriage was the right decision. and from there i basically told her it was over. i told her i knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. for all those wondering, we have no kids, and i pay fully for the apartment we live in, and i own almost everything we have other then her clothes. i even pay for her car. so after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, i've never been so happy with a decision i've made in my life. after that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""fuck you."" she started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" i told her i could do whatever i wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. she screamed at me saying, ""you're the fucking worst relationship i've ever been in. you think i can't find someone again?"" ""do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? you're a fucking idiot my name."" she grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""i'm leaving!"" before slamming the door behind her. at that moment i felt like i was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of tv. i sat down on the couch and cried, and i'm still crying as i type this up. it's both happy and sad tears, and i knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. she never loved me, it was obvious. our relationship only went one way, and i feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier i live in california, and i'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. tomorrow, i'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (i'm not throwing out her stuff. just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. all of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and i know my life will certainly improve as a result.

edit/update: thanks everyone for the kind words! really has made me feel a lot better! going to be talking to her soon. also, i noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, i understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. i've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. also i used an old alt since she uses reddit. anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. i'm going to talk to her today. i will be updating you all soon after.

edit: meant to put wife in the title but now i can't change it.

basically the title. i overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while i was passing the bedroom. this friend is in a serious relationship. my wife then said to her, ""sweetie, remember it's your choice. don't settle for just anyone. that's the mistake i made. who knows who else i could of had. my name was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. does she even love me? why am i being treated as a second base? 

am i being dramatic and overreacting? i haven't said anything about it since. i honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",8

"a man's fence is broken and he neess to hire someone to fix it. so he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a buddhist monk who will do it for free.

"my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help.. hi, everyone. this will probably be lengthy as i have nobody in my life to talk to about this. this is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

my wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. we have been together for 11 years and married for 8. she has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. she previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. we also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

the following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""standard operating procedures"" of our household:

&#x200b;

* if i touch a light switch i need to wash my hands
* if i touch a door knob i need to wash my hands
* if i go to the garage i need to take a shower before i      can sit down or do anything
* if i touch her pajamas or i touch towels then i need to      take a shower
* if i *even enter* the guest bathroom then i have      to take a shower
* if my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* i am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* she stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much tp as a regular person would).      the cleaning process is 3 chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. i have to immediately shower after this.
* if she spills excess *water* on the floor then i      have to mop it and anywhere i walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where i walked after stepping in the water.
* she goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. she washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. if she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. if,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      if her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. she discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. she uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" as you can see, this adds up      and i end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. this doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* if i change out laundry and **i graze the doorframe** when i enter the bedroom with clothes, i have to discard all of them.
* if an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* if i even *touch* the dishwasher i have to wash my      hands.
* if she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will not      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. this means if she is hungry or thirsty i will bring it to her.
* her showers last around 40 minutes. she bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. our water bill is ridiculous.
* if my son (2 yo) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. this includes      naps. if i take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* when i clean the house (which i dont mind, btw.      cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. no deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200b;

1. change out laundry and leave washer free
2. wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. sanitize all counters
6. clean kids bathroom
7. take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. take shower
12. put bathroom rugs in washer
13. take shower
14. sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. mop house in very specific order
16. take shower

i want to make this clear - i have no problem with cleaning but i often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and i get berated. my wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. often, i have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so i will be doing it after midnight. of course i will make mistakes when i am mentally exhausted.

&#x200b;

* if i bring her water, i have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. she thinks that      if i hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. i do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* if i have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. she thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. this is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* if my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. he gets out often because she wont close the door.
* my wife **will not touch doorknobs**. she uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* if i leave the house with my phone, i cannot bring it      back into the house until i sanitize it. that includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* no shoes on the in house, ever. i had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. i had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop twice where they walked.
* her depth perception is abysmal. we get in so many      fights because she thinks that i touched her with a dirty object when i      was *halfway across the room.* when she gets dressed, i half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. same with pants.
* we never have people over because of her fear of      infection. plus, i am the one who has to clean and sanitize so i am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

there is more things i have to deal with but i cannot remember every situation right now. the worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). i have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. i wash my hands over 50 times a day. i have gotten to the point where i just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. i fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. i get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. and this is not because of my kids.

you may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" we did that about two months ago. my dad may be the only person who really knows what i am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. that is exactly what i did. i told the counselor everything that i just revealed to all of you. i have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" the counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. my wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. after the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

i want to say one last thing. before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. we loved each other and felt we were meant to be. i still love her and want it to work. i have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. i am physically and mentally exhausted. i have thought of leaving multiple times but i am afraid of how it will affect my kids. we also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. my wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (i dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? thank you for taking the time to read and i appreciate any and all advice.

**tl;dr** \- my wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

&#x200b;

edit:  i want to make something clear.  my children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  they dont do what i do - that is the one thing i absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  but yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  i talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how i feel - again.  she broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  when i get home we will continue to address this.

"(update) bought a ps4 from walmart for christmas and it had books in it. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a98686/bought_a_ps4_from_walmart_box_had_books_in_it_and/

ever since discovering right before christmas that the ps4 spiderman combo my wife purchased for our son had books in it and took it in to get a new one it's been an extremely annoying and stressful time.

i took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""we stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. so i've been back to the same walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. i wasn't yelling, or causing issues i just want the ps4 my wife purchased for our son for christmas. 

so the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""i believe this man has been trying to scam us since christmas eve claiming his ps4 had books in the box"". cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that i've been constantly dealing with and i get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

i again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

so the outcome? no ps4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and i cannot do a chargeback. if you are ever purchasing anything expensive from walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. merry christmas walmart.

"my friend brought her new date over for dinner and i jokingly vetted him in front of everyone by asking if'd ever killed anyone. he said yes.. as it's often the case, this didn't happen today, but a few years ago when i was maybe 15yo, young and naive.

my mom's best friend back then was v, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.

v is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. after losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. she brought to our home a few men over the years.

one of those times, v had invited over for dinner a man (let's call him a) who she introduced to us as a ""good friend"". a was a middle-aged man originally from bosnia. he now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.

for those of you not fully aware of bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. it's a small country in the balkans (eastern europe, north of greece), and it used to be part of the former yugoslavia. long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including a.

that evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know a better. he seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. we start asking him questions about how long he's been out of bosnia, etc.

i start to think of something witty to say to ""vet"" him. something funny.

i asked him if he'd ever killed someone, jokingly.

he looked at me, all serious. he said yes. everyone became silent.

he went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. they were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person's. he wasn't a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.

i felt horrible for asking this. when i thought i was just making a joke, i opened up some really painful memories. things that were not easy for him. still today, many years later, i can't imagine how he must feel living with such memories. and it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.

after a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. we never spoke about that again.

—

tl;dr: i thought i'd make a funny joke and ask my friends' date at dinner if he'd ever killed anyone. turns out, he did during the civil war in former yugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. the joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day.",4

"by showing my grandmom that she had been living a lie for almost 30 years.. this did happen today. my grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. she doesn't eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. one of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. she says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. so she keeps changing the position of my bed when i am away for work. when i come back, i reposition it my way so that i don't get sunlight on my face early morning. 
today, she was repositioning the room while i was there which annoyed me. so i took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that i was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. infact i was pointing east . i instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. and she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. i pointed it out to her. i thought she would take it lightly. oh man i was wrong. i fucked up biig time. she lost herself. she started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. i am looking at her old compass right now and i can say it doesn't seem right at all. i think i will have to fix this issue today itself. she is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn't great. how stupid am i. 

tl;dr : i fucked up by showing my grandmother that she was sleeping with her bed pointing north which she is strictly against cause of her superstitious beliefs. she did not take it well . 

edit 1: a lot of you are asking me how she moves furniture at the age of 90. well she doesnt do it herself, she has a helper who is supposed to take care of her personally but my grandmother doesn't like the idea of employing someone particularly for her so she gives her household chores to keep her busy.

"we spend too much time discussing homosexuality when only ~4% of the population is gay, but meanwhile 80% of the population of the planet lives in poverty.. i get human rights, ending discrimination, etc and i am 100% on board; but the amount of time spent talking about something that affects so few people and the amount of posturing by the affected parties is insane.  i agree it's important, but it's nothing you need a parade for.  there are waaaay bigger issues that get very little traction, such as the number of people living in poverty, even in the most developed nations.  why is that?  is it that the issues that affect huge percentages are too difficult to address?  is it that no one in hollywood is poor, but a disproportionate number are gay, so there is no platform for poverty?  is the feeling that poverty is a choice?  why don't we have parades for teachers or people who are working to better the world for much larger percentages of the population?

disclaimer - i know it's been a long, hard fight for basic human dignity for homosexual people.  i don't debate that and i have tremendous respect for those people who suffered and continue to suffer for this cause. not only respect, but gratitude.  the world as a whole is definitely better because of their sacrifices. but still...

edit - added sources for the statistics i used, as people seem to be going down that tangent. maybe not the best sources, but the first that popped up and seemed legit. i appreciate the debate around what's defined as poverty, i think it's a good debate. but even if you only count people who are literally starving, it's still twice as many people and that doesn't invalidate my initial statement. have a nice day!

"(update) school kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. lawyers are expensive.... original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

the past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. now i can't go into a lot of the details after but i can go over some of the details that happened during.

we contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. we first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. so he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which i thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

he spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. during this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

so our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. the lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

now i can't go into a lot of the details but i can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. i just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. we are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school.",2

"for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job?. not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. i got called an asshole for it, so now i have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

i met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. two nights ago was our third date and i was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. nothing fancy, i just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. this girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. she's funny, charming, and smart. we had had several great dates and i was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. she is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

our waitress for dinner was great. actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. at one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

at the end of the meal, she brought the check and i told her i would like to speak with her manager. she asked if there was something wrong, and i calmly repeated that i would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. she leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and i proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. he thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

the only one not happy was my date. she said, ""if that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that i was full of myself. she didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. i texted her saying i was sorry for whatever i did wrong and that i'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

it all started when i posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor william h. macy. i couldn't stop laughin over it but i never thought it would gain so much attention. 

however it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes i could have imagined. this alone was crazy for me because i never expected to have a submission on the front page.

when i checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links i received. i checked them and found my submission on the latest jimmy kimmel show with reddit co-founder alexis ohanian. i was mind blown over this.

they proceeded talking over reddit users and jimmy ended up checking my history. well i hardly ever post filthy stuff but i commented on a nsfw a few days ago and i think jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

i don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. on the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. however i regret nothing!

"lost my temper and told my wife to ""just shut up already, you don't get a say in this"" after her constant inconsiderate nagging. asking for blunt honesty here because i can't deal with this drama right now so just tell me if i've been an asshole and if so i'll go and apologise. 

i'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). my mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. in particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

this women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. they have a long long history of bad blood between each other. both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. obviously i think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

anyway even though i really dislike this women, i have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. she's my father's wife and 2. she was close friends with my mom. my wife was livid at finding out about this and insists i put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

so for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. i keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. i try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and i wont hold it against her. she refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

so a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and i lose my tempter. i tell her (paraphrasing)

"by trying to inflate my penis like a dick balloon.. this fuck up took place 15 years ago when i was around 11 years old.   i had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  it got me thinking about how small my penis was.    i decided i needed to do something about this.   i did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   

now, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  i however knew that i had a penis, which had a hole, and i had a pump.   the pump i had, was a soccer ball pump.   the ones with the little metal needle.  well i examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   i stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   i decided the pain would be worth it.   i pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   it inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   since i was 11, i was not an anatomy expert.   the sensation gave me an erection, so i decided it must be working.  i inflated again.   it hurt a little this time, and now it felt like i had to pee.   i wanted results though, and people always say ""no pain, no game.""   i pushed the handle down again.   now i really fucking had to pee.

i removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   the sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   however, i really fucking had to pee.   i pushed super hard.   no man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  i get to claim that i guess.   the air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   it really hurt my dickhole.   amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    i can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.

15 years later it still hurts when i pee occasionally.  i am considering going to a urologist one day, however i am not sure how to address the issue.   the last thing i would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  

tldr:   i thought my penis was too small so i inflated it like a balloon.    it hurt when i peed.

"how to ruin my brother's livestream?. hey everybody,

here's something for you: my brother (in middle school) is constantly live-streaming to his two or so viewers. as a bonus, he tries to be a soundcloud rapper. 

just now he let the dog shit in the house (he was supposed to be watching her), pretended his b.b. gun was a glock and shot at some rabbits outside, punched a wall, and is now blasting some rather trash rap. he says today is his 24 hour livestream. 

it's my one day off this week and i am desperate to read some of my book and do some yoga. how can i end this bullshit? 



update: i ended up unplugging the wifi and hiding his charging cable. turns out he was using wifi, so this was pretty affective. i made him come with me to the local park, though he screamed like a massive cunt. brought a ball and we played football.

i'd like to thank everyone for there mostly legal suggestions, can't say reddit isn't creative. especially the people who talked me out of any malicious actions and suggested more kind things i could do. though i'd like to snip internet cables or have one of you lovely people hack him, i think it's better to keep his music/videos for later embarrassment. 

also, since 50% of you suggested whipping my dick out i'd just like it to be known that i'm a girl, and therefore have no massive wang to swing around",7
"south park is vasty more intellectual than rick and morty.. rick and morty is funny, and a good show. sure. but this underlying thought that it is somehow for intellectuals is absurd. i thought at first it was just a meme, something that would die off, but people still, and seriously, believe it is some how transcendent of the writing.

south park in the other hand is topical, witty, often delving into serious topics in a way that is so absurd and humorous that you don't notice how good the points they are making are until you think about it later. through crude antics and exaggerated perspectives they actually manage to say something substantial. not only that, but often they show just how absurd something is bringing an almost absolute clarity to the issue they are covering and thus it is hard to argue against it using what you may have thought before was a solid point. and they do it in a way anyone can understand and digest.",6
"update: i 22f broke up with my 34m boyfriend (7 months ago) because i found an engagement ring. he came to my work today and proposed. help me. please.. first of all i'd like to thank everyone for their input on my other post. i know it was all over the place and at first i was on the defence in the comments and refusing to see the situation from any angle other than my own, but as time when on and i got more responses/messages, my point of view has shifted. thank you for really persevering with me and helping me to see it from a different side. i really appreciate it. 

if you kept up with the last post and followed it to any extent, then you will know that i was meeting with my ex after work today to discuss the whole proposal and to discuss the whole relationship in general. well, i did. he came to my place after work. and i'm crying as i type this, because the majority of you were right about him. my heart feels broken and i don't know what to do from here. i can go into a lot more detail on this post as opposed to my last one, and i can clarify things more now because i'm no longer defending him. this post is gonna be a very long post so, i'm warning you now you may be here long.

when he came around to my house, my best friend had came too for support and she went upstairs and kept the bedroom door open to make sure that if i needed any help then i could get it. he was not happy that she was there, i told him that's the only way i'll speak is if she's there because i don't think being alone together is appropriate.
first of all, he went on a tangent about how i should never of made that post and that i was stupid to do it, he's asked me like 1000 times to remove it, because i changed the password to the account before i made the post he's extremely angry he can't take it down. he was focused on that at the beginning until our conversation progressed, and he was getting incredibly irate such as pacing back and forth, huffing and puffing, throwing things. whenever he made accounts, he would always make sure that everything to do the account was in his control. 
for those of you who didn't read the comments previously, or for those who just wanted more info, when me and him were together he would have me make accounts which were solidly adult content. 

first of all it started with a tumblr where he would post the content we'd make together such as pics/vids and share them with his friends and brag, then that progressed into making me reddit accounts where he'd have me post any sexual experiences we'd had together or sexual experiences that he'd planned for me. most of which, i weren't comfortable with. i mentioned last time in the comments he'd use phrases like ""if you love me, you'll do it"", ""you know how happy it would make me"", ""you'll enjoy it"", ""vanilla is boring, you don't want me to be bored"", and those are just the ones that stick in my mind, there's more. he'd use those phrases to get me to engage in certain sexual behaviour, he'd involve his friends, have us do cnc, specifically plan for something to happen and do so he could then get me to write a detailed post about it. the public posting of the experiences got him off and i wanted to make him happy.
and before you mention as multiple people have on the first post - this current account which i'm posting this on, he made and had me use during our break up and he asked me to delete all the other accounts and posts and instead repost them on this account. stupidly i didn't question his intentions and i know i was naive, i just thought as i hurt him it was the least i could do. obviously to him, that meant he still had some sort of control over me even despite our break up. also him not having access to it anymore really fuelled him.

we spoke about our sex life, and i asked him why he treated me like basically a sex toy, why he would pressure me into doing all of those things when he knew i was apprehensive, and he denied it. said there was no pressure from him, just that he thought i would enjoy all those things and i'd want to do them with him because the thought i would want a 'healthy' sex life (his words). honestly, by this point when he was talking i could just see through his bullshit, and it was having no affect on me anymore, just making me angry. just from that, i started to feel a bit more sane and like i could finally stand up for myself and like my feelings for him were no longer blinding me. i was just angry that he would blatantly lie to my face, we argued over it and in regards to that he snapped at me and said ""you should consider yourself lucky that i've not put any of what i have on you on social media, i could ruin your life but i choose not to because i love you and i'm not that type of person""
like, fucking really? who even says that? that's such a passive threat. so, now i'm expecting that to happen some point soon.

then the conversation moved onto that god damn ring. i told him that it was inappropriate and unfair of him that after 7 months of no romantic contact or talk, that he would propose out of the blue. i told him i didn't want to marry him, or even be with him now. he didn't like that, and got aggressive with me. told me i'd never find anyone like him, how no one would ever marry me especially because i can't have kids so i'm useless to most men so i should marry him because he ""loves me more than life"" and would never hurt me, all whilst getting up in my face and poking me on the forehead, obviously in an attempt to make me feel small and like he's in charge. 
i kept telling him on what planet does he think he can do all this and then just expect me to roll over and take it? and his response was ""you did for 4 years"". so, the majority of you were right, to him i was literally just some inexperienced girl who he could manipulate and take advantage of, he clearly didn't love me. and all of this actually hurts, because i genuinely loved this person, and now i'm confused about how i could've been so naive to not notice anything. part of me thinks i was so preoccupied with ending up like my parents that i missed all the warning signs and like many of you said - it became a self fulfilling prophecy. 

i gave him the ring back and told him i don't want to see him anymore, he then turned to begging after he realised intimidation wasn't working. literally, him on his knees with crocodile tears and his arms wrapped around my legs telling me how much he loves me, he'll buy me whatever i want (i've never been financially dependent on him, i have my own place) and do whatever i want him to do to make it right. i told him there's nothing i want from him anymore and that i want him to leave, and just like before he flicked back to being aggressive. it wasn't poking me in the face or anything, he was 'hugging' (more like restraining) me, kissing, groping me, putting his hands down my pants/up my top whilst telling me it'll make me feel better and i'll remember why i love him. at which point there was a knock at the door, my friend thankfully had text her dad what was going on and he came around and asked him to leave otherwise the police will be phoned, and he told him to never contact me again or he'll make him feel as intimidated as he was making me feel. his face was a picture, he really didn't like someone talking to him the way he speaks to me.

so he said he'd leave, in the process of leaving he threw the ring box at my head, no idea why, literally zero point. my friends dad pushed him out the door whilst he was shouting all sorts of abuse at me. and that was the end of that.
now i'm expecting he's not going to leave me alone, especially after the passive aggressive threat that he could ruin my life, i've asked to talk to my manager tomorrow so i can warn her of what happened and that he may post stuff about me on social media in an attempt to get me to lose my job.
my best friends dad said he'll take me to the police station tomorrow and we'll start a report because he's worried that after what my friend told him that it won't be the last i hear from him, so at least if anything else happens i've started one and can eventually get a restraining order against him.

thank you for all your advice, seriously. i received a lot of criticism on my last post but i'm thankful to the people that kept giving me advice even when i was defending him and in denial, without you i wouldn't of had the courage to end it. i also wouldn't have been able to see it from a different perspective because i was so far under his spell.
i'm pretty upset right now, because this was my first proper relationship and i did genuinely love him, and now because i know he was manipulating, taking advantage of me and treating me like a fetish i don't really know what to think, and i feel stupid and like an idiot that i didn't notice it. and now i don't know where i go from here, and i'm worrying he's going to get even more irrational, aggressive or weird with me because he's really not happy.
i've already spoke to my doctor this morning about counselling, so i'll be starting the healing process soon. i guess i've gotta focus on myself now. i'll be expanding my friendship group too and letting people know i won't be going to any events if he's there etc, i've blocked him on all social media, i know he'll be here reading this though because he doesn't need an account to read so blocking him will do nothing.
i just hope i can get through this.

"if your flight gets cancelled while you are at the airport, don't approach the ticket agent, but call the 1800 number to re-book your flight.. everyone on the flight will be looking to get on the next best option and a lot of them will be annoyed or upset, adding stress to you, those around them and the agents. your best move is to sit down and call the 1800 number of your airline where a person will be able to re-book you before the red-faced screamers ahead of you in line.

"telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.. there's a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. she looks like this(https://i.imgur.com/hqmuqng.jpg).

if you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell.

now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. she doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

i see this as extremely strange behavior. it's almost as if nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. that's why they leave these comments.

this is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while i'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, i don't think this is a good kind of attention. i think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

it wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. all caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. it's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. it's actually kind of disgusting. i don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

really, i just feel sorry for this girl. i wonder if she understands what's going on.

edit: there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. in case it's unclear, i'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a basis in science(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what i'm talking about. remember that nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

"what happened to my brain damage settlement?. when i was in 7th grade a man slammed into the side of the car i was in and effectively smushed open the top of my head. there was glass in my brain and small pieces were smashed off. my left foot was pushed to my head effectively snapping my shin. my heart ended up stopping for a while and i was revived. i went through brain surgery, pt, and alot of therapy for the mental trauma of still being concious for parts of it...

i hate to bring this up at all but i know i was awarded a very large settlement to be awarded in blocks in the ages of 21, 23, then finally 25. im grateful to be alive and i don't want to be a money grubber, but i feel that was rightfully mine or at least i have a right to know the details. my parents assured me that the settlement would be mine and it would pay for my college and grad school yet i'm about to be 23 and whenever i bring it up they tell me it's none of my business? 

again i really hate to do this but i'm not a money grubber. ive paid rent since 14 and always paid my way through college. it's just i want to at least know the details of the case instead of being told its none of my business...also my dad has bought two new buildings with money i don't know came from. i'm not saying i'd ask for it back, for all i know it paid for my heavy medical bills...but i still have a right to know. how do i do that without help from my parents?

"insecure gf caught flirting. throwaway for obviousness. this is gonna be a long one. 

where to begin? girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. friends, coworkers, acquaintances. even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

fine. i love her. i understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it's not that big of a deal even though i've lost sleep over it. 

girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. one of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. while i can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. some of these stories i've never heard before. call it insecurity but i've never asked a woman if she's had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. i asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she's put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. what?

a few days roll by and she's continued these talks with this person. we've had our arguments and came to an understanding of 'if he does or says anything that crosses a line' she will end the friendship. 

but where is the line? he's already had her describe herself. explain past relationships. sex talk and favorite kinks. taking until hours in the morning. where is the fucking line?

i told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me i have nothing to worry about. 

well. 

i just looked at her phone.

and while i wish i didn't. i'm glad i can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. they've been flirting. the questions via text were 10x worse. and her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her s/o. 

but what's worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that i'm being insecure and allow him to chime in that i'm creating disorder. then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. and her saying yes.

"by accidentally doing my black history month project on a white guy. in 5th grade, i had a black history month project where i had to make a presentation on a person of my choice. i looked up 'important african americans' and found a wikipedia page with a list of famous black people, or so i thought. i chose allan mcleod cormack, a south-african american scientist, seeing that he invented the ct scan. i put my blood sweat and tears into that project. two days before the project was due i decided to put a picture of cormack on my poster. to my confusion, all i could find was a picture of this white guy. turns out, he was a white south african. i made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. she let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but i had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month.

"the problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them.. negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view.

this happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

this is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

i would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary, with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter.

"by quoting thanos while arguing with my gf. trowaway account for privacy, this happened yesterday and i don't know how to make it up.

my girlfriend and i met at university 4 years ago, and we both graduated some time ago. since then we've both been looking for work, but the research is more difficult than we thought, and until yesterday neither of us had managed to get a job. yesterday my girlfriend received a positive answer to one of her applications, for a job located 430 kilometers from our hometown. she was very happy and that's how she told me to come to her house to tell me some good news about the research. so expecting some good news, i took a detour to buy her sushi because we both love it, and i arrived at her house early in the evening, and that's when she tells me that in two weeks she's going to go more than 400 kilometers from our city, and that i now have to look in the same area as her. i totally lost my mind when she told me that. i explain that i understand that the research is complicated, but that it was no reason to look at work across the country, and that i had no desire to leave my family and friends because my life is in my hometown. the situation then became very tense, she told me that i am selfish and that i have to learn to move away, that even if there is no urgency, it is important to find a job quickly so as not to remain inactive. i then offered her a long-distance relationship for a few months because i really don't want to leave, and she could come back as soon as she found a job in our city. and that, guys, she took it really hard, i've never seen her so upset in my life. she then gave me an ultimatum: either i follow her or we stop our relationship, and she asks me if i'm really ready to leave her to stay with my family and friends. maybe some people can see it, but this is the moment i fucked up.

i still don't know why my brain betrayed me like that, but the only answer i could find was : ""perhaps, maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation"". i could have made long rants to show her that i love her, that i care about her. i could have found arguments so that we could solve the situation, as any person in a relationship for 4 years would do. but no, my fucking stupidity made me quote a purple guy. she looked at me with an empty look for several seconds, i realized how much i fucked up, but nothing came from my mouth. she just asks me to leave her house, and since yesterday she speak to me or answer my calls and messages. i sent her a very long message of apology, adding that i hope we will be able to resolve the situation, but still no answer.

i am now staring my thanos funko pop thinking how much this guy may have ruined part of my life.

&#x200b;

edit : whoah, this blew up far more than i could imagine. i took time to read all your comments, and i spend a big part of my day speaking with my gf about the situation. so here's the situation : 1) she's mad that in such a situation my only answer was quoting a meme, 2) she thinks (and she's not the only one from what i read) that i'm still a child for wanting to stay in my city.

to clarify some things i'm living in a small country in europe, that's why 400km is basically across the country. then i admit it, i may not be ready to start my professional life. in my head i'm still a student who always wants to enjoy his life like it was : going out with friends, enjoying parties in the middle of the week, watching sports and taking care of my gf. for me, the best to start my work life was to find a job in my city to keep my bearings and my way of life and to be able to gradually switch to something more serious. that's a big part of why a freaked out when she told me to come far away from everything that defines my life. also yes, there was a big lack of communication in my relationship, she's the first to admit it and apologizes for it.

today we had a more serious discussion (no meme quotes guys !) where both of us expressed their point of view. for my gf, this work is not her dream work, but she wants to take it because we can't find nothing here and she just wants to take it in order to gain experience, and then quit it to a better opportunity. she told me that it would only be a matters of months. i explained my feelings and what i wanted to start my life, and to my surprise she understood. we even reached an agreement : i will looking for a job in my city and in the city where she will work, and i will take the first opportunity. she also needs me to be with here the first month to help her settle in and not to stress about her new situation.  now that we've explained and reached a compromise, she's much calmer and ready to go on, so it seems my stupidity and the purple guy may have not ruined something.

oh, i saw some people were wondering : when i left her house yesterday, i didn't take back the sushi

thanks for your help and for pointing me in the right direction.

my sister and i contacted the state department, the embassy and the consulate in karachi. they were able to verify that she exists and she's a us citizen. we told them of what's happening to her and they were quite helpful in telling us what to do and being ready to help her as soon as possible. 

the challenge was getting her into the consulate in karachi but she actually got herself there (took weeks of planning) where they gave her travel documents to be able to come to the us. we bought tickets for her to go from karachi to doha and then to boston where we picket her up from the airport. 

by the time her parents realized what's what she was on the doha to boston flight. her parents tried to apply for a visa to come to the us but their visa applications were refused. i'm not aware if the people at the embassy who refused it actually knew about my cousin's supituation or not but we're glad they weren't able to come here.

she currently lives with me and my sister and my sister has been granted guardianship over her. her priority is to learn english.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

tldr for the 1st post: last monday, soon after i left for night school, my son (5) reported to my wife that our (deaf & mute) neighbor touched his private parts.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

&#x200b;

update: on tuesday morning the entire family went to the police station to file a report. my wife and i interviewed with an officer and detective together at 1st and then my wife alone. after that the detective contacted the county prosecutor's office.

an hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and i to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. the detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

from there we went home.

that afternoon, neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. i opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. soon after i went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. when i got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

for the most part, wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. we did not see neighbor all day. wednesday night, we came to know why. a detective called to let us know neighbor had been taken into custody on tuesday night (while i was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (i assume arraignment).

thursday morning a woman from the state dcf/cp&p office came to the house. she made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & i together. to my mind, this was actually a good thing.  she was able to let us know that neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (i don't recall exactly what they are). she also provided 2 other important facts:

1 – neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in california.

2 – neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on tuesday evening.

from there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. we will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

while she was there i asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if neighbor was likely to be free again soon. she was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. she informed us that neighbor's hearing was set for monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. she wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have neighbor remain in custody.

here's the thing. neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family… and they have small children. i advised the detective that we were ok with neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. she confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. we agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom neighbor lives should have input.

that brings us up to date and, to be honest, i am torn. i hate what this man did. i hate that it has happened before, and i never want it to happen again. with that said, at first i was unsure as to whether or not neighbor even knew what he did. he clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. but he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing…. as he admitted the act to the arresting detective. i get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute lennie from of mice & men, and that tears my heart out. i don't think he really understands, and i don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. at the same time, he touched my son. if there were no clear impairment, i would want to take a baseball bat to his head. but there is, and instead i just feel like shit for everyone involved. this sucks, full stop.

on a more selfish note, the megan's law registry. there are a handful of homes for sale in the area. until now, my wife and i were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. that hope is now over. because neighbor's history all predates mega's law, he was not on the registry. now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. i realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. to repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

sorry for the book, and if the mods see fit to remove the update… as it's not all that particular to legal matters, i understand. honestly, i just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

"for kicking my husband out of the house because he lied to me about money. my husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole ""i don't have money for gas"" victim part. this money is not part of our savings or anything. anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. during those two weeks i bought groceries for us, i paid for our take out food, i offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall i was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. he saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. he let me pay for his car insurance. he heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.

yesterday i asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and i didn't have cash. he got really nervous when i asked him if i could borrow his debit card. he started to act strange. i asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. i asked him if he was hiding money from me? and he denied it and said i was paranoid and crazy.

he checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. he literally shouted, ""wow wow wow i have extra money!!!! oh my god this is so awesome!!"" and he played the whole i didn't know part.

he continued to argue and i told him that i don't care about the money i care about honesty. why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.

it took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly i was going to ask for some money if i knew. he said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.

today i asked him to leave the house. i called him cruel and deceitful. i told him that i don't want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.

by the way i'm 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. we've know each other for 3 years.

am i the as*hole for leaving him over this? 
i'm just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. and now i'm questioning everything in our relationship. maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. i don't know anything anymore.

i thought that i had a pretty happy marriage with ""jonas"". we have been together for over 11 years now and married for 9. we have twins (f8).

jonas works in a branch of business were he spents 3 months outside and 3 months at home. during this time he will visit us and we will visit him. it is i convinient but he earns really good. so good so that i needn't work if i didn't want to.

during all those years i have never suspected him if cheating. he was always ""super honest"" with me and would even tell me about attraction to other people he felt.

so this comes all of the blue for me. jonas is away on a business trip for the weekend.
a woman knocked on my door. she introduces herself as ""cherry"". when i asked her what it was about she broke down crying. i took her in and after calming her she started to tell me this story about jonas. apparently she and jonas have been together for over 6 years and have a little boy (3)together.

we were both fooled because he keeps his life there completely separate from our life here. he has 2 different sets of social media accounts. and as his parents sadly passed away in a car accident 15 years ago he didn't have to introcude either to them.

at first i was livid and screamed at her. till i calmed down as she was just a victim.

apparently chery found out my(our) husband has an apparemment that was paid for by the company (were he would take me if i visit) trough some bank statements. she searched his keys and went snooping. there is were she found out about us and decided she wanted to tell me the truth after thinking for over 3 months about it.

we both cried our eyes out together. cursed out jonas and now she is sleeping on my couch.

she is not legally married to jonas as he sold her the ""i don't believe in marriage spiel"". the only legal spouse he has is me. i know i have to divorce him but maybe i just need some extra advice and a little husband roasting. also should i keep in touch with chery and should we introduce our kids?

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

"for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby?. my son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. he is only 17 and she is 16. i told him i was proud that he came forward to tell me, but i didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. according to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". we tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

since then, the house has been quite tense. any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. i have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. since my son told us they were pregnant, i have done the following:

1. i wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. i open the door, scream as loud as i can until i know he is awake, and i shut the door. i've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. i purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. i have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, i shut off the internet until he changes it. i will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. while playing one of his games, i told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. i placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. while he was doing this, i went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. i told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. i have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. when he presses me for a reason, i tell him ""you dont have a babysitter. you can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" he has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. yesterday, i did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. i told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. this was the last straw for him.

after his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. he told me i am being completely unrealistic. i reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything i have done so far he has done to me in the past.

his mother tells me i am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but i don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. if anything, i want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

first i just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  i can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

i took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  i had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  it wasn't until i got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that i was able to try and move on.  my wife and i actually met in a soccer league we were in together. we've had so much trust for so long that i thought those fears had gone away.  it wasn't until now that i really started to feel shaken like that again.

but i didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  a few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

it's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. i didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  i got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. i couldn't wait any longer.  i made our favorite omelets, and told her i needed to talk about something.

""you know i'm not ashley, right?""

she knows me well.  ashley's my ex who cheated.

so first i apologized.  i apologized because i let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  what should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

we talked for a while.  i told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. i told her how much i loved the relationship that we've built together, and i felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  she had never given me a reason not to trust her and that i still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  she thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  she volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

but something still felt off.  i honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  normally she would have been upset that i didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling i couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

it seemed like she was saying all the right things, but i couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  maybe i'm just being paranoid.  maybe there's a gut feeling that i need to listen to.  but i ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if i still needed the surgery.

turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  i've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. so i brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. the urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that i wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. he mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

being there didn't really help.  i feel like i just got more uncertainty.  

she had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  we talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. she seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. she promised to do it in the morning.  i asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

there's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  i really couldn't put my finger on it.  we were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and i couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had sunday.

i've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but i haven't been able to focus.  we have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  this morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. we don't do that, she's never needed to before.  and i checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time thursday that i mentioned i was busy working on-site. we were supposed to go together.

i'm starting to go crazy. how do i bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  i'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  but i need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if i'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**tl;dr had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  urologist said i had obstructive azoospermia, implied i should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think i could be fertile.  wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when i can't go.  getting a second urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

update:  i've been trying to center myself.  we talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  she claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  i didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  i'm just trying to not overreact right now. i don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and im a father! or...not.  thankfully she's not working late today.  

thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

update:  i went for a long run to clear my mind.  gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  i'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why i've still been struggling personally with some of them.  regardless of what happens i'm done with any confusion left between us.

  thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"update mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.. the reaction to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

i am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and i am still processing it.

i did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and i know where i now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

i am not sure i would have had the courage to say what i had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

i think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. it makes me uncomfortable knowing i am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. a lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

i have so far went through 40% (i estimate) of the comments, but i have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

the conclusion is that i am definitely going to college, it will be the college i have always wanted to go to, and i will have the same experience as my siblings. the money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

what started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then i showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

my parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when i came back pregnant"", or something like that, i was not there, this is what she told me. i guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision i ever made"" or something like that. and their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

yeah, it went downhill from there fast. shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here i am.

dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

i did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. my brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

my grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, i guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

reading the comments was a mind opening experience. i felt unprepared for the world out there. many have asked how i had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. of course i knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

i went from ""i am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and i will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. for me it was a sudden change in reality.

going through the comments i managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. really good stuff that i think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

my parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and i haven't even read all comments. i can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. i understand his reaction, but i still feel hurt by it. i understand he was not in the best place of mind, but i can't control my feelings either. we will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

mom hasn't handled everything that well. but she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

when mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. he kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. so my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (i am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

the man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. he was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, i guess he had more important things to do. but it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

and i don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. i thought about the matter the last two weeks, since i've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if i have other siblings out there.

i was suggested to go and buy a dna kit from 23andme, maybe i can find him that way, but i think i will avoid doing this specifically so i don't find him or he finds me. as far as i care, i have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

moving forward i do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like i would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

my mom admits i've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

i did learn where i stand with my family, and it's safe to say that i am loved, and i have options. i thought i am isolated, but my world is wider than i thought. grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

i think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, i think i will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

thank you.

edit: in my family's cultural background, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well. stop calling me names, it was not a mistake, please.",8
"were you ever that 1 in 1,000,000? if so, what's your story?. ",1
"i m28 just broke up with my girlfriend over something she f27 posted on facebook. justified? did i overreact?. so we've been together about 7 months. we've had plenty of issues, but always managed to work through them and come out the other side a bit stronger. but something i found tonight just churned my stomach and it affected me so much i ended our relationship.

some backstory for context: about 2 weeks ago we had a minor argument. it started in the morning, we paused the conversation for the day while we went to work, then talked about it that night. we both got kinda heated but eventually agreed that we were arguing about something ridiculous, and reached a compromise, and everything seemed fine.

fast forward to tonight. we're laying in bed and i realize i never accepted her facebook friend request. i literally never use facebook, so this wasn't a point of contention or anything. but we weren't doing anything else so i decided to accept the request and check out her facebook (she was right next to me the whole time).

what i found really upset me. multiple shared posts that were obviously in reference to our relationship. they were just pictures of text that she had shared, not actually written herself.

the first one i found was this: ""hey, here's a cool concept: treat the people that are important to you... like they are important to you..."" i think ""hmm, is this about me?"" i feel like i make her feel important all the time. i drive 30 minutes to her house every single day. she had a birthday and i did all the things that you would expect: multiple presents, dinner, i offered a movie and drinks but she felt sick and we didn't go. i often buy her things just because. i offer her lunch nearly every day to show i'm thinking about her...

ok, maybe i'm overreacting on that one i think. that post could be about anything or anyone, so i keep scrolling. i see another one: ""if you push me away, i promise you, you won't find me where you left me""... hmm, this one obviously sounds like she's talking about our relationship. and i was a bit upset at seeing it. especially considering i never felt like i was pushing her away. i spend literally every free moment i have with her. she got upset that i wanted some alone time. she says she doesn't desire it, doesn't understand why i need it, so i pretty much did away with my private time to spend more time with her. we are constantly doing things together, and make plans to do things and go places. i never felt like i was pushing her away. if anything, i felt like i spent most of my free time trying to think of things we could do together.

i keep scrolling, and i found the one that hurt me the most: ""don't be mad when someone else starts to appreciate the person you took for granted. what you won't do, someone else will.""

that one absolutely killed me. i never thought i was taking her for granted. and the thought of her not feeling appreciated kinda floored me. on top of that, the implication is that she wants to find someone else who apparently appreciates her more than i do...

i confronted her about these posts. she said they don't mean anything. that she didn't even think about it, and that it took less than a second to hit the share button, so it's not a big deal.

i took a bit to collect my thoughts, and then i went back through our text messages to each other. turns out that every single one of these posts was made when we were in the midst of an argument/spat. that last one, the one that hurt me so much, was shared by her during the day after we had the minor argument and before we had talked it out that night.

it just felt so terrible. like, we have a very minor disagreement about something and you're thinking about finding someone else? that's what it seems like to me. am i out of my mind for thinking that? she made me feel like i was. she said i was overreacting. that she felt that way in the moment, but not now. but i can't stop myself from thinking ""if you feel this way after a minor argument, how must you feel after a serious one?"".

then there is the whole issue of airing out our dirty laundry to anyone that happens to be friends with her on facebook. anyone with a brain knows what those posts are about. by sharing them, you are essentially announcing to the world ""i'm having relationship problems!!!"". i can't help but think about the things her family and mutual friends must think about our relationship considering how often she is sharing things like that (they were all posted within this past month). to an outsider, i must seem like a fucking asshole. not treating her right. not respecting her. not making her feel important.

i just felt disgusted. i felt like i was going to vomit. i just kept seeing the words ""what you won't do, someone else will"". i know she didn't write them. but she thought them. she agreed with them. she broadcast them to the world.

i told her i knew myself well enough to know i wouldn't forget it. that anytime we had any minor argument, i would be thinking ""guess she's gonna go find someone who respects her more than i do"". i don't think i could deal with it. knowing that anytime we fight, she is having these feelings. instead of wanting to work it out, she is thinking about finding a new partner...

i broke up with her within an hour of seeing the posts. it was ugly. i feel bad. i feel tired. i've had no sleep and i have to work in like 3 hours. i don't even know why i'm posting this. the relationship is over. maybe i overreacted, maybe i was justified. i just know it felt right.

edit: lots of people saying i jumped to conclusions. i do not feel i did. the conversation went like this:

me: *scrolling through her feed for the first time* ugh, why do you post stuff like this? there is a lot of them. (this was more just general dislike at posting such childish things)

her: why? do you not like that i do that?

me: i mean... it kinda feels like you're just announcing our relationship issues to everyone.

her: but those posts could mean anything. they could be about anyone.

me: i just have a feeling that if i went through our texts and found the days and times we were arguing, they would line up with these posts.

her: yeah, maybe some of them...

we left it at that for about 10 minutes, then i decided to actually check those times and dates. they all lined up, i went through the first four shared quote thingies and they all matched with times we were arguing about something. i stopped at four because the pattern was clear.

i then confronted her, and she confirmed she posted them during arguments. i may have jumped to a conclusion, but imo it wasn't a very far leap. and she confirmed that i was right.",8

"for not telling my wife that i picked her daughter up drunk from a house party?. i'm going to try to keep this short and simple. i always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and i'll drop whatever i'm doing and i will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. i let them know that i used to be a teenager once before, i told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. we're only human and it's a part of life.

last weekend i got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. she was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

i got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. i had to pick her up and carry her to the car. i told her i was disappointed that she snuck out, but i also told her i was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

i haven't told my wife about it, because i don't want to violate the deal i made with her. i want her to know that she can trust me. i just hope i'm making the right choice.",3
"ia my father left my 3y/o daughter about $500k in a trust, ex-husband (who lives in mn) wants to use the trust funds for living expenses. my father left my daughter, who is 3, about $500k in a trust. the trustee is not a family member, but a professional trustee. my daughter is supposed to begin receiving the money at 25, but they explained that they have the power to dispense money early for the right circumstances, like a private school or medical bills - or, as they very loosely and briefly mentioned, basic living costs in an emergency hardship situation. they gave an example that if i were to become ill and unable to work, the trust could provide some level of assistance to ensure my daughter does has food on her plate and a roof over her head. however this was glossed over pretty quickly and i don't know the technical details.

about two months ago my ex husband quit his job because he said they are unwilling to be flexible with him for his debilitating migraines (his employer told me that he claims to have migraines but has never actually seen a doctor about them for treatment), and says he has been unable to find a new job and intends to instead pursue getting on disability, but expects that to take 2-3 years. he says that he will soon lose his apartment. he is unable to receive most government-based assistance because he scammed the system last year (lied about income to receive food assistance for which he was not qualified and got caught).

so, he has now approached the trustee and wants to use the trust money to pay for an apartment, utilities and a car until he is approved for disability. i was especially surprised about the car portion - he says he needs money to purchase a safer vehicle because his vehicle is old, rated poorly for crashes and does not have working seatbelts (which is a surprise to me - just a few weeks ago i buckled her into the back seat when he picked her up, so not sure what exactly he is claiming there).

i disagree with this use of the funds, particularly because he only has her for 6 days per month. i understood the ability to use the trust for living expenses should be limited to scenarios in which she is genuinely in danger of being homeless or neglected, and that is not the case as i provide everything she needs now and can do so all the time if he is unable to. my father intended the money to provide her with opportunities once she is old enough to use it wisely, not to facilitate my husband's visitation in our custody agreement.

since my ex husband has a history of committing fraud when receiving government assistance and also a history of faking illness (he lied to a previous employer to receive paid time off work claiming he was being treated for cancer when he was not), i do not trust that his intentions here are genuine. i suspect he sees the trust as a way that he can get free money so that he doesn't have to get another job.

anyhow, my question: since the trust is for the benefit of my daughter and she is obviously a minor, what can i do to ensure it is protected? should i assume that the trustee has her interests in mind and will not prematurely release money for something like this, or does it sound like there is real danger that he will drain the trust? is it possible for me to hire a lawyer to argue that the money should be saved for her later in life unless the circumstances are truly dire? i'm not sure if i can actually hire a lawyer and get them involved because i am not the trustee, the company is.

is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name our child like that.

"i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone. i am sick, devastated and don't know what to do.. first time poster so i apologize if this is rambly. to preface: i started dating david (not real name obv) at the beginning of february.  only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship i was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well that i didn't think much more about it. i fell hard and he did too. things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and i can't afford the place by myself). he and i have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and i have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time i've known him, so i didn't really see any red flags there. everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

last week i came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and i played it off like i had no idea what he was doing. fast forward to two days ago, i was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (i don't care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. so when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, i quickly peeked through his search history. there was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly ""teen"". i didn't think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then i saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. ""p*do pics"" etc had been entered around 5 times. 

i quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, i had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. i couldn't imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; i know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. so last night i peeked through his photos on his iphone and was traumatized. there were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while i'd fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. i felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

a bit further up in his photos i discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. they all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. i was numb, i was angry, i was devastated, i couldn't think and i was so disturbed at what i was witnessing. i have never seen cp in my life and i can't get these horrible images out of my head. i scrolled pretty far up and didn't really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the ""petite teen"" category. 

i guess i'm just posting here because i have no idea what else to do. i don't know how to confront him and i know i must separate from him immediately but i'm terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and i don't want to get in trouble. he must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  he practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially i am fucked by this.

"for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when i found out the child wasn't mine?. my ex and i had been together for 2 years.  it was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  i also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually i broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

a few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  she was practically beaming with glee.  i agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  didn't want my child subjected to that.

the one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  she very happily agreed.  her reaction actually washed away some of the fears i had about her possibly cheating on me.  so she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  we find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped i honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

this was a week ago.  she moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  she, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how i'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  that i have plenty of room in my home and i should just help her out.  i feel like i've been through the emotional ringer these past months and i've been though every emotion i am capable of feeling.  from realizing i was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly i feel so emotionally raw and sometimes i agree with them.  that maybe i should take her back and just care for the kid.

was i unfair to this unborn child?  am i a total piece of shit for not wanting them in my home in this vulnerable time for them?  she cheated on me, but is this a situation that i should suck it up and take care of them anyway?",3
"if you believe your employer may be discriminating against you when it comes to pay, do not be afraid to ask your coworkers what they make. it is a federally protected right to speak about salary.. in the usa, since 1935, there has been a federal law that prohibits any company in the private sector (and as of 2014, also the federal sector and federal contractors) from discriminating or terminating an employee for sharing their salary with others.

keep in mind, there are certain positions that are specifically excluded from this law:
- workers in religious schools (they must follow the school's rules)   
- agricultural laborers   
- airline employees   
- supervisors (who aren't classed as ""employees"" for this purpose)  
- independent contractors 

while it may not be specifically stated in the law, positions in human resources or financial positions may also be prohibited from speaking about pay in certain instances, since they often handle money. 

keep in mind, that while an employer can not stop you from talking about your salary in general, they are within their right to ask you not to do it on company time. 

also, keep in mind that while you are within your right to talk about salaries, you should be careful who you tell.

telling someone who has worked at your place of employment longer, that you make a lot more than them can have a potential impact on how they see you in a work environment. however, this can also give them a reference and bargaining chip during a yearly review.",9

since i'm high af the pizza delivery girl knocks i grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. i give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this is going to help me. freaked out and high i say okay and just rush inside.

right now after waking up being passed out i realize what i've done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.

"how do i (34m) break up with my long time depressed dependent girlfriend (34f) that has no life skills?. genders are actually reversed, he knows i've been browsing this sub lately and i'd prefer it if he didn't find this.

i'm ready to break up with my boyfriend of 16 years, but am not sure how. he has suffered from depression all his life, and suicide isn't new to his family. he never graduated high school, doesn't have a license, and has no job experience other than a minimum wage job his mom got for him in his early 20s that lasted a couple years... that was over 10 years ago. it's clear to me he is not interested in those things, even for us. none of his family or close friends are particularly well off or in a position to support him. 

i feel like a bad person, but i don't see a future together that i want. i just wish i'd come to this realization sooner.

we have no kids, only 3 cats. we're not married, and everything is in my name (house, car, bills, etc). only thing i can think of is he's on the bank account, but i doubt he'd have the ambition or means to do anything with it. i'd probably give him half our money (about 5k), and maybe something for the house... we've paid off about 40k of it. or technically, i have.

he's finally started seeing someone for his depression the last few months, and i worry ending things will mean he'll stop that too. i still care very much for him, but i can't keep supporting him and our relationship has been very strained this past year. 

how do i break up? i don't want to completely abandon him and take everything, i want him to have the opportunity for getting the help he needs.

update : i told him i wanted to break up. said this wasn't the life i wanted, and that i gave his sister a heads up and she's available if he wants to talk. i'd like to sort out logistics later, and we can use our couples session this thurs to work on any sticking points.

then left the house. he wants to know why now, why can't i give him a chance to work on it, why can't we work through this, etc. i had to leave, or i'm going to start saying things i regret or break down. not sure when to go back, but hey its pokemon go community day so i won't be bored (what can i say, i'm an optimist and this is me looking for the bright side)

i'm feeling a bit heartbroken right now, but thank you for all the support and encouragement, it's been really helpful to me.

update #2 : sorry for calling you fuckwads for upvoting, it was meant to be a joke. i lovingly call my friends that because the word is funny, and meant it similarly here.

i didn't expect this post to be so popular, or hit the front page. i had planned to delete it, but seeing all the advice and hearing so many people with similar stories, i'm going to leave it up. its not that i'm ashamed or trying to hide anything i wrote, its just i know this post would hurt him. i knew the risk posting online and title is different enough he may not even click if he sees it (we're 33, and he's not interested in relationship drama posts). i'll try to post other updates too. i appreciate all the encouragement,  it means a lot to me and helps keep me strong in my decision. sorry if i don't have time to reply to everyone.

and if my boyfriend or family/friends find this, i'm sorry. i don't want to hurt anyone with this post, but this is me reaching out for emotional support from internet strangers because there's nobody close i can talk to and get emotional support from that isn't also close to him, or wouldn't be biased towards our relationship. i'd rather you didn't read this.

update #3 : he's gone to stay with someone, asked me not to touch his stuff. no logistics have been discussed except it sounds like i won't see him for a bit. i've cried a lot, but am feeling lighter for it. have been messaging a couple people from family and shared friends a bit. they all heard from him first, except his sister who i gave a heads up to (with no details). it's hard at the moment, feeling they're all on his side and hearing their thoughts about it. but i wouldn't have it any other way. i want these people to be there for him when i'm not, he doesn't make friends easily.

i'm not sure i should keep airing personal drama on the internet to strangers, but it is helping me right now. gives me people to talk to, and encouragement. not sure how healthy it is in the long run, so someone tell me if it isn't good for me.

i'm tired and think i can sleep now, been a restless past few nights as i sorted this all out. will try to respond to questions later.

update #4 : i really appreciate all the support, it's more than i can read at once, but means there's always new things to read when i need it. and i've needed a lot of it.

he's back and staying in a separate room for now. this is his home too, i'm not going to force him out the first night when i've already ruined his life. i planned to keep my distance, but i'm not the kind of person that can ignore my best friend of 16 years when he really needs someone, so yes i sat with him through a rough patch tonight and we talked a bit afterwards. he knows he fucked up. i'm firm in my decision that this separation is happening though, and told him i want it done by the end of the month. if he's serious about wanting to change, he needs to do it elsewhere for himself, not here or for me.

also i'm seeing a lot of questions about if i'd take him back if he truly changed to be the man i needed. i don't know. i'm not ready for any new relationship anytime soon, but if he thinks he can sort his life out, i'd give him a second chance date to see what changed when i'm ready to go looking again. i know the chance is slim and theres no guarantees, but he could show me the new him and we'd talk. he's been my best friend for 16 years, and i still care a lot about him and think he is an amazing guy. we grew up together and been through a lot. i don't regret most of it, it's just that people change, and i changed. i'm the one that was ok with this living arangement for so long, and i'm the one that changed to realize i was not ok with it anymore too.

and to be clear, this isn't about him not having a job, or suffering from depression, or any one thing. maybe for some it is, but that's not who i am. i want a partner in life, and it's not a partnership when one person starts to feel they have all the burden of deciding where life is going and working towards those goals, and the other is argumentative and resentful when asked to help both with deciding life goals and working towards them. and is not supportive when their partner goes through a change and is reaching out to find the new normal. this has been our last year primarily,  the previous 15 were mostly good as we stumbled through life together. i want someone at my side in life who will make and work towards our shared goals, not somone i have to fight and drag along.

thank you for all the stories and support, they have really helped me both in coping and in staying firm in my decision. i'll probably stop updating this post, it's getting pretty long. maybe i'll start a new one once things are more finalized.

update #5 : it's been over a day, and harder than i thought. i thought my tears would be done by now. the optimist in me keeps looking for the path back, the one where he becomes the person i need. i miss and love him so much. but i've made my decision and now it's time for both of us to move on, in our own ways. the support here keeps me going, i can't tell you all how much i appreciate it. it's going to be a rough few weeks, but i can do this.  i keep rereading comments, and reminding myself to look to the future, not the past.

like it or not, internet strangers are my coping mechanism. i feel like this post is my diary now, is that allowed?

the lack of support for me has been hard. only his mom has asked how i've been, and wanted my side. i think she understands. we were private people, only had his mom, his 2 sisters, and his childhood friend + his wife. i knew it would be like this, wanted it this way even. i'm not close with my family, but have reached out to my sister to talk. but i still find it easier to talk to internet strangers than people i know. maybe i'll ask my therapist if he knows why that is.

he's i think out of the house for good now. not sure, but i told him either he goes, or i find a temp apartment this week. he left while i was sleeping and hasn't been back. i haven't tried to find out where, but knowing the guy he is, he left for me. he's a good guy, i wish i had said a better goodbye. given him that goodbye hug he wanted last night when he broke down and faced reality. i know it's better this way, i can't be the one there for him now. it hurts, but i know it's for the best

update #5 : it's the end of the third day, and i didn't have any big emotional breakdown today. i consider that progress. some smaller tearful events, but no breakdowns. each time it happens, i try to identify the cause. usually it's loneliness, or thinking of how much hurt i've caused someone. it's hard not to miss him, but i feel a lightness about being free. and i'm still firm in my knowledge that it's the right thing to do. bank accounts are separated, accounts rearranged, legal stuff like insurance taken care of, and my stove is cleaner than it's ever been. i'm still doing baby steps, one thing at a time. i have a therapy appointment tomorrow to talk to someone, and we have a couples appointment thursday to start talking about splitting up assets.

i've barely seen or talked to him since i broke it off. i don't want to push about splitting up assets, or what to do with his stuff just yet. i said he'd have a month to finish everything, and figured we could talk about it thursday. i really need him to take his cat though, she's heartbreaking to look at. misses him so much, not eating much. she's 20lbs, and loves food. he stopped for a change of clothes yesterday, and she sat in the kitchen watching the door for a while, waiting for him to return rather than eating her food that i just gave her. i try to show her extra love, but i can tell she misses him. and he probably misses her.

i've taken to writing a lot, either to other redditors that reached out to offer support, or just re-reading and replying to comments here. and writing in a private diary document. it's very therapeutic to write it out and be able to go back to re-read reasons for everything. for example, if i start thinking maybe i could have tried another ultimatum, i can just go back and re-read what happened the first time i gave one. or if i get to feeling i could have tried harder, i can go back and read all the things i did try over the past year. writing it out and talking to others really does help.

"by watching my neighbours fight while i was eating popcorn.. so i'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally i was watching the match on my living room little did i know there was another match going on my neighbours house. about ten minutes into my game, i started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.

between the game and the distance between us i really couldn't distinguish any words, so i just raised the volume of my tv and kept watching. during half time i got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so i lower the volume of the tv as i microwave some popcorn.

by this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as i take the popcorns out of the microwave i hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so i went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case i had to call the cops of something. now i have two dogs so i didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so i brought it with me.

so here i am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. for the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. by now i could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so i thought. suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as i gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.

now try to see this from their perspective. they've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. this got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.

""enjoying the show you \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!?""

i honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. they both flip the finger at me as walked inside ""can you believe this fucking guy!?"" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.

when i got inside i was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.

edit: i know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments i've gotten.  you all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! also shut out to all the cruz azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game i was watching!

edit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a and it probably isn't a dramatic one i'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.

tl;dr my neighbours were having a big fight while i was watching a soccer game, i went out to check while she slapped her husband as i was holding a big bag of popcorn. my nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again.",4

"x percent of y is equal to y percent of x. so, if you want to find out what 7% of 50 is, you could instead find out what 50% of 7 is, which is 3.5. this means that 7% of 50 is also equal to 3.5.. more examples: if you want to find out what 2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll get 0.4. so, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4. 

or, 12% of 25 can be alternatively written out as 25% of 12 instead, which would be  3.

"wife told me she wanted to experiment, i obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces.. throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. my (28m) wife (26f) and i have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. we had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. however, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". she has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. my wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". at first i thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. i had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days i obliged.

that next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. we were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. however, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. i was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but i agreed.

this is when things took an extreme turn. during this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. i had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""i want your shit"". i pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""i want you to shit on me"". i pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. i felt like a fucking dick because she thought i was kinkshaming her. in a way, i was because i thought the request was far too extreme. i ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

after that incident, my wife and i hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. at the end of the week, i asked my wife to talk about what happened. she told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. i thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. i couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

we fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, i tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. i told her that i will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. she was so happy and even though i was still completely nauseated by this desire, i wanted to satisfy her.

that brings us to tonight. we were having sex for the first time this week when i (regrettably) confessed to her that i had to take a shit. she perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. i still really didn't want to go through with it, but since i had promised her i pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

she got into the bathtub and i hung my ass over the side of the tub. i started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. i turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. with enough time, i was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. i could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. however, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, i felt a sensation around my asshole.

i turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. i was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

as i clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and i heard it land somewhere beneath me. i was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so i ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. as i was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how i will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, i heard footsteps approaching. my wife lightly knocked on the door. i didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more i thought about what just happened. she walked away and then i got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

i've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. we have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but i don't think i can look at her after what she did to me. i feel deceived and violated by the woman i love and trust. during our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. she knew how uncomfortable i was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

i would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. i'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, i cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and i. i know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

"by getting titfucked nsfw. so setting the scene, finished my last final, tired as shit. so, what do i do go to a bar. there i am chilling and this guy buys me a drink we chat and we hit it off hes really cool hes from my home town and we just really relate to each other really well.


fast forward and were fucked hardly holding our shit together, being somewhat responsible we leave and call an uber. we went to his apartment and chilled and watched netflix and whatnot until we made a bet on some weird shit. i dont remember what it was on but if he won he would get a titjob and if i won he would get graham crackers and icing from the store and we would make those graham cracker christmas houses, yes it was spring, yes we were wasted.


so the outcome had us in bed with me lying on my back holding my tits together and him on my chest thrusting between my tits. the liquor probably helped a lot but i thought it was hot as fuck. he starts moaning and groaning a whole lot more and i close my eyes and he cums on my face and chest. not a second later i hear a girl screeching. it scares the shot out of me so i scream and open my eyes and instantly get cum in my left eye. the guy starts laughing his ass off, his girlfriend/ wife starts crying while still screaming and i'm still laying down and i cant see shit. she runs out of the house and the guy grabs a pair of pants and runs after her. 


i dont really know what i was supposed to do so i just kind of took a shower and left. their shower was really nice though. it was really tall and open and kind of looked like the top of a lighthouse.


overall
guys looks: 8/10 nice beard

sex: 9.4/10 nice and steamy 

cum in eye: ß gritty?

shower: 10/10 really cool

"by flipping off my four year old neighbor.. i'm a salty fucker. i'll admit that from the jump. i can't stand the family that lives across the street because their kid is always fucking freaking out and screaming, slapping shit, having tantrums, throwing shit across the street and into my yard...you name it, he does it. i can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. he's a little fucking hellion. 

his hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when i get into my car and leave for work. i got so sick of being stared at by this little asshole, so i flipped him off and gave him a nasty look as i was getting into my car. he immediately started screaming and crying. as i drove off, i felt...weirdly satisfied. seriously, it was the most fulfilled i'd felt in weeks. so, i immediately did it again the next day, the next one after that, and the day after that. each time he'd start screaming and freaking out. it made me bitterly happy.

this morning, as i was getting ready to leave, i saw the demon child in the window again...giving me the stare...and i flipped him off. only this time i heard the bellow of ""hey fucker!"". the kid's fucking dad had been standing behind him and i didn't see him. i sprinted into my car just as he came running out of the house. i got in before he caught up with me, but that still didn't stop him from throwing a potted plant at my tail light.

i'm at my girlfriend's place right now; my roommate tells me that the fucking psycho has been to the house twice looking for me. kind of dreading going back; thinking that i'll just hang out here for the long weekend and hope it all blows over.

3) some might say this is a popular opinion. i'll tweak it: i should be allowed to slap people who bring children that talk / make a disturbance in the cinema.

"i (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. idk what to do anymore.. i'm posting because i cannot share this with my family and i can't talk to my friends either.

wife and i have been married for 4 years, together for 12. last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. my brother was my hero. he was there for me when my parents abandoned us. he was there for me when i struggled with depression. he's like a father figure to me. 

so my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. he told me that it was very important. we met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. he told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. and he also started suspecting it. i was really shocked by this revelation. because my wife never told me about this. and i never imagined she would cheat on me.

but when i confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. she didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. but my brother claims it was consensual. 

we ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. i just want to kill myself. my brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

i'm really torn. i don't think my brother is a rapist. but i'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. also, she never told me this. she had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. idk what to do now. i think i'm just leaving. but i want some advice to cope up.",8

a year ago she reached out to me on facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn't hate me for what happened and she hoped i was still clean.

"how do you repair relations with crows?. story is relevant.

my neighbourhood has a lot of crows. over twenty of them. they are generally on good terms with one another.

i watched them band together and kill one of the crows. they left its dead body in my yard. i waited until they cleared out and then went outside to clean it up because i don't want crow guts everywhere.

however, one crow was still in eyesight and cawed up a storm. this brought the other crows, and they all started swarming in the air. none of them dove at me but it was clear that they were upset with me doing this.

now, they congregate and caw aggressively any time i am outside. some swoop. they are becoming more and more aggressive.

confusion on why they'd be mad at me for cleaning up _their_ mess aside, how do i repair relations with these crows? i don't want to deal with being attacked every single day by multiple crows. 

google is not helpful on this front at all. there is surprisingly little documentation on how to make crows like you after you've cleaned up the corpse of one of their peers.


is it as simple as feeding them every day? something else? am i doomed?",7
"parents took $6000 from me without my consent. resulted in homelessness and prevented university education.. i live in alberta, canada. about a year and a half ago, my family got a huge surprise from my great grandfather, who gave us each $5000 with the exception of my mother. i was 17 at the time, and my mother and uncle went to the bank with me to set up a joint account between me and my uncle since my great grandfather wrote the cheques in both mine and his name for some reason.

my father, who was an alcoholic at the time, stated that it would be best that all of the bank cards of the newly created accounts be in his and my mothers hands so that we wouldnt make reckless purchases. at the time, i didnt mind since i was planning to save the money for university, but the main reason i gave the card to them was because my father was not one to cross. hes done things to me in the past, and ive been scared of him since.

all was fine until a couple months later when i decided to pitch into my savings with my job, only to find that the $5000 was gone through multiple purchases.

the tap function was on the card.

i confronted my mother immediately, away from my father, and she agreed to pay back $400 a month. however, this only happened for three months. around the same time this started, my great grandfather, unaware of what happened, sent another $5000. due to a plane ticket i bought to see my gf this august as well as a $500 slash to my paycheque, i was left with about $1000. however, after we transferred the money into my brothers account to keep my father as calm and stable as possible, his account was locked, my mother refusing to open the account.

i burst under the pressure, and was given the boot. while i was in the homeless shelter, i kept asking for the $1000 back to get shelter to find my mother already unlocked the account and gave it to my father. 

i had to drop my classes in high school right before the diplomas because of this. i was unable to get a credit card approved by the bank for application because of the ridiculous transactions, and found that my great grandfather was going to send another $10,000 before he learned of what my parents did. a couple months later, i was let back in, but now theyre telling me ""its gone, money is the root of all evil"". 

i lost my girlfriend after cancelling the trip, lost my university aspirations, and lost much more that id rather not reveal here. what should i do? 

update: after seeing all of the suggestions here and seeing just how many people apparently have my back, i decided to leave the house and go back to the youth shelter while i get myself a lawyer and gather the necessary evidence. thank you all, i never thought this would blow up like this when i went to sleep last night. knowing a couple thousand strangers have my back seems to give me more courage to go about with this action than i did before.

you see, i have about $650-700 in known debt right now, and they're asking me to pay $250 a month for a room even worse than the unfinished basement i was sleeping in before, and giving my mattress away, as i found out just now during the moving preparations. it's still $500 cheaper than the room i paid for per month after getting out of the shelter at my friend's place, but it doesn't feel right, especially with how they're consistently acting as if what they did was nothing. if you guys have any more advice, i'll be sure to take it and update you all with the situation.

"32m my wife 33f will not shut up, and i'm not sure i can take it that much longer. is it possible for that to be a reason to leave?. i'm not sure if i should have posted this on instead.  but here goes: my wife will not shut up.  i'm not talking about your usual chatty cathy.  i mean she (almost) literally will not. shut. up.  she will talk continuously from the moment she knows i am within earshot.  not just in the same room.  i mean as soon as it's reasonable to assume that i can hear her.  she will not *stop* talking until i'm gone, and sometimes not even then.  on more than one occasion, i've gone into the bathroom, turned on the loud exhaust fan, taken a leisurely dump, and then returned to hear her cheerfully engaged in the same ""conversation"" she was enjoying before i went in.  she also refuses to *use* the exhaust fan while she's in the restroom because it would prevent her from being heard.  so i get to hear all the bathroom noises on top of whatever homeric epic about her friend's cousin's girlfriend's hairdresser she's blathering on about.  
  
i once drove from tampa, fl to chicago, il with her (before we were married- i'm such an idiot!) without saying more than ten sentences.  she did not stop talking the entire way.  the entire way.  
  
television on to a show i like?  pfft.  that's not a problem.  she'll happily turn the volume down so it doesn't get in the way.  having sex?  that's the perfect time to tell me about how olivia newton john still has the leather pants she wore in grease and she- brace yourself- still fits in them!  really!  needless to say, we don't go to the movies.  ever.  i've been shushed out of too many theaters.   
  
i get it.  she grew up in a huge italian catholic family in the bronx.  if you don't talk loud and constantly, you don't get to talk at all.  i, on the other hand, grew up in a scandinavian family with two children.  to this day, i'm not sure we ever *had* a conversation in our house.  i actually often wonder if that's what made me attractive to her.  i was taught to politely listen to people and then wait for them to finish before replying.  she never finishes (or takes a breath it sometimes seems), so to her i'm paying rapt attention to her no matter how much she talks.  
  
that's not true, though.  another difference between people of swedish heritage is that we don't use ""filler"" words for acknowledgement.  other than the minnesotan ""naaaaah,"" (useful on every occasion!) we're pretty much silent when we listen to others.  no ""uh huh"" or ""yeah"" or ""omg!"" needed.  a nod of the head every ten minutes or so is all you need to convey your attentiveness.  i think it has a lot to with living in the frigid north.  you keep your mouth open as much as my wife does, and your teeth are going to shatter from the cold.    
  
to her, that's like being in the room with a dead person.  she's always stopping to ask ""are you even listening?"" or say ""you never pay attention to me!"" or even quiz me with ""what did i just say?""  i've become an expert at storing the last two to four words she says and parroting them back at her.  she'll be like ""blah blah blah ... and then she told him she wasn't taking that kind of crap anymore,"" and i'll go ""that kind of crap?"" as if i had any idea what kind of crap it was or who it was that wouldn't take it anymore.  and she'll say ""yeah!"" and think i've been paying attention the whole time.  
  
i joke about it a lot, but it's actually getting to the point where it's a problem.  our son is seven years old, and he has developed a pronounced stutter because she interrupts him constantly.  growing up in her house, if anyone paused even for a millisecond, that was grounds for talking over them.  and you talked loud so they didn't finish.  my son apparently inherited some of my less ""staccato"" speech patterns, and she basically just uses that to interrupt and take over the conversation.  it got so bad that he started automatically stopping and restarting words, even when not being interrupted.  i didn't know that was considered a stutter until we went to one of those parent/teacher night things, and a teacher listened to wife and then turned to me and said ""well at least now i know why josh has a stutter.""  just like that.  
  
she's failed at least one job interview because of this.  i know because i lined it up with a business acquaintance myself.  he called me up and said sorry, but he just couldn't take being in the same room with her because she wouldn't stop talking.  
  
we rarely are invited for a second ""couples date.""  she monopolizes the conversation every time we go out with other people.  who wants more than one does of that?  
  
you're probably wondering: ""well, have you *told* her about this?""  yes.  many times.  sometimes jokingly.  sometimes with utter seriousness.  the reactions vary from anger (talks louder, higher, faster, and uses lots more swear words) to tears (she's the only person i know who can carry on a totally unrelated conversation while sobbing hysterically).  the one thing that doesn't happen is her talking any less.  
  
i try not to let it get to me.  she's a very affectionate woman.  loves me to death.  mother of my child.  pretty as the day we met- prettier, even.  we still get plenty of ""alone time,"" (granted, she won't shut up while we're doing it, but i'm pretty busy so i don't really notice as much).  but it *does* get to me.  it's selfish and shows a lack of self awareness.  there's a time and a place for enthusiastic conversation, and they're not ""always"" and ""everywhere.""  
  
i know the answer to the problem: i have to ""talk back.""  in effect, the only thing that possibly *could* shut her up is for me to do the same thing as she does.  i would have to interrupt at the slightest pause.  i would have to talk louder- yelling if necessary- when she tries to interrupt me.  i would have to learn to use italian hand gestures to emphasize my points and chop off her objections.  but i'm not italian.  i'm a waspy pale dude who grew up in a household that would have made a mortuary sound like a middle school cafeteria.  
  
twelve years of this has finally pushed me to the brink.  i'm not sure i can take it that much longer.  i'm just not sure if i could get a word in to tell the judge why i'm there in his divorce court.  my wife wouldn't let me.  
  
tl;dr: wife will not shut up.  is that reasonable grounds for leaving her?  
  
edit: obligatory reddit ""omg i had no idea this would blow up.""  which is true.  i thought maybe a couple of people would just call me an asshole and that would be it.  but rip, inbox.  it was nice to know ya.  so in the interest of not replying to *every* comment, i will try to address some of the common ones and answer some of the questions i saw popping up multiple times.  
  
also thanks for the (often hilarious) advice.  
  
q1 - is this bs? (implied)  
a1 - no, it's all mostly true.  i admit to some embellishment for dramatic/comedic effect, though.  the bit about the leather pants is representative, not an actual quote.  not from sexy times, anyway.  she probably mentioned it at some point, though.  
  
q2 - why didn't you run away screaming *before* you got married?  (sub-question: was op's wife hot?)  
a2 - yes, she is hot.  and funny.  and vivacious.  also, i really *was* a ""nordic silent bear"" (thanks, /u/sarah_dragonfire), my wife drew me out of my shell.  and if i'm brutally honest with myself: when you're young and getting laid on the regular, a lot of things don't seem all that terrible.  damn you, penis!  this is all your fault!  
  
q3 - did your kid really develop a stutter because of this?  
a3 - medically speaking, i cannot state this with 100% certainty.  the cause was never formally diagnosed.  however, i watched it happen first hand.  i'm not a qualified speech therapist, but i think it was a reasonable conclusion to draw based on the observations i made.  i'd welcome a dissenting opinion from an actual professional though, if only to salve my conscience.  which leads to:  
  
q4 - aren't *you* really the one responsible for your kid's stutter?  after all, you did nothing to stop it.  
a4 - guilty.  and i feel utterly like shit about it all the time.  for the record, i did bring it up lots of times even to the point of getting into arguments about it and speaking harshly to my wife when she interrupted my son.  but i think by the time i realized it was happening most of the damage was done.  and anything i could do was more expressing my anger about it than actually making an effective change.  all the rest of this weirdly long post is just ranting.  if there's an actual justification for leaving, this is it (and i'm deathly afraid that she'll get full custody and just make it worse or even irreparable).    
  
q5 - is it because she's (pick one: ocd, insecure, autistic, mentally ill, ...)?  
a5 - i don't think so, although i've always sensed an overwhelming need for attention.  i see it in her family dynamic, in that all of her many siblings were in constant competition for their parents' attention and affection.  
  
q6 - have you tried counseling?  
a6 - no.  probably should have, but i know her well enough that even mentioning it would shatter her.  it's bizarre that i can't bring myself to do a lot of things people have suggested (and believe me, i've probably thought of all of them) because they just seem too cruel to me.  and yet, i'm seriously considering divorce.  i realize the contradiction there.

"il neighbor is using my paid parking spot (& has even gotten me towed). landlord hasn't done anything. i rent an apartment, and an assigned exterior parking space within my complex's parking lot is included in my rent. i have a parking pass that i display in my car, and documentation from my landlord stating that this specific spot belongs to me.

i have a neighbor that always parks in my spot. i have contacted my landlord every time this happens asking him to handle it, but nothing ever happens. i have also kept a log of every time i notice this neighbor in my spot & when i've contacted my landlord. (for what it's worth, neighbor does not have a visible parking pass on his car, and also puts a cone in my spot when he's gone to reserve it, so i don't think this is just confusion - i don't think he owns a spot at all).

this past weekend, said neighbor had my car towed from my spot. i confronted him in person, but all he did was claim that the spot was his. i once again contacted my landlord, who stated that this spot was indeed mine, i shouldn't have been towed, and he would speak with my neighbor to reiterate that it is my spot.

well, apparently neighbor didn't listen, because last night he was in my spot again. i called a towing company (same one that towed me) to have him towed last night, but they either didn't come or were talked out of it by him, because when i woke up this morning, his car was still there.

additional info that might be relevant: my complex is managed by an hoa, & my landlord always claims he'll ""notify them"" when i make a complaint about my neighbor. 

i'm growing incredibly frustrated with this situation, as i pay for this spot. with that being said, i'd appreciate advice on the following questions:

1. what can i do to stop my neighbor from using my spot?
2. what actions can i take to ensure my neighbor doesn't get me towed from a spot that i am authorized to use?

update edit: i just spoke with the hoa. they confirmed that the spot is mine & that this neighbor doesn't even have a parking spot at all. hoa also said he should've never been authorized to have my car towed, and are speaking with the towing company to ensure it won't happen again. finally, they provided me with a 24/7 emergency number that i can call to have my neighbor towed every time he is in my spot.

"an airbnb i recently stayed at had hidden cameras in the bedrooms, my friends and i were recorded having sex. anything i can do to have the footage deleted?. some friends and i met up in southern california to have a little weekend together since we all live in different parts of the country. i brought my girlfriend with me and so did a few of my friends. the weekend went how it went and on our last day there we noticed there were small hidden cameras speckled through the home. after checking the bedrooms we confirmed there were in fact 2-3 cameras in each room all pointed towards the beds. i contacted the hosts and they stated that its their home and legally they can have security cameras in the home. is there anything we can do to have the footage deleted or something? i understand the need for security cameras in case of damages or stolen items, but being pointed at the bed in all the rooms? it makes me feel really uneasy.

"if i told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?. so my situation is a little difficult so i thought i would confide in the good professional people of reddit. couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. we haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" i mentioned something along the lines that i smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (this was hard for me to tell because my whole life i was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) we both laughed about it saying ""just don't let mom find out"" the joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""i cheated on my wife..."" at first it didn't register until i saw his face and he was dead serious. i for one hate cheaters, but i try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. he begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. she would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. he told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. during this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. he told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. they've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (they have a kid) 
he told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

as stated before i hate cheaters and i've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. i know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. my heart tells me i have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because i've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. my brain tells me it's none of my business and i should keep my mouth shut. i don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. on one hand i betray my brother if i say something on the other hand i betray our close family friend because i know this secret and i don't say anything. i wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. so there it is, if i said something?

tldr: brother cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now i feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. wibta?

edit: i'm referring sil as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are very close lol. i thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just sil, but it looks like i was wrong.

i honestly cant believe what he did to me, even till now. it was so impulsive of him, he was never like this. regardless, im too disgusted by the thought of him right now. i consider myself to be a resilient person and can brush this off (the experience, not the problem itself), its just that im still shocked by what happened, and the fact that it did. ill reply to some of you as soon as im settled at my mom's.

original post:

my boyfriend and i have been dating for 7 months. we're currently living together (for the past 2 months, edited this part due to people misunderstanding), and we're an admittedly kinky couple, so ""abuse"" is part of our sex routine. we are always safe about what we do, and have a safe word and everything.

last night, he came home from the pub drunk at maybe 2am. i was busy the next day so i slept early and didn't wait for him to come back home. when he walked into our room, he slammed the door open, took off his clothes, and jumped on top of me. he said he wanted to  have sex, and i told him that im too tired to have sex, so he said fine and got up to go to the bathroom.

minutes later, i heard him come back into the room grunting (he's a relatively big guy). he climbed into our sheets fully naked, and started playing with my body. i was tired, but it felt nice so i didnt stop him. then he whispered in my ear ""wanna try anal?"" but i didnt hear him properly, so i just said ""sure, just make it quick."" he then tried to go in, with just his saliva. too dry for even the regular. when i felt it, i immediately told him to stop, and that he was going for the wrong hole. he didn't listen and continued anyway. he plunged himself deeper and it was extremely painful. i screamed our safe word (""b******n"") 5 times and he didn't respond. he just kept going while i was suffering. he covered my mouth to muffle my screaming, and the pain was so intense, i passed out.

when i woke up in the morning, he was gone, and when i got up, i saw blood on our sheets. i was really scared, so i canceled my plans and headed straight to the hospital in a maxipad. after going to the er and doing some tests, it turns out his forceful entrance caused a fissure in my anus. the doctor said i would have to use some medication and that, if the fissure hadn't healed in 4 or 5 weeks, i would have to get surgery.

i just got out of the hospital and am going back home soon. i haven't seen my boyfriend or spoken to him since yesterday. i dont know where he is (nor do i want to), and i honestly don't know how im going to deal with him. what do you think i should do? please help me deal with this.",8
"for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though i don't need it?. i hate flying to the point that i will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. it's not that i'm scared of flying, i just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

so i only fly if i can buy a second seat (or third if i'm flying with my wife). it lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class and for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. i'm a big guy but i 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

on multiple flights i've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no i bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? if i was willing to fly with one seat i wouldn't have bought a second seat.

note - i do not take two seats on the train/bus ever. they are way more comfortable and you can stand whenever etc so i don't feel cramped and trapped like on a plane.",3
"the phrase ""drugs and alcohol"" is harmful as it promotes the idea that alcohol is not a drug. alcohol is a mind altering drug that does not deserve any kind of special treatment or differentiation from other mind altering drugs. it isn't safer or otherwise more innocuous when compared to many other mind altering substances which are always discussed as being ""drugs"". by saying things like ""drugs and alcohol"", we give rise to the notion that alcohol is somehow in a different category, which i believe is harmful in a society where alcohol consumption leads to so many deaths. alcohol is a drug and should be discussed and treated as such without any special treatment.",6

"by chuckling away being overpaid.. obligatory ""this concluded today"" - i've been working for uncle sam for about 7 years now. i'm severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day i received a letter from dfas (the guys who actually pay us) that i was overpaid two whole cents.

silly i thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which i could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, the man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - it was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.

laughing it off i taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom i work for and why i should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you f-35), and forgot about it. a month later, two weeks ago i get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. ""we contacted you at address xxxxx, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.""

now i'm kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before i ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now i'm being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. being the class a humorous guy that i am, i send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying ""heer yore 2 cent, i kunted et al myself. i lobe me job."" covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.

this was a bad play because apparently feds have no sense of humor.

two weeks later, one week ago i got called into my officer's office. not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, i was sketched out but ""it does what its told"".

i'm standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. ""me, mind explaining to me why i received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?""

""uhh.. well sir, they spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so i thought i'd compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. patriotism, y'know sir?""

""well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - we need these floors clean for reason and were looking for a class a go-getter to clean them.

edit: i wrote this late. my wording shouldve been ""making a tweet instead of going to the police""

2nd edit: to clear things up a bit with a bit of context since a lot of people have taken this personally. ive seen a lot of people share their stories about their crappy experiences with cops but you guys at least tried which tells me that an actual crime happened. i'm talking about the people that don't even attempt to go to the cops and yet have no issue coming out on twitter and using their followers instead.
recently in the voice acting scene a popular va has been accused of sexual assault because he gets affectionate and hugs all his fans and sometimes pecks them on the cheek. hes now being fired from everything and some of his fellow vas are coming out saying that he sexually assaulted them too. they havent tried going to the police nor have they said anything other than the blanket term ""sexual assault"" which these days could be a hug. 
i've seen people say ""wow seeing this backlash i can see why its hard for women to come forward"" theres a big difference between going to the police and making a report and publicly going after someone that has a dedicated fan following. 
apparently this has been happening for years but no one got a restraining order against him and no one is getting specific on what it is they did. they're ""brave"" enough to use a blanket term but they don't have the balls to say whether it was rape,grope etc and then they wonder why so many people don't believe them.

when i confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. he then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. and when i explained to him that i had every right to be there because i had permission from the tenant to be there, he said ""okay, i'll let you go this time.""

people have the right to be a piece of shit outside of the work place. the punishment has no relation to the offense and its basically thought crime. its not any different than keying their car. it's cowardly and childish.

you don't know that person's situation or who depends on them. that person could be supporting children or a sick relative. and getting them fired will likely embitter them and reinforce their beliefs.

there are obvious exceptions if there's implications for public safety or what not, but otherwise, if somebody can compartmentalize their behavior and be a good employee i really could not careless about what they do on their free time.

"update my grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (f24) to marry him (26). i don't know what to do, since i don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).. hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my previous post. (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0fmrl/my_grandparents_dont_approve_of_my_relationship/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

it was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that i come clean to sam. i did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. i asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

his cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. he told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. they wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

he then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. he told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

well i think it's working. sam and i have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night i notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. sam and my grandpa are both ww2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with sam. 

i decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. i got there before sam, and i could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought i had come alone_. they asked where sam was, when he was coming etc. then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived. 

i'm just so incredibly happy that i get to keep both relationships.",8
"by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter. this just happened last week. i got home from working out of town thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. ""beth"" comes in and i can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. she feels fine though. 

i am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. i wake beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. it is more than half closed and a little red. she still feels fine. as soon as the doctor opens, i call them and they tell us to come in.  

we get there and i go to check in. the receptionist that i have never seen looks at my daughter and says ""oh. my goodness, what happened?""  so i respond as a joke ""eh, she got out of line"".   

i know!  it's horrible. i'm sorry!  i have a weird sense of humor and i'm a bit socially awkward.  anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  soon we are called in. the checkup goes as expected. it's a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter zyrtec or benadryl.  then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

he comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. the doctor is angry. we all head to the doctor's office to talk.  

there is a policeman and a policewoman. the policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. my daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  so she says no and buries her face in my side.  the police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. i saw one of beth's cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. the doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

the police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. the doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. he just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  i now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  she makes an excuse and leaves the room. he says that he thinks he has to let her go. he says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. he says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

the police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if i can come to the station.  a friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

we get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   the police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. they say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  i call my wife who goes ballistic.  

the county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if i sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. my uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. i stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that i really don't need to make for this week.  i can't wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but i'm pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.

thank you for the gold kind strangers.
wow this blew up.  i wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  i want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  for those of you saying that i am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) i will not be sleeping on the couch.  my wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  at least not at me.

2) i am heading home from boston tomorrow evening and i think everything should be resolved by then.

3) i will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  she was very young did not do this out of animosity. i do not know what if anything will happen to her job. i am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) the other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  a few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  these lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  the receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   the dep closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  it turned out to be nothing.",4

this morning, i was at the airport to head back to school. i look ahead in the security like an i see joel mckinnon miller aka detective scully from brooklyn nine-nine. my sister takes a picture of us and i'm on my way. while waiting for coffee i decide to post the picture on the subreddit. i get on my flight and it's at 100 or so upvotes. i land and i'm at 4k updates and have a whole slew of comments congratulating me for coming out. i go and look back at the title of the post and find out i said ""came out to him"" instead of ""came up to him."" i'm at 25.4k upvotes now and am still getting comments on people congratulating me for coming out...


also most of my swim team knows about the post and now i'm never living down the whole ""accidentally came out on the internet"" thing...

tl;dr- met a celebrity, ended up accidentally coming out to the entire internet

"update: i fucked up by not knowing the guy i like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass."". link to og post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

two months ago, i fucked up. i was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. i ended up realizing, not in a way that i wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab i work at. 

basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and i were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when i said, ""i would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" he overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. i was so fucking mortified. 

i didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. that didn't happen. on my first day back, i was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""oh fuck,"" i had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that i ought to apologize for my crass comment. but instead, i frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if i do that, he can't see me right? that didn't happen again. instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""hey my name, how was your break?"" 

i looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. he told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. he didn't bring up what happened either thank god. then he said something along the lines of, ""is that all your having for lunch?"" and i was like, ""uhm yeah, i was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

then he said, ""oh i was gonna go grab something to eat at a sandwich place near us, do you wanna come with?"" 

i was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. i tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so i said sure and we went. 

well. we ended up having a great lunch. inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""so tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think i spent staring at you?"" i literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""it has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? that has to mean i like you."" (btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

even with my shock, i managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

we have not done the butt stuff. he told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. looks like i will be retaining my butt virginity and i managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

tl;dr: despite my fuck up, it all worked out. we're celebrating one month together tomorrow! also, i'm a girl (got two comments asking if i was).

edit: yes, i accidentally wrote ""guess"" instead of ""guest."" my b, my b. ",4

"for yelling at my sister in law?. context here: i'm an ex heroin addict. the why and how isn't important, but i got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. i'm 26 now and completely clean. i don't even drink, except for on special occasions where i'll have two or three drinks at most.

now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before i had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that i'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. the first year or so, i understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. however, it's been almost six years since i was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that i'm gonna stay clean.

she's very vocal about these concerns, too. if i get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks i've relapsed again and i'm having withdrawals. she made a huge scene on christmas day two years ago because i had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that i must have been doing a ton of coke. if anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. i mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. 

i went away recently with some friends. on the first day of my trip, i dropped and broke my phone. because she and my brother were unable to get ahold of me for a few days, she became convinced i had gone on a massive dope bender, and began telling my family and friends that she knew this to be the case. when i got home, i found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. it was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and i sort of flipped at my sister in law. i yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that i'm incapable of staying clean. she got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but i said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. at that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. i'm being told left and right that i'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and i need to apologise, but i'm still upset that she evidently believes i'm incapable of doing this. aita?",3

"by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.. obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

i had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. i proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! or so i thought. 

about 3 weeks after our proposal, i notice she starts acting different. not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. she had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of m-f each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. i went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when i have work the next day, so i often opted out.

we would also share our google location with each other at all times. mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and i would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. i looked at her location one day and it was turned off. i texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. hadn't been a problem for the past year. she turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. she also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. i only had the location for the personal phone. eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

two days ago, about a month after the proposal, i decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and i just wanted to put it to rest. i used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. she had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. i called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. she said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

i waited until she got home and confronted her about it. she said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought i would get mad. turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. i kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time i asked.

the next day when i got home from work, i asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. she said she deleted them. so i said i wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. i started recovering the data from the last backup. she sat down beside me while i was doing it, and asked what i was doing. i told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! so she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. i asked her one last time, ""before i look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" she was silent. i asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. so that's a win i guess.

planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. havn't told her yet. still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. feels shitty but i'm keeping my head up.

tldr; by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. it has been one month since the proposal now.

my housemates are convinced our house is haunted. i don't get it. i've lived here for 273 years and not noticed anything strange.,0
"for suggesting that the reason my female friends dislike my housemate is because he's not sexually interested in them?. i (23m) live in a house share with 6 others. 2 other guys and 3 girls, we're all the same age.

now one of the housemates, we'll call cliff (23m). i call him cliff because he reminds me heavily of brad pitt's character in once upon a time in hollywood. cliff is a very good looking guy, he's friendly and pretty much the poster boy for ""strong silent type"". he doesn't talk much and is mysterious, but he's also very confident. 

the thing is, we don't see that much of him. but whenever we do, he's always bringing back a girl to the house. like a different girl each week. he occasionally comes to the parties we host in our house and whenever he's there, people gravitate to him. 

now the three girls i live with, when they first met him, they tried to make moves on him while we were out at a nightclub and he swerved away from them and went to other girls in the club and got with them instead.  since that day, these 3 girls have made catty remarks about him.

when we're in the kitchen (when cliff obviously isn't there), they'll talk about how rude cliff is, how annoying he is, etc. they were doing it yesterday so i just chimed in and said ""are you sure you're not mad at him because he basically rejected you all that one night?"" and they all got super defensive and claimed they never moved to him (they clearly did...i saw it clearly as did my other housemate) and then called me asshole.

i told cliff what they said and he just looked at me and laughed, and then said ""don't concern yourself with what they say. they're childish"". so i dunno...aita?",3

"by attempting suicide without realizing it. so, as i was making myself breakfast this morning, i for some reason started wondering what would happen if i touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. being the very intelligent man i am, i of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. i instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. a small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

the worst part is, i still didn't realize what i had actually just done. i just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. as i grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that i had almost electrocuted myself. maybe i was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. if i had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, i would have gotten an electric shock.

i haven't told anyone yet, and i don't think i will.

"by putting a 5 hour energy in my vagina. 12 hours before my first ""grown up job"" interview, i was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company's grounds. considering i smoke weed daily i started looking up ways to pass a drug test. i came to the conclusion that i was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. i had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they're just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. 

unfortunately i was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time i had to prepare, but knowing that i wouldn't be able to pass if the temperature wasn't correct i had the idea to stick it up my vagina. i tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so i could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.

fast forward to the interview.
it was an hour and a half away so i decided to wait till i got there to insert it. i did it in my car w some coconut oil before i walked in just incase they decided to drug test me first. i walked in and everything was fine, i signed in and they told me to take a seat. as soon as i sat down i knew something was wrong. i went to the bathroom to make sure i could still take it out. i began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn't move. i tugged again and the string broke. at this point i'm freaking out. i try getting it out with my fingers but i can't reach it. the only ""tools"" i have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. so in a 3 piece suit and heels, i squat and begin to use these ""tools"" to try and remove the bottle. about 4 min go by and i'm really freaking out but need to go back incase they called my name. i walk out and the hr rep sees me and asks if i'm okay. i tell her i have a tampon stuck up my vagina that i can't get out and that's why i'm freaking out. she then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, i ask her if i can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. obviously that didn't work. so she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... still didn't work. at this point i just have to do the interview. it lasted 3 hours and i had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. 

when the interview finally ends i rush to the closest urgent care where i have to explain to the doctors why there's a 5 hour energy in my vagina. at this point i'm convinced i just don't have the right tools and they'll get it out in no time. upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it's also sideways. her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle in my vagina and then fish it out. ~luckily~ they just sent me to the er instead. 

so now i'm at the er where they then inform me that since it's behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since i wasn't actually giving birth my body wasn't dilated and they couldn't remove the bottle without putting me under.  

well, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.
i didn't get the job and i didn't even get drug tested. 

tldr: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. after 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the er it was finally removed

edit: this isn't made up. idk if i have all the ""anatomy"" right i guess? yes it was very painful. yes, i have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don't believe me

"for inviting my atheist friends only for the wedding party and not the ceremony?. edit: didnt expect this to be a reason to be called a ""child molestator cultist"" but i suppose that's reddit for you?

i am getting married in a few months. we have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so i thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. my future wife and both of our families are roman catholic. catholic ceremonies are *long*. i'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual ""getting married"" part. if you are not a believer, it is boring af. hell, im catholic and i know i'll be bored for 80% of it. i thought i'll spare them the trouble.

anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying i forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. so i said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. she got confused, i explained and she got annoyed to say the least. said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. i tried to explain again & fix things but i felt guilty the whole time. 

was it an asshole move?


edit: ah, i suppose i am ta. just for clarification though: 
- we did explain things and they are coming to church. no hard feelings between us. 

- those who i decided to ""spare"" expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to christenings, first communions & confirmations) so i thought it translated to wedding ceremonies

- i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of ""they invited me so i have to"" and ended up going wrong about it :/",3

i called the police. that led to an argument with the people (at least 2 adults) occupying my house. they told the police they'd been there for 6 weeks. i explained i knew that to be untrue because i was only gone for 20 days. at the end, the officers said it's a civil matter and left.

the doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so i'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived. 

i spoke to the company and they've told me to get lost, saying it's private property and they're well within their rights to use jammers how they please. is that true? i'm struggling with the funeral costs as it is, i can't afford a lawyer, especially if it's going to go nowhere. ",2

i'm determined to move past this as soon as possible and onto better things, the things that i should have achieved had mia not wasted five years of my life. but there's an issue that has me on the fence: i was supposed to donate my kidney to mia's brother tom, and now i don't know if i should do it.

tom has esrd and needs a second kidney transplant as soon as possible because the kidney from his first transplant is failing. i'm not that close to him and i was only going to do it because i wanted to help mia's family in any way i could because i though they were going to be m family. but now that i know that she was just playing me the whole time, i'm having second thoughts. organ donation is a big deal, i will literally risk my life to give part of myself to someone, and at this point i don't want to do it for the brother of the girl who lied to me, used me and made me a fool for five years.

"i (f25) found out my fiance (m27) is with me for money/family business. to preface. my family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. thus i am a trustfund baby. i try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
i met my fiance mark when i was 20 and working as a waitress.

we began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

now mark is not poor. he is upper middle class. and while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. i thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. what i want to say is that i never had the impression that mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

in the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and i stood up for him and fought with my dad. they came to love and accept him. when mark graduated dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

sunday i was supossed to work in the evening and i was going to stay with my sister. but i got a fever and was basically just non functioning so i stayed home. instead of staying in our bedroom i made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (i didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so i just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

mark came home when i was fast asleep and i was woken up by loud voices in our garden. i pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark was there with a few friends. just as i wanted to say hello i noticed that they were talking about me.

his friend kept laughing and calling mark ""the man!"". then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and i am free"".

at this moment i felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. i kept hearing them calling me trust fund barbie and stupid and so on. i didn't know what to do so i just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. i texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

i haven't returned home and just told mark that i was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
my sister has been really worried but i just feel so ashamed about everything. my family was right mark is a gold digger and i fell for it. even if i tell my family what happened i have no proof. my father can't fire him just because he is a dick. as far as i know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him i think. i just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

edit : we are non us. mark wasnt talking about anything else. he has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it i helped pay it off. there is no way he wasn't talking about me

edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. i opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. we have called up dad and i will talk to him tommorow. i will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

"for firing an employee after his parents died?. i'm the vp of sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of april, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. he's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. his job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. he's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

we called him into a meeting on friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. i thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

i told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

"for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?. about two months ago, my husband and i got ""married"" in a beautiful ceremony. it was so much fun. we went on a honeymoon after. the price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it's their only daughter's wedding. as a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or i could afford! my husband and i paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

the wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. about a year and a half ago, i was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). i had recently graduated from school and didn't have health insurance. my husband and i decided to get married so i could join his health insurance. it was a quick justice of the peace ceremony. we were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. a few months after that, he ""proposed"" (something i didn't see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. we weren't trying to be deceptive. however, part of it was that i wasn't comfortable revealing my health issues. my husband respected this. my parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. his mom (i'll call her carol) and i aren't close. she's fine enough in low doses, but...

we're currently in the process of moving. this past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. as we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must've slipped out. carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. and then she noticed the date. 

carol lost it. she insisted we lied to everyone. she said our wedding ceremony was just a ""gift grab"" (our wedding website stated that someone's presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). carol went and called her twin sister, my husband's aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. she said we were sneaky and deceptive. she is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. 

for me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so i could get insurance. a means to an end. our wedding date is what we will celebrate. are we assholes for not being more upfront? i've been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. my husband insists we are not assholes.",3

"my (36m) wife (33f) was sued, i'm feeling resentment towards her and i don't know how to move past it.. fwiw this is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. no offense to reddit, but i'd rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but i'm okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

as the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. the money is a significant amount for us, we didn't have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

my currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger i'm feeling towards my wife. until now i've always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. but, since i'm the breadwinner i can't help but to feel like i'm spending ""my"" money on something that isn't my fault. i've had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. however, i have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where i know my wife is guilty. she has a part time job and doesn't make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

what did my wife do? (note: i had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

she used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of 'recruiter'. my wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but laura gave her a personal email address instead. my wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as laura at her company. these messages said derogatory things about laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make laura look bad. her manager got one of these messages that claimed that laura was a heavy drug user. laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass laura. well, laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. not only that, but laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. my wife didn't know this at this point, but laura was pregnant. several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on laura behalf. 


using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. she did some more internet sleuthing and found laura's husband on facebook. laura's husband didn't have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. my wife sent him an email claiming that laura was cheating on him. the husband confronted laura about this email and laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  my wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. what she didn't realize was laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. she also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


my wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. one of laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. my wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) she did not make herself known immediately. instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. she was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about laura - my wife was telling people that laura didn't actually know who the father was, among other things. this was at an event where her husband was at as well. the word got back around to laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


i'm leaving a fair amount of information out - my wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in laura circle and sent them messages about laura on multiple occasions. all the messages were trying to paint laura in an extremely derogatory light. all the events i've mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  my wife didn't think to mask her ip address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same ip address, ours. many of laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. they had ample evidence against her. all the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. she even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife's accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


i honestly felt awful for laura, there were lots of tears on her end. you could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. she said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. she was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. and that my wife's harassment continued even after laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


my wife has never done anything this crazy before. i knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. we've had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. but, she really fucked up this time. i don't know how to move forward. i know someone is going to suggest therapy, but i really want to start building up an emergency fund again. we're pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** wife was sued by her former best friend, i emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. i need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. what can we do to move forward?",8
"by finding my gf's porn videos and confronting her about it. this actually did happen today and i'm still kind of shaken up from my initial reaction.


basically me and my gf of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. we're both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. long distance is hard as fuck, so summer is a great time for us to fuck like catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. fortunately she's on the pill so we don't have to use condoms. great right? wrong.


last night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn't in the mood. i went home with blue balls, and decided that i was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. after going in and out of sleep, i eventually decided that i needed to get off, and ol' reliable would have to do.


i loaded up pornhub and started browsing through the videos until i found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. i got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. the girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. exactly like my girlfriend. i was thinking ""oh cool this is basically like jerking off to moving nudes"", and began to jack it.


but once the fucking started, my heart stopped. she had the same birthmark as my gf did, same spot below her ass, same shape and everything. this wasn't a look alike, this was my girlfriend. i grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.


i checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. i was hesitant, but clicked on it. turns out this wasn't a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen i was looking at page after page, video after video of my gf being railed by giant porn dicks. my girl wasn't as innocent as i thought. she was a porn starlet.


i was so fucking torn right then. so many feelings started running through my brain. it now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. she was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.


i then started freaking out about stds. none of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. we were both each other's firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now i was terrified i had been duped. not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. i realized that it was late enough that i couldn't do anything so i went to bed again.


i woke up the next morning in cold sweats. i was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. i sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book i could think of. i called up my doctor's office and scheduled an std test. fortunately they could take me right then so i drove over. 


after the tests were finished, i got a text from my girlfriend. ""what the fuck are you talking about???"". i was even angrier than before. that little bitch was gonna act dumb about it?  i was furious, but i had evidence. she wasn't gonna get out of this one without some explaining. 


i fired up pornhub again to find the videos, but i couldn't find the casting one i started on last night. no worries, i remember her stage name. i typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what i found. not because i was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren't there. they didn't exist.


now i was just fucking confused. i tried other porn websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. i knew i saw them last night tho, so i knew they were there though, right?


and that's when the realization hit. remember how i said i was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? it was all a dream. a very bad dream. my brain decided that a great dream to have would be my girlfriend being a pornstar, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.


so here i am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how i had a dream she was a pornstar without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names i called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could've turned out. fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so i think we're good for now.


tl;dr: had a very realistic dream that my gf was doing porn, gave myself a heartache, sent her a very angry text over nothing, and wasted my morning in a doctors office taking std tests for diseases i don't have.


edit: ok holy shit this blew up overnight. i can't reply to most of the comments/questions/concerns so i'll try to break it down by groups that i see most frequently commenting.


for everyone saying the relationship is done: surprisingly not. she took it pretty well and were talking this through pretty openly. i'm gonna go over later tonight in person just to make sure, but it hasn't gone nearly as bad as i thought it would.


for the conspiracy theorist: nah, the videos don't exist. she didn't pull them or anything, there were enough videos that on a normal ph page there would definitely be at least one re upload. i checked my browser history, nothing there, and nothing is ever deleted on the internet, and i trust my gf so i'm fine on that note.


for the ""yta"" crowd: yeah i know that's why this is on and not on wholesome stuff or smthn.


for the ""sex work is real work, you're just misogynistic"" crowd: sex work is a real job and i'm not contesting that. i also don't care if my partners body count is as long as troy polamalu's hair, or as short as oj simpsons prison sentence. what i got mad at was that she was currently banging dudes without my knowledge, breaching my trust of her, and crossing a deal breaker for me. obviously it never happened but that was what i was mad at, not anything else.


for everyone getting mad at me for not knowing how porn std tests work: thanks. now i know i guess?


also shout-out to the one guy who thinks it's fake solely bc he never heard of jacking off in bed before. can't find your comment but it gave me a good chuckle.",4
"by almost murdering my friend and stopping a school-wide arms race.. so this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. and just before sillybands took over as chief tween pimp currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed ""locker artillery"". basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. we would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and paper hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.

eventually, things got out of hand. it became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. heists were performed on teacher's desks. books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. students presented welts from paper hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. rubber bands were contraband. it was a full-on mad max magic school bus adventure.

here's where the fuckup started. one night, i was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: the secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. i needed something aerodynamic. so, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. ""i'll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?"" i thought to myself.

let me tell you.

the next day, i created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. with the inkwell loaded, i felt like a small, sexually frustrated macgyver with intent to kill. on the bus, my friend (let's call him neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. i obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). i aimed, pulled back and fired. all i saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before i heard an extremely sudden *crack*. i looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from neo's head.

my parents had to pay for the window. neo's parents didn't let me over to his house until senior year. the principal cracked down on locker artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. 

but i still won that arms race.

tl;dr: sixth grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. i upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. i was suspended and my friend's parents don't like me anymore.

"for not accommodating a vegan guest?. longtime lurker here. hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

so my wife (29f) and i (29m) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we've lived in our current city. we like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. we have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it's become a great tradition in our social circle. 

our friend james started dating his girlfriend sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that sarah was vegan. i thanked james for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. he agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. everything was fine, until now.

during our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. my wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn't push the issue. 

however, after the meal, james took us aside privately and told us that sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. he added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

my wife feels terrible that sarah was so upset and apologized to her and james profusely, but i don't agree that we did anything wrong. i like sarah very much as a person and i don't have anything against her dietary choices, but i don't believe it's fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. for the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. aita?",3
"by genuinely forgetting i had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in amsterdam and getting caught.. so this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

i would freely and happily admit if i tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

came with a couple of friends for the weekend to amsterdam for a birthday. it's a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

i'm sure most people know the dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit 'coffee shops' and buy and smoke joints. 

had a fun party night last night in town. went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

in a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, i put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...'did i ditch that joint'?

at this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

'sir, do you have anything in your pockets' says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

holy. fucking. shit. what to do? i'm still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. do i come clean? no way-too late for that. got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. but, schiphol airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. i'm asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. i'm sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did i smoke that joint??? airport guys hands pats pocket. i feel object being pressed into hip. fuck fuck fuck. 

'sir, empty your pocket please'? says airport guy. my partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. in slow motion i see the penny drop on his face. i dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. i feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

i'm dying inside. i say to pat down guy, 'oh god. i'm really sorry, i forgot that was in th...'
'haha, sure, sure - thats what they all say'! laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

i'm placed to one side. customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, 'don't worry sir! don't look so scared! you are 20th today and you won't be last! i'm sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately i can't let you leave amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home'. 

i almost wept with relief. i was made to sign a form to say he'd taken joint off me....and that was it...

i'm in a bar in schiphol airport in amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. to all you dutch-bless your hearts. you're the best. i'm sorry i was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

tldr i was a hot mess and genuinely forgot i had a joint in my pocket. got caught with it. dutch customs were amazing about it.

edit 2, thanks for the shiny stuff. first awards (on a story about my drug use).  i'm from uk for those asking.. my flights just landed and i made it through uk customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. i've just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. it says under what was taken, 'joints'.

"if you're working in a technical role (it, engineering, etc), write everything you do down as if it was a user manual. ignore those who say it will be used to replace you. it is far more likely to be used to show management ""you can give me that promotion, as the next guy is all set"".. it's also going to help build skills in communicating things clearly, precisely and in a way anybody can understand. you'll also be amazed how many times writing something out instructionally can lead you to think ""wait, why do we do it like that?!"" - identifying opportunities for improvement.

edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. for some extra help / elucidation:

-	i found this very helpful when i was starting my career. the biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out ""on paper"" to better see where things need to change, where i didn't know all i could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	i am indeed now a director. our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. it's those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; i can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. as a manager, it's a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. i'm never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it's because they've found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	most importantly, where i'm from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they've been forced to ""work themselves out of a job"" then they can sue for constructive dismissal. i know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it's not a common motif. as such, i do agree that if you're in a country like india, china, usa, where some of these protections and freedoms aren't so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. in others, like germany, uk, most of scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

but yes, as with anything - this has been an experience i've personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation. i guess as a second tip - if you're working for a company where you feel the management are always trying to find ways to screw you over, maybe it's time to find a new company to work for...",9

"update girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. i don't. what are my rights? (texas). this is my first post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

short version: i'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

long version:

if you remember, i asked about how i should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. i listened to the suggestions. got a lawyer. put myself on the registry as well.

she really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. i was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. but in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. so we had no messy legal right over it.

the childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. my lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

so i have my baby daughter!

taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. i feel like i have something to live for! my family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. i also got a promotion at work. i realized that i need to be more ambitious because i now have a baby to provide for. a higher position was open at my work and i asked for the promotion but they told me i'm too young. i offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that i can do it. after a month they gave me the job! 

as most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), i had my lawyer file for child support after i had full custody. my ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. she actually called me names and various insults and all of that. but i didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. she said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. i don't know. i didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but i think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. i didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, i'm not good at studying) but i want to make sure my daughter has the chance! my sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and i think i'll send most of the child support payments there once i start receiving them.

"my (24f) co-worker (50f) blamed me for my miscarriage but is now frustrated i won't talk to her. exactly what the title says. my coworker/'friend' has been in a sour mood because i was given 'lenient' clock in clock out times the week of my miscarriage ( i took no days off, and only came in and left early the first two days as the cramps were horrible) finally, after she was being talked to about coming in late she came after me, yelling at me asking me why i'm not in trouble as well and how it is not fair she is getting yelled at but i'm coming and going 'as i please'.


me, thinking we were friends, confided to her that i had a miscarriage. her response? 'i told you you were pregnant! why the hell are you here? you need to be home! this is why you had the miscarriage! you don't care about yourself, you're being selfish working when you should be letting your body recover. what is wrong with you? you are being so stupid! you don't take care of yourself and then you wonder why you had a miscarriage. come on, really. who do you think you're telling this to? i'm a woman! i have gone through things like this! don't look surprised if you find you can't get pregnant after this. honestly, take care of yourself. '


and then with that she announced she was going on break and i sobbed in the bathroom. i pulled myself together and didn't speak to her the rest of the day. then it was the weekend then she was sick and was gone and then she had a family emergency and has been back but i've moved desks. i'm hurt and angry and honestly, am not her friend. today she tried to send me a birthday gift and i refused. she is pissed and doesn't understand my change in attitude. she also tried to coordinate breaks with me. i, of course, insisted that i break at a different time. 

this is making her frustrated and i am honestly at a loss for words on how to explain to her why i no longer want to engage socially with her. i am completely amicable to her professionally otherwise. how do i explain to her i don't want to be friends with her anymore? is there a way i can do it without causing her to 'explode'?

tldr: worker got upset for getting yelled for being late to work, tried to come up to me and asked me why i didn't get in trouble, i explained that i miscarried my pregnancy and she blamed me for overworking myself and causing the miscarriage and that i shouldn't be surprised if i can't get pregnant again. now, after not acknowledging me for a couple of weeks she came to my desk with a bday gift acting like nothing ever happened and is upset i didn't accept the gift or want to have lunch together

update: first, thanks for the support. i didn't expect this to blow up like it did. yes, we are getting through it and doing okay. 


second, she ended up submitting a false report saying i interrupted her work day and withheld important information. it is false. i have witnesses, i was never alone with her, she had no details on what was held nor did she have any proof and when asked to clarify, she couldn't think of anything. i will update the rest tomorrow as now that she put a complaint on me (and it is very plainly false) it's gotten a lot crazier.",8
"for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking?. throwaway account.  we were at a local restaurant last saturday evening. this is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. there was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  there was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. a beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. there was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

but as i watched i noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who i assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. in fact, i'd guess the 4th girl consumed most of the mom's margarita. i mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. full disclosure that i'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. so i mentioned it to the hostess. a short time later a manager (i assume) came and asked to see the girls' id's. the girl with her own drink produced one. the second girl who had been drinking from mom's drink did not.  i did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. i assume they were asked to do so. 

my husband said that it was a crappy thing for me to do. i feel like i was protecting the restaurant. was i the asshole?",3

"reddit not covering the sri lanka bombings the same way it covered the new zealand shootings is dirty politics.. the 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few muslims. they carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

evil is evil. stop blocking breaking news.






edit: i would like to clarify. 
i am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-christian, or anti/pro islam.

i am simply stating that this act of violence as well as all other tragedies should get equal coverage, i had to go deep into reddit to find any news and its appalling. 200+ people lost their lives, and it didn't get the same attention as notre dame or new zealand massacres. 

i don't think they get the same coverage because of a fear of triggering a particular group, in this case muslims. it could have been extremist christians and i would say the same thing about them.

"if i don't donate all or even part of my inheritance (about $725,000)? my cousin say's it's ""blood money"" and claims she's donating 100% of her share.. using a throwaway since money is involved here. lots of background and doing my best to keep it under 3000 words. 

i was born in south africa but emigrated when i was just a few months old so i am totally american. i come from a family of full on apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for america. my parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. they made a small fortune in south africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. to be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the us, but still the money because they were white and well connected in south africa. 

my grandmother died recently. she lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in socal so i figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe i'd get some family heirlooms. my head about popped off when i saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). money that will literally change my life. 

my parents business failed so i wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. she's also now married, lives in rancho santa fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. she claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in south africa. she is seriously chiding me that *if* i plan on keeping it, then i am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. 

i have student loans i could pay off, i could actually have a down payment on a house, i could invest, i mean...i know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. i understand where it came from but i also can't possibly imagine giving it away. i have no idea what charities are like in south africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and i'm better off just keeping it. 

i understand my cousins point but man is it hard to say goodbye to that much money that will change my life.",3

"by breathing with one nostril my whole life.. so let me give some context on how this happened, a while ago i tried out an e-cig my friend has and he made fun of how smoke only goes out of one of my nostrils,i didn't think much of it , i thought its just a stuffed nose.

so i try to clean my nose and its already not stuffed but yet again i didn't put much thought into it.
yesterday i noticed that my right nostril is blocked again and my nose isn't stuffed, so i go look in the mirror to see that my right nostril is completely blocked by my septum.

i took a doctor appointment the next morning and as soon as he looked in he said i have septum deviation caused by breaking my nose at some point in my life when i was a kid and that it needed surgery.
i cant believe i've went for god knows how many years without realizing i wasn't breathing correctly and thinking that this was the norm.
surgery is within 24hours so yeah, this escalated quickly.

"update: i 24f am dating a 25m almost unreasonably picky eater and i'm pretty much at the end of my rope. previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3ev1n/i_24f_am_dating_a_25m_an_almost_unreasonably/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

this happened last night.

&#x200b;

this update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than i had hoped but it is what it is. i read what you all wrote and i appreciate all the comments left for me. despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that i'm not being nit picky about this issue. 

i decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. he needed help and so long as i saw that he was trying that was all i asked for. we were out to dinner (i'm sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his ""streak going."" i was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but i figured now was as good a time as any: 

me: maybe you don't have to continue to the streak. maybe you can just try new german cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

j: no way. i have people depending on me to continue this streak. i don't want to let them down.

me: i don't think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, i'm worried about you. this is really unhealthy and it's consuming your life. you're about to go on this incredible trip to germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. i think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

we had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. he doesn't think it's a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he's only 25) and how i was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. i let him know how this is my business because it affects me. we can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

we let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. the plan after was to go back to his place where i would spend the night. the entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while i wished i had just gone home. i should have gone home. i guess i didn't expect the shitstorm that waited when i got to his place.

he flipped.

he began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how i couldn't control what he did or ate. i told him i cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. i ultimately agreed that he was right, i couldn't control what he did or what he ate, but he can't expect that i stick around and watch and enable him like i had been doing in the past. 

it escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when i was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. i could not and still cannot dispute that. he was. i guess the only difference between him and i is that i wanted to change. i acknowledged the issue and knew i could not go on like this any longer. obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. one spirals much faster than the other so i was able to recognize it much quicker. 

i told him i was going to leave because i couldn't deal with this anymore. we kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would ""expose"" me. he has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. he would be sharing it on facebook. i completely panicked. i cried and begged that he didn't use my most vulnerable moments against me. he told me if i walked out he absolutely would. 

that was all i needed to hear. he was going to blackmail me. i think this snapped me awake to realize this isn't love. if i leave he's going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

so i left. i don't have many possessions there but he can keep them for all i care. he emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was ""last chance.""

let him post it. fuck it. i can't control other people i can only control myself and how i react. i deactivated all my social media and i'm ready to move on with my life. it hurts that somebody i trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it's a learning lesson. thank you all for reading.

"for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?. my sister is 16 and heavily overweight. she's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. she's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! i'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the edm and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely hated it all. the other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

as a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago i decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. for breakfast i made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. i make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. i mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. i have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

it was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. she started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where i told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (she thinks apple pie is healthy???) my mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but i really think i was making an honest effort to help? i feel bad for yelling at my mom but i dunno, was i really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**edit:** i really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. i just want to emphasize that i'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, i just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. i will try to be more self-informed in the future. i've taken note of her possibly having arfid, thyroid problems, or pcos and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, i feel bad that i've made such a horrible impression of her. she has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, i made a comment on this post detailing how i did the cheese sauce and stuff. thank you very much for your suggestions, i really appreciate them.

**edit 2**: my mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. according to the doctor my sister is at risk for type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.",3

so, we had the talk. my relationship is over. after some awkwardness, and a couple glasses of wine late saturday, i brought it up. she again tried to deflect and change the subject, but i demanded we stay on topic. i told her outright how i felt, how i thought this was disrespectful and dishonest on her part, etc. she tried to play it off like i was being immature and this wasn't a big deal. then she spun it into a penis size issue. i kept trying to tell her that the bigger problem is using a dildo molded from her ex-bf and not the fact that it was bigger than me, but she kept going with the accusations. i told her i wouldn't have had an issue if she wanted a big toy and i was down for anything, but it feels she has a weird, emotional connection to this dildo.

the conversation then took an uglier turn as she was outright say i have a small penis, premature ejaculation issues, etc. i knew there wasn't any way this was going to get settled in an adult manner, so i outright told her the relationship was over.

thanks for the overwhelmingly supportive comments in my original post. they were helpful and confirmed my feelings. now i guess i will have to deal with the humiliation of my ex telling people why we broke up. i'm sure she will spin it as a size issue.

"by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door. throwaway account because obviously.

my boyfriend and i are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. we got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. we're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. i started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so i figured on going to completion. unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

so there i am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. his mom comes in! i freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

anyways, it's 5:40am, i've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

tl;dr: bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

update @7:31am - thanks for all the reassuring comments. my bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. more to come.

update @8:38am - of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... anyways thanks! so breakfast started off totally fine. i mean, yeah i was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. that is, until i excused myself to go shower. she stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. but then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". it was sweet and cringy all at once. i guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

update: a lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. actually i assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); i didn't actually see her do it. i asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while i was...ehm...cleaning.",4
"a bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer. a bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. this means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually one teacher and one drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. i think it is.

furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. for those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

ps: i am not defending drug dealing, i am just comparing it to teachers.

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

edit: im saved!! well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. he works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won't be until 5 or 6 am. right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. this post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

edit2: wow this blew up fast. i see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. i never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. i wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. i'm extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. as long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

a lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. i worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

a lot of people were recommending joining the military. i've considered the navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)


((edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo. im very glad that there are many nice people here on reddit, but i would much rather you keep your money or use it for someone who needs it more than me. my situation isnt that bad. and again, thanks to everyone for all the advice",7

"found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens. this has been going on for several years. i live in a small rural neighborhood with an hoa where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. as with most hoas, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. there will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. it really annoys my husband. i just laugh at it

well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. there were a lot of emails sent about this. a lot of drama. i don't remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

so then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. some people thought it could be deer eating them. there were several theories. the next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. this year it started happening again and people flipped out. all caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

it started out being funny because i'm not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. but this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

so anyway, you already know what happens. i walk down to the bottom of our property that i don't visit often and i find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

i went inside and told my husband jokingly ""i think we're being framed for the onion heist!"" he got this really weird look on his face and i had the realization and asked him if he didn't have anything to do with this

he confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. he was sneaking out at night to do this. i asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

i don't even know. this makes me really uncomfortable. the man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and i didn't even notice? why wouldn't he just tell me? like this has been going on for three years it's not like he just did it once as a prank

i don't know what to do. can anyone help me think this through. maybe i'm overreacting but i'm pretty upset

"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪!!",6

"update: i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. &#x200b;

link to original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

i've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. i've also read through a lot of the comments. thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. there's been a lot of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. it's whatever at this point.

we had been texting off and on all evening. as promised, i agreed not to bring it up in person. when i got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. i was a little nervous not knowing what i might be walking into, but overall i just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. when i walked in it was clear so did she. her sister was helping her pack up her things. i didn't know what to say, but i never expected this. i honestly thought everything was going to be okay when i got home. her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

i walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. she didn't say anything either. she didn't even look at me. if she was going to leave i at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. everything i had read in the comments about buying a bidet and ocd lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than i had considered. i started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""you put this online? i told you to not talk about it!"" her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. she then accused me of cheating. what? this whole thing has been crazy and i feel like i had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. i snapped.

i told her sister i had never cheated. not once. i would never cheat on her. enough was enough, so i told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier i had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. everything went silent. like, no one said a word. out of nowhere they both start crying. her sister stared yelling at me and told me i shouldn't be talking about things i don't understand. when i asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that i need to mind my own business.

1. her sister knows about it. (she did not know i posted on reddit about it)
2. her sister thinks it's normal.
3. i need to mind my own business? they're my socks!

i stood there all kinds of messed up so i just left. i went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. i also called off work today. i went home and all her stuff is gone. i didn't text her back. i think i'm done.

to clarify a few things: she insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. she told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. she reaffirmed it's not a fetish. she won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. i can't keep up with the comments. i'm pooped. (i'm trying to find humor in this because i'm really upset :(

so yeah.

"(update to) i 32m was going to propose to my girlfriend 30f until she told me she's pregnant. i was thinking i'd edit the original post, but i decided i'd rather spend the night focused on my fiance than on reddit. since the original post really blew up i don't think too many people would see an edit, so i'm making a new post instead.

i took my lunch break early to be with my girlfriend at the obgyn visit. the iud was removed without any problems (it had shifted around which likely caused it to fail), and the pregnancy is not ectopic. however, a miscarriage is more likely, and if the baby is carried to term, there's a higher chance for complications and defects. it's far from a guarantee but it's a lot more risky than if it was any other birth control method that failed. i ended up taking the rest of the afternoon off so we could talk through everything together. eventually we decided we should get out of the house so we put some leftovers in my lunch bag and went to the park.

normally there is nothing special about eating day-old hoagies in a park, but it really helped us relax. we sat on a blanket at the spot we first met and talked about a lot of things. eventually the sun began to set and i decided it was time. i started to say i had been planning to do this for awhile and it wasn't because she was pregnant but she started tearing up and cut me off. she told me she understood so i skipped the rest of my fluff and asked her to marry me. she said yes, and we spent the next few minutes crying, hugging, and kissing. after we got our emotions under control she told me she'd seen my post (i knew she used reddit but i didn't realize she lurked here) and had been expecting it all evening. she said she would have preferred i proposed at our anniversary dinner (can't argue with that) but this was still about as lovely as she could have hoped for.

although the shadow of a potentially stormy pregnancy is looming above us, i am still very happy and feel lucky to be with her. we're going to visit our parents this weekend to break the news and get through the mountain of questions they're sure to have. we're not thinking about a wedding ceremony yet, but we'll definitely be getting our marriage ~~license~~  certificate (thanks for pointing out the difference) in the next few months like someone suggested.

these past few days have been a roller coaster of emotion. thanks for helping me get over my worries.

"for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?. dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but i'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

we've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. this year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and i jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. we learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, i adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

none of this has been a problem for me until recently. she saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then i rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. she exploded in anger (teen years, i'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, i know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was her pan for vegan food. i was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not your pan. 

she asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. i didn't want her to feel weird about food, so i said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. the reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that i'm not to touch them unless i'm cooking vegan. 

that wasn't good enough. now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because i eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. i don't mean i literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because i wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly i'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. my wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. my daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick. now i'm sorry for her, but i feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because i'm not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",3

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r12hs/pa_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and_threatens_to


my post was not hugely popular, but i have a small update. thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, i read all of them, even the ones i didn't reply to immediately.

i called the police last night. an officer came out to my house, he read the messages, saw the photos, and said, ""yeah that's illegal and i don't think it gets much easier to prosecute than this."" he had my fiance send him screenshots of everything and then the photos separately. he took my ex's information, our information, and the surprisingly ample amount of information i have on his girlfriend. 

my ex is currently on both probation and parole, so the officer is reaching out to his po today for a current address since he refused to provide it to me. he'll be calling my ex today, and if he hangs up on him or gets smart, he'll be prepared with an address to just go talk to him. he also knows where he is working this evening while the officer is on duty, so that is a last resort.

he is also going to run the evidence and our statements by the da's office today and get the green light to proceed with charges, which apparently will include an actual arrest once everything that needs to happen happens. i'm not clear on the details exactly, i just know that they are almost certainly going to be charging him with a misdemeanor 2. 

additionally, i am almost positive that my ex's current girlfriend, who he has been with for roughly 9 months now, was involved in some manner. she is an rn, so if it comes to light that she was complicit, she could also be charged and lose her job. i don't know how it would impact her license as an rn, but i did work for the hospital she works for currently, and any charges, no matter how minor, result in termination. the officer confirmed this, as well. 

and i took everyone's advice - i contacted my attorney. he is drafting a cease and desist letter to send to both my ex and his current partner. he is also going to request a copy of the police report to add to the already massive stack of evidence of reasons why he should not get custody of either of his kids, he should remain strictly on visitation, if he's lucky enough to even get that.

thank you everyone, i have a small amount of hope that this will work out favorably. my current partner doesn't care what he has to say or what pictures he sends, he sees it every day. he also knows that my ex is vindictive and is grasping at straws in an adult temper tantrum. hopefully this will end the years of this crap from my ex, as this is not the first partner he has done this with. it's just finally a charge in pa!",2

"for allowing the girls on my hs track team (i'm the new head coach) wear bikini tops and cut off shorts for a fund raising car wash?;. this is very fresh, posting from my phone and a throwaway because i'm honestly nervous about how big this is going to get. i just got an email from the assistant superintendent of the entire district that i have to be in his office monday morning and i'm scared shitless. 

basically i just graduated college and got my teaching certificate last year. the school heeded a track coach of the program would fold so i volunteered even though district guidelines (not rules) specify that a certain number of years is required before taking a head coach position but the principal waived this. we have some very talented girls and i enjoy it. 

we were scheduled to do a car wash fund raiser this morning. on monday one of the girls asked me if they could wear bikini tops and cut off shorts. they argued it was for thier comfort since it's about 80 here today. i was a little nervous but agreed. apparently word got out on social media and we had a line of cars 30 minutes before we even started. i'm so naive i thought initially people were just being charitable but when i saw boys from surrounding schools i knew somthing was up. and it wasn't long before older men started taking notice and we had a line where it was taking an hour to get a car washed. the girls themselves loved it, they all had fun, nothing bad happened (thank god) and all are proud of themselves for how much we made. 

parents are furious with me and obviously it's gone up the chain. i'm hoping to god i can chalk this up to my inexperience and i'm not fired buf when i had a 6'4"" dad screaming in my face that he's going to get my fired...i'm scared.

"marriage between 2 people isn't ""unnatural"" or ""outdated,"" people just don't want to accept the fact that all relationships take hard work, commitment, and sacrifice.. you've probably heard the statistic that half of all marriages in the u.s. end in divorce. you've probably also read or even argued that it's because marriage between 2 people is ""outdated"" or ""unnatural"" and humans aren't supposed to tie themselves to just 1 person.

  
this is just an excuse we've given ourselves to be lazy and selfish about our commitments. the reason marriages and relationships fail so often now is people think they'll find their ""soulmate"" - and once they find this perfect, special soulmate, they'll get married and live happily ever after like some sort of disney fairytale. what a joke. but this is really ingrained in our culture. think hard and take an honest look, and you'll probably realize it's ingrained in you, too.

&#x200b;

the fact is, marriage - even marriages between extremely good and compatible people - take hard work. they take commitment. they take sacrifice, honesty, and humility.

what does it mean to put work and sacrifice into your marriage?

\*it means... not scrolling through the facebook or ig pages of your ex-lovers or old crushes. saying ""no"" to silly thoughts like ""if i was with this other guy/girl....things would be perfect.""

\*it means... not giving yourself excuses to step out on your wife or husband. ""she/he was mean to me."" ""i deserve this."" ""she doesnt love me anyway. i can sleep with someone else now."" - nope. you made a commitment. stick by it and work on your issues.

\*it means... putting down the video games, the tv controller, the football game, the beer bottle, etc. and instead doing something nice for your spouse, such as the dishes or cleaning out the car. 

\*it means... not using your intimate knowledge of the other person to inflict pain and harm on them during arguments, but instead holding back and learning to express your frustration in a healthy way that doesnt cause severe damage to the relationship.

&#x200b;

•	cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	there is not one single state in the united states where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in america, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


for example, the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was $175,900.

according to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

a gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in june 2014, when adjusted for inflation. the actual national average price, as of july 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

the median household income in 1998 was $38,885. the most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

this did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

millennials truly have it harder than our parents did.

•	we cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

and yet, boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. that we're lazy and entitled. 

no, we're not. the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

for years now, when boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

we learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. so now we just say, ""ok boomer"".

"for ditching my date and causing a scene?. i'm 19f and my date was 25m, i was a regular client of a buddy of his who is a tattoo artist and he had seen me get tattooed by him once as he came to visit while i was half way through my session. 

i get an ig message from him, found it a bit odd as to how he would've found me since my page is super private, my username isn't specific at all to my real name and i have 40 followers. 
he explains he's so and so's friend and we end up speaking and have great banter, we seem to really get along through text, it's hard for me to keep up a consistent convo through text so i'm excited and we plan to meet up. 

we catch up to hang out and he offers me a drag from his spliff, i take a few drags and after a little while can tell it was a mistake. i smoke semi regularly but it hit me very differently this time around. we're in his car driving around and he proceeds to ask me questions and we talk.

i study justice so he's telling me how he's an ex con and is out on parole yet still engages in illegal activities, then goes on about how women lie about s*xual assault 99% of the time, that's when i freak. he makes a comment about how high i am then jokes about robbing me and leaving me in a ditch, at this point i start to get really scared.
he keeps asking if anyone knows i'm with him, who i live with, how much money i make & how much i have on me etc. just weird questions. i was under the influence (big mistake) so my reaction imo was much more extreme. i was scared and wanted to jump out of the car, the undertone of the convo was very off. my perception was exacerbated by drugs but safe to say i was genuinely scared.

i hid my unease and tried to convince him to pull over somewhere so i could be around people and also so he wasn't dui, he didn't want to and kept driving but after 20 mins of convincing him that i felt sick and needed to sit down, we pulled up to a restaurant.

i get out of the car and start walking ahead of him up to the restaurant as he's taking a phone call. i go up to 3 women and say as to not cause a scene ""i'm really scared, can you help me and pretend to know me"" they catch on and can see i'm upset. i sit with them, he catches up with me after his call and the women start telling him they know me and my mum wants me home, he says he'll take me home but they are very firm. he addresses me quite angrily and asks ""who does your mum think your with?"" the owner gets aware and told him to leave and he ended up leaving. 

i felt guilty since i had gotten along with him and he'd taken the time to see me, i'm not 100% sure if i was in danger and if i could've stuck through it and left amicably instead of unintentionally causing a bit of a scene which was embarrassing not only for him but also me. i tried to have tact in the situation and didn't have the confidence to be straight forward but wonder if in hindsight it would've been better to tell him i was uncomfortable and wanted to leave.

edit: some of you are saying this is a validation post or would be better suited to other subreddits, i'm super new to reddit but thought that most predicaments are pretty much fair game for this subreddit? correct me if i'm wrong please. i genuinely wanted to to know if my reaction was rude, if there's something wrong with me for getting freaked out the way i did and if i'm the ahole for handling a bad date this way. i see that this isn't as polarising as some other posts but unlike on here irl i had very mixed and negative reactions. hence why i got on here and despite all that, i do appreciate the support and validation (ngl) from people saying i did the right thing even though it didn't necessarily feel like that in the moment.",3
"for pointing out that my co-worker is trans/doesn't pass?. alright.

i'm a european woman in her mid-twenties who recently moved to san francisco for a fancy-pants internship. it was a huge culture shock, but in a way, a welcome one- i'm gay (the very girly type people don't really clock as gay, but still) and this is the first time i've ever been out at work.

there is one co-worker who we shall call linda. she's a trans woman (mtf).

linda's position means that me and she and i don't really interact at work often. therefore, i was told about her before i met her. one of my co-workers told me that she existed, i was due to meet her next week, and that she was a trans woman who uses she/her pronouns. i met linda, didn't even ask for her pronouns and just used she/her, everything went alright, i thought that was the end of it.

now, linda does not pass as a cis woman.  she's still a woman and i'd never misgender her, but it is objectively visible that this is probably a trans woman, not a cis one.

this now caused an issue. a few of us had a halloween get-together and invited linda. at some point, she and i were alone at our table. we got talking about what it was like for me being this very girly gay woman in a male-dominated field in a conservative european country. at some point, i made a remark along the lines of 'but of course, you as a trans woman probably faced similar experiences'.

her face just fell. she started hissing at me about how dare i presume she's trans, she hasn't been misgendered (i did not misgender her, at no point did i use 'he' or anything like that- i just said she was trans, which...she is) in years, and no one at work has ever had to ask for her pronouns etc. drunk idiot i was, i blurted out 'but...we all know?' which we do.

i was extremely confused. apparently, out of the younger group of co-workers, no one ever actually asked her for her pronouns or gender identity because we all, just like me, got told by some colleague who'd been there longer that this was a trans woman who uses female pronouns. this somehow led linda to believe that we didn't 'clock' her, which was a huge source of self-esteem for her.

linda now, and i say this without a hint of exaggeration, hates my guts. she confided to another coworker that she's extremely hurt by me pointing out that she doesn't pass and that it was invasive and rude and how dare i judge her. i, on the other hand, don't really know what the hell happened here. she is trans, that is a fact of life, everyone knows and it is clearly visible.

"every year my wife has spent upwards of $1500 on new xmas decorations she just throws away after new years. she promised me last year was the last but i just found a huge bag of decorations in the garage. i'm disgusted. what do i do here? (both 34, two kids). wife and i have been married 10 years, we have two kids 5 and 3. wife is a good person but has no concept of money, budgeting and spending. i've gotten her following a pretty decent budget but she comes and blows her was during xmas. 

i don't mind her being generous to friends and family. it brings her joy and i appreciate that. but what disgusts me is her ""need"" to spend money to decorate. every single year she goes completely overboard and essentially buys an entire brand new set of christmas decorations. everything from tree holders to candle stands to ornaments. every year it's all brand new and every year she's so exhausted by the end of the holiday to store and organize it all that she just throws it all away.

to best exemplify how it works let's talk about stockings. she will go to target, see cute stockings buy four of them. then she'll go to world market and see even cuter stockings and she'll buy four of them there. then she'll see one at walmart which features lighting mcqueen for my son and buy it and buy one for my daughter to be fair. so we'll have 10 new stockings for xmas and all of them will be thrown in the garbage on january 2nd. the rub is my grandma hand made stockings for the entire family, so we don't even need any, let alone 10. replace stockings with any other xmas item and that's how it goes until we have $1500 at least in credit card bills for stuff that's just going in the garbage.

last year we couldn't afford it all so we ended up paying interest until about april on her xmas purchases. i told her enough was enough and frankly i'm also sick of the amount of junk that were just sending to the land fill. we went over all the decorations we already have and how we could just use those. she agreed.

however i was getting ready for work (i work extra saturday shifts in novmeber and december to afford the holidays, another post i guess) and found two huge bags of all brand new xmas decorations hidden in the garage. i would guess it's $300-$500 worth of stuff. i'm so disgusted i can hardly see straight. 

i'm up at 4:30 on a saturday to work my ass off for stuff that were going to pay interest on that is going to give us 20 minutes of joy that will rot in the landfill. i feel exhausted and just want to get into bed and tell her to go work. 

what do i do here? sitting in my truck really fighting the urge to go grab the kids and move into my moms house until we get to some resolution here.

let's see... her problem is that she overspends, exhausts herself, runs out of spoons, and tosses the decor rather than go through the huge and delicate storage game. hey! you live there too. you get to enjoy her cooking, her decorating, her throwing parties for your friends and your family, she does the family gift shopping, sends out the cards, plans the parties, cleans up after the parties... and you? you bitch because at the end of all this emotional and physical and executive work, she's too fucking tired to carry in and organize all the deco boxes, carefully wrap each ornament, nestle it into another tissue cradle she makes, carry out the full boxes and find somewhere to put them where your untended crap overflows the shelves and leaves her with the job of reorganizing the entire place to jenga everything together. but you'll sit on your butt and bitch without lifting a hand. hey, i've got an idea, mr. man. get on your tiny snowflake feet and put the fucking decorations away. then there they are, next year. her? she's fucking tired after bringing you, the children and everyone else a nice holiday. or ask for a bouncy seat this christmas, so that you can watch her struggle while laying back and sucking on a bottle.",8

the office of foreign interests at the swiss embassy were very helpful although they didn't do anything until i had the documents proving that i'm a us citizen. i was able to exit iran by going on a vacation with my family to turkey and i just did not come back with them. the foreign interests office arranged everything so that i could go to the us consulate in istanbul, they were already in the loop and were aware of my case, i had a quick interview and picked up my travel documents. my brother bought a ticket for me to fly to the us directly from istanbul. i had a difficult time getting through airport immigration and had to answer questions for over an hour but in the end everything was fine.

i feel so horrible. i cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. we've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now i don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. i've been getting texts like ""wtf"" and ""what the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so i think he's told them what happened.

so for context a normal saturday is for my wife and i to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

this week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

so off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our saturdays.

as we are about to leave her sister says ""have fun"" in a cheeky way which i completely don't pick up on.

my brain decides that as my wife and i spent thursday together for valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

so straight after the ""have fun"" and without consulting my wife, i say ""you can tag along if you like""

the atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and i'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so i double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""as you said it will be fun"".

my wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when i've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

i've apologised and explained. i know we will laugh about it later but for now i'm playing lego lotr on my own.

tldr: my family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

i think rm is crazy and needs a mh checkup. seriously. i am very worried for her wellbeing. 

my mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. i told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. my mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

when my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. i've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
my mom called rm and rd and r to come over to talk. they came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. she made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and i could tell this was pissing rm off. some points of the confrontation:

1. why are you calling my daughter these names?
rm: i didn't say anything. she's making        up lies. 

2. why are you even in the apartment that much? you told us that you go there once a month to check on r. you also said she visits you every weekend?
rm: the kids don't know how to cook, so i help. also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. why are you going through my daughter's stuff? why does she need a lock? why are you limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*i shall also mention that roommate's dad was sitting in their car on the driveway during this whole confrontation*

but things got heated up really quickly. rm started insulting my parents:

- she said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said i am unruly and that the clothes i wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). this annoyed my brother, and he showed rm ig pictures of r wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. rm shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- she then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""god complexes"". this pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" this pushed rm off the edge, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted to slap him. 

this lady tried to slap my 24 y/o brother in front of my parents. 

they argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. this time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. she came back to where we were standing and literally threw the dress in my face.

my mom had no more patience left, and back slapped rm across her face. i've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and i burst out laughing. even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of rm. rm started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

when they left we had a big discussion:

my parents were angry that i never told them about this before. they said that they got me that apartment so i could do what i wanted. they wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
however, they are very proud and happy with the way i dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. thank you all for the advice. i appreciate it alot. ❤

they were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of r cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

my parents agreed that letting r live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. my parent's started the eviction process today. 

anyways, it may be hard to believe, but i do stand up for myself a lot. it's just that in this situation, i didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because i had respect for their friendship and i didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. i learned from this, and i have growing up to do, but now that i know i have support, i won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

i also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't indian). no one is living rent free in this situation. 

i would also like to say that even though i wasn't friends with r in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

also my parents are liberal ass indians. they have lived here in america for over 40 years. they didn't want to spy on me at all. they don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

edit 1: i forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, i don't think it does. i'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. also, it's my parent's money. they'll do what they want. this gives me no excuse to have a gpa less than a 4.0, js. 

edit 2: i took out the part where rm tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  it was funny though. 

edit 3: i added a tldr. 

i included most of the important points. if something doesn't make sense i'll reply in the comments.

"acne can actually make a person more attractive.. i have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive. however, in my experience, for certain people it honestly kinda of fits well. have you ever met a person who you couldn't imagine without glasses? i'm convinced for certain people its the same with acne. to clarify, i am not talking about severe cystic acne. painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it. but people who have some minor scarring/breakouts it can really add to the character of their faces. this kind of laid back, natural, hippie kinda look. i can't really put my finger on it. it would be almost boring if you saw them with immaculate skin. and even though its already a golden rule, if they have confidence with their skin its even a bigger bonus.

edit: 

well this has never happened before. it's been kind of hilarious to read these comments going from: ""you're an absolutely disgusting vile human being"" to ""i 100% agree with you"". i'm also surprised at how unpopular this opinion really is! but i guess i put it in the right place lol. i'm not sure people should be thanking me either. i can be quite shallow as well. this is just one those subjective quirks i really enjoy and thought needed to be pointed out. but really if you read the comments some of the things you guys are into is pretty unconventional. beyond all these superficial traits though, i think the biggest thing to remember is that sometimes love just happens to you. you don't get to choose it. so stop worrying about who you're gonna pick. and as a the great redditor u/chief_economist once said: sit down, be humble. or was that kendrick lamar? anyway.",6
"if a women hits a man, he has every right to hit her back.. i don't agree with the saying that a ""man should never lay his hands on a woman"" and that women are the weaker gender as justification. a man is shamed for ""getting beaten up by a girl"" and for hitting a girl. i think this covertly sexist mentality normalizes violence against men and empowers abusive female partners. if a woman hits a man, he has every right to hit her back or take the high road if he prefers but should not feel obligated to do so. 

edit: i absolutely do not condone violence against anyone and i find the comments advocating for violence against women appalling to say the least. i'm just annoyed by the double standards when it comes to physical assault and fighting back. also, i don't believe it's mainly due to the size difference as some people claim. would you say the same thing if the attacker was swapped by a similar-sized male or does it become fair game then?",6

"(update) i (28m) with fiance (27f) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous ex was the best lover she ever had. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/

it all came to a head last night.  she just came out and asked me if i did not love her anymore and all that i could tell her was that a very large part of me still did but that what she said had really made it so that another part of me just didn't anymore.  

this started a larger conversation that i won't bore you with but ultimately it came down to me saying that i would have heard that he was just better at something or more attentive to something or was able to do something that i would have felt like i could have worked on it.  i would have listened to anything she wanted worked on any technique or anything else that she would have shared with me.  but to know that i was never going to measure up simply because of a physical issue was not something i thought i could get over any time soon or if i ever could for that matter.

i was even honest and said that if it was just a ons she had or some random guy who was just huge i might be able to get past that.  but knowing that it was a guy who she was still madly in love with when i met her and only after time did she ever start to come around then it was just more than i could handle.

she kept trying to tell me how much better i was at everything else and that i should not throw away a lifetime over one aspect.  i told her that that one aspect sadly was just to high for me, not all things are equal and that honestly it is a mental failing on my part that it is but whether it is genetics or a learned trait or whatever that yes i needed to be my spouses best and she has already made it clear that i can never be.

i tried my best to be gentle, i tried to take all of the blame of stating that i knew that my attitude was probably not healthy but it was who i am.  

btw i'm typing this as though this were a clean conversation, it wasn't, there was lots of crying (by both of us).

this is not a happy ending or even a satisfying one.  i am beyond fucked up in the head over the entire situation.  everybody's christmas is ruined.  we had big family gatherings that we both were attending together and now we have to somehow break it to our family's what has happened.  

this alone is causing me massive stress because my parents loved her and what in the hell am i going to say is the reason why we are not together?  she didn't cheat and if i say that i felt like she was still hung up on her ex she will obviously deny it and she will tell them the truth.  it's fucked up no matter how this goes down.

in the end i feel like a massive failure.  i feel like a failure as a man because of not living up to comparison and i feel like a failure because i wasn't able to just ""man up"" and either get over it.

she has begged me to go to couples counseling and initially i said no because at the end of the day what does it change?  we can talk about every single thing and i can try and look at things from a different way and at the end of the day the woman who i wanted to marry just told one of our friends that no matter what i do i will never be as good as her ex.  i just can not see five years from now ever being okay with this.  

but because she legitimately seems heartbroken i agreed to go.  but that does  not mean i will keep going.  

today i moved out a lot of my stuff and am staying with a co worker for a few days until i can get a place for myself.  she has been with her sister all day.  

i feel like shit.  

thank you to everyone who took the time to type out a response.  i honestly have tried to read everything even if i didn't reply to very many.

the bitch of all of this is that i still love her.  there is so much of me right now that wants to pick up the phone and call her and beg her to come back.

edit:  well once again i posted this and then went away for awhile.  i went with my friend to see mortal engines and the to dinner and then we've been talking for a long while so i started reading awhile ago.  it is going to take me forever to read and once again i don't think responding individually will ever happen because of the large number of posts and private messages.  but thank all of you for reading and responding.

edit 2:  i guess i do want to share one thing i spoke with her about.  when we were having our very long conversation i presented her with a scenario for her to compare.  i know her well enough to know that comparing body parts or sexual prowess isn't going to impact her the same way it would me.  so i put the scenario to her like this.  i said what if you walked in and overheard me talking with my friend tim and you heard this.  ""jill is great but she will never understand me and comfort me the way tiffany did""  ""but its not jill's fault tiffany is just the smartest most compassionate person i've ever known and jill just isn't as smart"".  then if she would confront me about saying those things about her that my response to her would have been.  ""i love you for all of your other qualities"".  ""nobody makes a sandwich like you do and i think long term you wont gauge me for my money""
at first she tried to say that this was a totally different issue but once we talked more about it she finally agreed it is because of the way we both approach and value sex.   she ultimately admitted that this would really hurt her feelings but she would not break up with me over it.  i then responded that even in my make believe scenario, which btw i would never say to anyone out loud about anyone i loved, she could improve her level of education and learn to be more compassionate.   
edit 3:  if anyone even reads this i want to add one last thing.  people have been telling me what a whiny bitch i am (that's one of the more kind things they've said) because i can't get over someone else in the world having a bigger dick than me.  not going to lie and say i'm thrilled with it but i'm not dumb enough to think i have a giant magic wand or anything.  i had grown up believing what i now know to be a lie that women don't care about size.  some don't but obviously some do and my ex is one of those that obviously did.  but even with that ultimately i might have been able to get over it if it was just said as a matter of fact.  but hearing that no matter what i did, how much i loved her or any other thing that i was never going to be as good is what has bothered me since.  yes size is obviously a big part of it, but if i hadn't heard that i would never be the lover i think i might have been okay.  well not okay but at least not relationship killing.  yes i overvalue sex.  i get that.  yes it is very important to me and well frankly i want to be wanted as much as i want to want someone, if that makes any sense.  yes i know whoever i date in the future will most likely have had someone who was either bigger, better or whatever.  but i would really hope that they would not be still hung up on it a few years later.

(new york)

a lot has happened over the last ten days.

i realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  i cannot live like this anymore.  and i mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

i was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that i was completely prepared to just stop living because i was too scared to find help.  so i went and found help.  

i took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, i found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  i've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

when i finally went back to work, i took the head of the fun committee aside and talked to her.  i explained to her that i have ptsd and some very severe anxiety issues and i apologized for not being more clear to her when i asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

and she cried.  she wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought i was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

then, i spoke to my manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where i can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  it is literally all i have ever wanted.

so, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  apparently.

"whether 18 or 40, women who have sexual relationships with 13 year olds need to be immediately hunted down by the law and put in 20 years prison, just like when its men doing the same thing.. https://preview.redd.it/zapcm4pe97c21.jpg?width=426&auto=webp&s=5da2b71aa1fd7350e23e933a19a84b7133b96a68

the double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/em28yfrmdfi?t=9

here's a youtube video of snl making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

there's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and ei is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is leagues apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. it would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

neither is acceptable. the double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is males who are underdeveloped for that age period. if there were a progressive victim stack, males should be ahead of females on the list because of the developmental delay.

edit: jfc this blew up. 

#edit 2: omg thanks for the gold guys, i really appreciate it! omg i also got gilding! thank you stranger. i am so blessed. i love you!

edit 3: google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". i dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. claiming i'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually worse because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

"update - ontario - people are living in our just built town home claiming they are renting but will leave for only ""$15k"". police are not being helpful, what am i supposed to do here?. i posted this last weekend.  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c0f7ep/ontario\_people\_are\_living\_in\_our\_just\_built\_town/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c0f7ep/ontario_people_are_living_in_our_just_built_town/)

on top of all that it seems they tried to seemingly destroy everything in our house. all the new appliances that came with our house are basically ruined, all toilets, and bathtubs seemingly look like they have been smashed with a hammer. in some places it looks like someone tried to rip the fucking wiring out of our walls, etc. basically our house i guess basically as a final fuck you to us.

our lawyer has basically told us the odds of us getting anything of value out of them is basically nil. i wanted them to go to jail for breaking and entering but apparently it doesn't work like that.

"my wife (25f) let her idiot friend (28f) negligently discharge one of my (30m)rifles. i'm angry with both of them and my wife is acting like i'm being unreasonable. advice?. obviously, i keep some guns. just for hunting and sport shooting.

i've got four rifles right now and i keep them locked in a safe in my barn.

before we got together two years ago, my wife had never really been around guns and at first wasn't too interested. after some time (and me explaining my philosophy on why i like to hunt), she has started to express an interest in learning to hunt for herself.

so over the last couple months i have been showing her how to handle and shoot a hunting rifle. taking her to the range, doing some dry practice at home, etc. she's been learning a lot and doing a great job. and she has been very careful to follow proper safety on her firearms which makes me a little madder about the situation this morning.

she had a friend come over this morning. i already don't have a high opinion of this friend. i think she is kind of an idiot, but she's also got that unfortunate personality trait where she tends to be way overconfident and think she knows everything about any given subject. i've gotten into a few mild arguments with her over it. but she's at least harmless so i never worried about her too much.

so this friend came over today. i figured the ladies would just chill out or something and i kinda found my way outside to work on my car, mostly so i didn't get sucked into a conversation with the friend.

at some point i saw them leave the house and head to the barn, but i didn't think much of it. half an hour later i heard a gunshot from inside the barn.

i freaked a little and ran into the barn. i found my wife and her friend, her friend holding one of my rifles, and they were both looking at me like they realized they really messed up.

in the immediate moment, after i saw the ladies were okay, i took my rifle out of friends hands and was mostly concerned with where the round had gone, luckily it just landed in the dirt a few yards away.

so with all that sorted, i wound up heading back inside and took my rifle back inside and got it put back away, and then with the immediate concern gone, i started to get mad.

i'm not necessarily proud of the language i used, but i'll try and portray it accurately since i am asking you alls opinions.

i asked the girls ""why. the. *fuck*. was one of my guns pulled out?""

friend didn't say anything at all, but my wife started explaining that friends husband wants to take her hunting sometime, so she was showing her a little bit about how to use a rifle.

so then i asked why it was loaded. i *know* i clear my guns before they go back in the safe, so i know there wasn't a round in there. and i keep my ammo in a whole different safe then the guns, which incidentally, was opened.

wife explained again she was showing friend how to load it. friend loaded it successfully, obviously, looked down the barrel, and ""accidentally"" pulled the trigger, according to my wife.

they were making a ""woops!"" face that kind ignorant upset me more. and it didn't help matters when my wife's friend started telling me that ""every rifle she is used to"" has a different kind of safety mechanism and-i don't know, i stopped listening to her there and told her it was probably best that she leave.

i locked up my guns and ammo, collected the keys from my wife and went back outside for a smoke. friend takes off shortly after that and my wife approaches me.

she approached me and just said ""sorry"". i was still mad so i told her something like ""yeah...'sorry' isn't quite going to cut it here.""

and then i asked her what she was thinking, because she *knows* better than this. i know she knows better because i taught her!

i told her she made a string of very bad decisions that started with opening the gun safe, handing one of my rifles to someone who very obviously doesn't know how to handle it, then opening the ammo safe, *letting her load a fucking round* and then letting her swing it around!""

my wife started getting defensive. she told me i've taken her shooting on our property before. the effect was the same here, right.

i told her, yeah, we've gone and shot empty bottles and stuff, but we got out into the woods and do it in front of a hill that we know works as a backstop. we *dont* just load a gun and fire wherever!""

wife told me that she *did* make sure her friend pointed in a safe direction at least, meaning out the door towards the ground. and i got a little mad again and said something along the lines of ""yeah, and it's a good fucking thing you did or else one of us would probably be in a police car by now!""

my wife finally said it was just an accident and i didn't have to make such a deal over it, i told her that this was an accident that *would* have killed someone if her luck had been slightly less.

she walked away and as she did i said something to her like ""do not go in the gun safe again without asking me."" she got re-pissed at that and asked why i'm treating her like i'm her ""dad"". i told her that those guns are registered to me and i don't want to go to jail if she hands it to someone who doesn't need to have it.

and thats where we've been all day. we're kind of just avoiding each other. that sort of argument is very uncharacteristic of my wife. she is generally a very responsible and level-headed woman and she is also pretty good about taking responsibility when she makes a mistake. this is the only real shouting-argument we've had and it really bothers me that she's throwing blame on me instead of recognizing how serious this mistake was.

like if she had at least admitted that she made a serious mistake i probably would not have added that bit about staying out of my gun safe.

i *do* for myself feel bad for cussing at her, because i never do that. and what she said about me acting like her dad hit a nerve to. so i'll probably apologize for the cussing here once i'm a little less angry.

so what should i do to handle this now? first big argument, and my wife seems to want to downplay how big of a deal this is. i don't want to talk down to her, but i do, really want her to acknowledge what a bad decision(s) she made or i'm not sure i'll be able to trust her handling one of my guns again. there is also the matter of her friend. like i said, my wife is normally a very responsible and mature woman, but when she gets around her friend it's like she gets......stupider, for lack of a better term. that is something that has bothered me about her friend before, but i've never said anything because it wasn't that big of a deal before.

how should i approach this? how do i get my wife to stop avoiding me right now for one, and how can i get her to recognize the seriousness here without her feeling like i'm trying to be her dad?

"i m26 recently found out my ""step-father"" m48 who just married my mother 2 years ago is currently having a sexual relationship with my wife of 4 years f28 behind my back and has been since late summer or maybe even before that. what am i supposed to do? should i tell my mother?. i'm sorry if this is a little much. i've been sitting in my car for a few hours, sorry for errors im on mobile. 

my wife and i have been married for 4 years. we argue sometimes over little things but i love her with all my heart. there's never been anything wrong until now. i thought we were happy, i always treated her right and got listened to her. i took her out whenever she wanted and studied with her. she doesn't work because she's getting her degree right now, so i gladly pay for everything and work overtime constantly because i wanted her to be great. she goes to classes nearly full-time and spends the rest of her time home or her school library. 

i'm not close to my mother at all but i see her from time to time. recently we've been trying to reconnect but she's just really not a good person. she was horrible to me growing up but i tried to forgive her for her personality and actions. she has alot of bad habits and had 2 failed marriages with really shitty dudes. she recently got remarried to another man 2 years ago, let's call him x. my mother invites me and my wife and it's the first time they all meet. probably 4th time i've met him since they married fairly quickly. he seemed.. okay. just really didn't like his vibe too much. but i gave him the benefit of the doubt because at the end of the day it's her life, not mine and we aren't close.

last year, x asks for help remodeling my mother's house for the day. my wife suggests we stay for the week and make it a bonding thing, i agreed. i thought we could all do things together but we ended up breaking into little teams. x and my wife really hit it off and i'm not very good with construction/renovation related things i ended up going out with my mother a few times to eat in an attempt to bond with her. it was weird but we tried. my wife stayed behind and helped x remodel. her family is really involved in the construction/engineering world so she knew much more than i about how to help fix the house up.  they seemed to really be close that week aka sharing jokes and laughing alot when i wasn't around and super animated conversations but i didn't think much of it because i assumed she was just being nice to my new ""step father."" i trusted my wife. 

she started going back over to my mother's house to help x out afterwards. they live almost an hour away so it's out if the way. i noticed when she'd be coming home way later than normal and decide to take the train instead of me pick her up. she kept saying library at first before she admitted to going there to help renovate since i wasn't ""much help"" in terms of helping my mom fix up the place. it was like once or twice a week. this started happening early this year. when the house was finished late spring, they kept hanging out which i didn't mind. i guess that makes me stupid. when her classes ended in summer we stopped spending as much time together but she made nothing seem wrong. she seemed happy, our sex life was the same, we were trying for a baby, everything was good even communication. i tried to go with her to my mom's place but she was usually with her friends when she wasn't home and i didn't really like x's humor/mannerisms. i didn't mind, i worked alot and liked to be alone sometimes. 

a few weeks ago she got home late again and went to shower. i always joked that she'd use up all the cities water with how long she showered. she was in there a bit, probably 1am when her phone pings and vibrates. it does this like 4-5 times in a few minutes. i didn't wanna invade her privacy but that's very abnormal. i tapped her screen to see what it was and i recognized the number. it was x's. he sent multiple mms messages with his face and nude pics of himself. there were replies from her with nude photos that were recent. just alot of words i haven't processed yet. i took an extended screenshot of it, took a few minutes, and mailed it to myself and put the message on unread so she wouldn't know i saw. i really wish i didn't. i really would have honestly just not have known and kept everything perfect. there are months of texts, blocks of text and photos and heart emojis, i took a few days off work the following morning and flew down to see an old friend lives in the midwest. he's hooking me up with a month to month studio no questions asked since we dont talk much anymore. she doesn't know i'm leaving in jan which is when our lease is up. i told her it was a trip for work and she just smiled and told me to have fun and she'd miss me. i came back and she didn't seem any different. our anniversary is the day before christmas eve.  i haven't told my mother, not sure how or if i want to. i haven't told anyone except you, reddit. i want to get out of here and be alone and think. 
 

it's been a while but i still haven't had the heart to go through all of the texts and photos. i feel like reading it all would make it all worse for me. i already feel broken and empty. i left my friends behind for her and started a life with her. i thought she was happy. we have been trying to get pregnant slightly before and around the time i found out and were supposed to go check in with the docs after the holidays. i need some time to think and i need to know how to fix this with my wife? how do i tell my mother? i love my wife with everything she's all i have i gave her everything these last 4+ years. i cant just  divorce, im not going to follow in my mothers footsteps. 

i know it all seems outrageous given he's married to my mother but i don't have anyone else to talk to. i was supposed to be home 5 hours ago but i don't think i can lay next to her anymore. i've been forcing myself to try and get over it and hope it just goes away and it makes me feel more and more disgusted with myself. i'm probably gonna sleep in my car tonight. she's already called me 3 times and i'm just exhausted emotionally. it hurts ignoring her calls. i'll try to check back for any answers later tomorrow if i have the time. im sorry if this post was a waste of your time but i hope you have advice.

"by making everyone in the elevator think that they were going to die.. alright, so this is an old story, but when i found this sub, i had to share.

when i used to be a muslim, i had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

i was on holiday the day of the fuckup. i got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the paris attacks. there were roughly six people in it. then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. for those who don't know, the adhaan starts with allahu akbar. when that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. i had to explain to them that i wasn't a terrorist. then everyone just started laughing.

i understand that everyone may think this isn't a fuckup, but i feel like i shouldn't have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the paris attacks.

tl;dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks i'm about to blow up the elevator.

and one gripe, a large amount of negative comments,  in most of them the person commenting doesn't seem to understand the full magnitude of the incident and why it provoked that response, please take the effort to fucking understand what i wrote first :)

and to all the haters who are send messages to me calling this story fake, i really don't care if you think my story is real or not. i'm not here to argue  about whether this actually happened.",4
"for not being attracted to my girlfriend's body?. i made an alt account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
i'm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so i'll try to keep it as pg as i can.

so, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. we have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
i will say that she's the first thin person i've ever been with. she's flat, petite and pretty short. most of the girls i've been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and i've always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
this all started when me and my girlfriend were watching netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if i was okay with her having a flat chest. (she's always been insecure about not having b**bs.) i asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that i never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. that kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she's not attractive if she doesn't have a certain figure.) she said she was just curious.
i told her i had to be honest, and said that i'm not attracted to her chest size, and that i actually prefer bigger b-bs. it's not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. if i'm being honest, that's why i usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
she was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. she texted me later on that night and told me what i said hurt her a little. she said we've been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like i lied to her. i told her i didn't know what to tell her, and that i was just being honest (i was.).

am i being the asshole here?

"nc my dog went missing a month ago and i found her on facebook. the family that has her refuses to return her to me. what can i do?. so a little over a month ago my purebred yellow lab went missing from my backyard. at first i thought she might have escaped but after looking around it turned out someone broke into my backyard and took her. i made a police report but nothing ever came of it and she didn't turn up anywhere.

last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. it was my dog. i should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

i called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. i told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation i all but confirmed it. here's the problem, when i asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because i took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". i told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

i found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. i found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. she is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

i'm pissed right now and don't know what to do. that dog lived with me for over 5 years since she was a puppy and now because they've had her for three weeks they think they get to keep her. what can i do? i have all of the papers that prove i own her (dog licence, proof of ownership, medical records, etc) and she is chipped. i also have that police report. what do i need to do to get my dog back?",2

"mother in law suing my wife for ""grandparent rights"". so today in the mail we received a letter from the county court of where my mother in law lives and she is suing us for ""grandparent rights"" a little back story.

\*courts based in upstate ny\*

over the last almost 8 years me and my wife have been  together her parents always have despised me cause i was a punk city boy and my wife was a good country girl. we moved in after 6 months and have been happy together since. we got married back in 2015 so we are coming up on a 4 year anniversary and things got better for awhile until we bought our first house and i got a job where i started making a lot of money. me and my wife now live a very comfortable life nice cars house etc.

back on thanksgiving of last year is when shit hit the fan. her mother said some very hurtful stuff about me and my wife to my brother in laws girlfriend, my wife and her are very close so she tells her everything and once the beans were spilled my wife confronted her mother about it. her mom made every excuse under the sun instead of just saying sorry she was wrong (we know she said it because there was text proof). we haven't talked to her only once or twice since thanksgiving.

today we received a letter in the mail from her county court suing for grandparent rights everything i have read they can only sue if we are ""unfit"" to be parents. my wife and i don't have any alcohol, drug problems, or trouble with the law we have been happily married for almost 4 years and our kids are well taken care of no debt etc. we also never once stated ever she could not see the children not verbally or over text. we just sold our house yesterday expected close is early may and then we are moving to south carolina this has been a plan for years and we finally acted on it back in december.

does she have any ground to stand on? does ny have any laws to that effect where they could force us to give them the kids for visitation? can this stop our move from happening and screw up the sale of my house? any advice is much appreciated.

"by falling asleep then waking up while my roommate bought his date back.. this happened many years ago! but it still an experience that brings a few laughs. (tl:dr at the bottom)

back in college, i shared a room with a 4'9 dude and he was nice man. he would always leave everything spotless, he was an amazing wingman and he always managed to make sure that when we had a few people over that they'd all have food readily available and drinks etc. he was so cool. anyway, he told me he was going to have a date and asked if i'd be going to my friends house for the night (he didn't live too far and i had been talking about meeting him one of the days) i was like ""yeah maybe, ohhh i see you want the room tonight i got you don't worry"". so he's all nervous about his date and i give him a pep talk i said ""you're a good man, your dates gonna be great and you definitely look ace!"" he was all hyped up and left. 

i called my buddy and asked if he was at home, he was actually at work. but, he told me he'll be back home within a couple hours or so. now, my roommate who was on his date told me he would ring or text me to let me know he got back safe to the room and to give me the heads up when to leave. 

so, i figured i got plenty of time. i laid on the bed and basically waited for two hours to go by to get a phone call from my buddy to tell me he had finished work. but, i instead get a text message from him saying he had finished work and that he'll be getting home a lot later than expected. still no sign from my roommate on his date though (who said he'll ring/message me if he's bringing his date back)

then *i ended up falling asleep*

again after waiting for my buddy to message me when he's free to meet. after some time passes i begin to wake up a little because i hear some distorted voices, giggling and bed creaking . i'm like ""oh fuck"" he's with his date, him and her are gonna be pissed if i ruin their night now by waking up, ""why didn't he text me or ring?!!"". so, i stayed stationary and pretended to be asleep. i hear them both get outta bed and lay on the floor (i imagine cause of the bed creaking). i then start to hear the almighty thunderous clapping of balls and i'm seriously trying to hold my laughter in _but_ then i i heard moaning like a japanese anime character.. which confused me. anyway at this point i'm still trying to hold my laughter in, i realised i had knocked my phone near the edge of the bed because of my inability to keep my composure, so i decided to try and grab it splinter cell lock picking style. i grab the phone without being noticed and in that moment curiosity got the better of me. the ball slamming stopped and it went quiet so i decided then take a slight peak to see if him and his date was asleep and if the coast was clear.. *nope!* as i opened my eye all i see is a 6'7, huge bald black dude followed by the deepest male voice i've ever heard in my entire life say ""now say you want more now"" and continue the almighty thunderous ball slamming i see my 4'9 roommate getting absolutely destroyed up and down like a goddamn yo yo waving his arms in the sky like when you was a kid and needed a piss but you was in class and you had to raise your hand impatiently to get the teachers attention to go to the bathroom. i again stayed stationary as possible with tears of laughter running down my eyes. all the business stopped and the behemoth of a man left the dorm and my roommate just went straight to bed humming. 

the next day i got up early, showered and decided to get mcdonalds breakfast for myself and my roommate and a strong coffee (believe me, even i felt exhausted after all of that). i come back to the room to see my roommate watching tv as if nothing happened whatsoever. i said ""well tell me about the date? was she nice?"" whilst he grinned and ate his sausage mcmuffin. he just looked at me and said ""it was so much fun we're going to meet again very soon"". 

now, i didn't want to say anything because his sexuality is his business and he'll say when the time was right (he did a month later). so, i said ""i'm glad you had a good time"". as i leave the room and make my way down the hallway, what do i see?? the behemoth black dude walking down hallway with the look of a man on a mission, literally like terminator as he walks through the hallway of the psychiatric hospital. i took a last glance through the window while the dude made his way to my room. so, when my friend said ""we're going to meet again _soon_"" little did i know it would be less than 10 hours from the other night. but at least this time they had all the privacy they wanted and i didn't have to almost die of laughter. 

tl;dr - roommate went on a date, brought back home his date, didn't know his date was another dude, i fell asleep and eventually woke up to see him getting destroyed by a dude the size of bob sapp(https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/071/282/bobsapp_crop_north.jpg?1357083029&amp;w=630&amp;h=420) who came back less than 10 hours later for round two. and i'm 99% certain he ate my mcdonalds hashbrown that i left on the side.

"the husband leans over and asks his wife. ""do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? we went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and i made love to you.""

yes, she says, ""i remember it well.""

ok, he says, ""how about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.

the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.

so, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""excuse me, but that was something else. you must've had a fantastic sex life together. is there some sort of secret to this?""

shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

"by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.. so, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. one of the classes i was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. while the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. for our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. i did my paper on helium-3 power generation. i worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. the papers were due last night at midnight and i held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. this is where i fucked up big time.

let me tell you a little about myself. i don't work a normal job. i tried it in my first year of school and i really didn't like it. i've worked internships when they came up but outside of that i really didn't ""work"". this and being a student really doesn't mix well though. so, i had to make money some way. for the past 3 years i've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. specifically, for furries. i would write anything. any fetish, any premise, anything. in some parts of that community i became really popular. at one point i was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts i charged  to my customers. am i proud of this? no. i have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. i told myself the minute i got a ""real"" job i was cutting and running from this work.

well, this brings us to last night. i had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. i had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. i was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. i was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. i ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. however, instead of submitting my final paper, i somehow submitted one of the commissions i was working on. this commission is not light either. it is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

so, i went to bed. submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. when i woke up this morning i checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

i want to fucking die right now. i don't know how i'm going to explain why instead of my final i submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. but yeah, i fucked up big time.

tl:dr: in my final semester at college. instead of submitting my final research paper, i submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. professor ""want's to talk"" and i want to die.

obligatory update:

well, i just left his office and i still want to die. not as much though. i took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  i won't lie, when i sat down with him i was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. i guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

i ran down pretty much everything i said here. while he didn't agree with the avenue i was taking to make money he understood why i was doing it.

he had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""customer\_commission\_2nd draft.doc""). i've taken a class from him before and was an a student so he guessed i had submitted the wrong file on accident. he told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

i gave him the copy i brought and he accepted it. he told me to email him the file and he would replace the one i had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" he seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what i had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

like i said. i still want to fucking die right now. at least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . thanks i guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",4

i went for my surgical consultation and the doctor said he would feel much safer waiting for me to terminate before performing the surgery but i would have to schedule the surgery through his assistant a. a called me shortly after the surgical consultation and pressured me the entire phone call to keep the baby but when i told her i was planning on going through with the termination wouldn't schedule my appointment until i had gone through with it. so i've had to put the appointment off and wait until then, which is fine, but my parents are in on why i need the surgery and i've had to come up with excuses as to why i can't schedule it yet because i don't want them to try to pressure me to not terminate. 

fast forward to last tuesday and i get a text from my dad that says something to the effect of 'we know why you haven't scheduled the appointment and we're very disappointed in you.' it turns out that they called the office and the assistant disclosed my pregnancy to my parents and it's causing me a great deal of emotional turmoil because my parents have been acting super weird around me and now i'm doubly stressed about the situation. i never gave her or anyone else to disclose my medical status to anyone and i feel like my rights as a patient have been violated.
 
i guess my questions would be: do i have grounds for legal recourse, what would my next steps be and what should i do from here.

"twice by grabbing a new coworkers boob and then forgetting her husband died.    happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. on wednesday's our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it's a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. it is normal to carpool all together and naturally i drive my two friend-coworkers each time. however this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we'll call her sarah (changed). she's quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. while everyone is leaving the office for lunch i offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. now here's where the first fuck up happens.
   while on the way to the restaurant sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. traffic comes to a halt and i slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. i check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing i am currently full on honkin sarah's right knocker my words start to trail off. ""damn i hope everyone is oka....."" that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that i was just reacting to the situation. for the next few minutes the car was silent until sarah said ""that's funny i haven't had that much action in a while"" which eased the mood and the car all laughed. and fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying ""ahh well we all have our dry spells."" something i thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. she goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. 
   we get to lunch and everything seems okay but sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so i ask what's up. she told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. i instantly apologized saying i had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that i was sorry. she said she didn't care about that and that it was fine it's just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. my heart sunk. i had completely forgotten about her husband. i felt so bad i instantly started apologizing for everything in the world i felt horrible. my friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. i feel so horrible that i have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. please reddit help me feel a little better.

"if your comment gets thousands of upvotes, don't add a wall of text thanking everyone for their upvotes, and then elaborating on your original post in unnecessary detail.. edit: wow! this really blew up! thanks everyone! never got silver before, much less gold or platinum!!! thank you kind stranger!!! holy moly! i really can't believe it, i just wrote a comment to a front-page post and then left for work, i had no idea the earth shattering impact my opinion would have. i am trying to respond to all the comments but it's hard to keep up! please bear with me! i can't believe how popular i have suddenly become! this has literally changed my life forever! my name has been etched in the anals of history for all eternity as one of the greatest thinkers of all-time!!! you're welcome. 

now, to further elaborate on my original single sentence comment that other people happened to find relatable, it is my opinion that people should definitely not edit their popular comments just to add a wall of text that further elaborates on the point that they already made in a succinct relatable way. the risk of an overly redundant word salad that dilutes the original point of the comment is 100%. instead, just keep it the way it originally started. otherwise you'll end up rambling for no reason, which will likely just weaken your comment, and you'll just end up repeating yourself.",6
"for attacking a muslim's beliefs when she didn't want to sit next to my brother and his friend on the plane?. long time lurker, here is my first post!

so i (f16) was on a flight from dubai to new york, so it was quite a long trip. usually we are upgraded to business class on this airline since our dad is a pilot, but because my brother's friend couldn't afford the seat, we decided to stay in economy. our mother was sitting in business class so she wasn't present during this whole situation.

when we got on the plane, my twin brother and his friend, 16 and 15, were in the row in front of me, my brother in the window seat and his friend in the aisle. i was sitting right behind his friend in the aisle seat.

then his woman got on, she was wearing a hijab, so it was obvious that she was a muslim. i saw her looking very uncomfortable when she saw my brother and his friend, knowing that she had the middle seat. 

i wasn't paying attention but i took off my headphones when i heard my brother's friend say no to the lady. she then said: ""it is against my religion to touch men in public"" and my brother said,

""but we're not touching you.""

she looked very angry and was almost yelling at my brother's friend to move to the middle seat so she could have the aisle. i thought she was so entitled, so i told them,

""don't move. just ignore her.""

she then proceeded to ask me if i knew them, so i said yes. she asked to switch with me. so this is what i said,

""no. i don't want the middle seat because i'm very claustrophobic (i'm not, i just prefer the aisle seat so i can stretch my legs)"" and she said, 

""that's not my problem.""

that's when i got really pissed and i said it,

""your religion is not our problem. should've chosen better seats then"" 

then she stomped her foot and went to the flight attendant, and that's the last we saw of her. i'm guessing they moved her to another empty seat. 

when we got back from the trip, my brother's friend told me he was going to move and i wasn't right to attack her religion like that.

"by unintentionally betraying the trust of my new kitten. (nsfw)?. obligatory, wasn't today, but 2 days ago.

so my gf and i adopted a new kitten a week ago. she's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or i go. she also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.

well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and i had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as i had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. so i went into the bathroom and began to pee. as i was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all i could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. i looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. i started screaming ""oh fuck!"" and managed to pinch off my stream. the kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as i pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. this all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

it took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. i set her in the tub and i had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. i got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. the last few nights i've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. i dont know what shes planning, but i'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

my girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that i pissed on our new kitten..

tl:dr - i gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... to my new kitten...

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

ok so i first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200b;

so after a week of avoiding i came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. she was happy to see me and i told her to sit down because we need to talk.

i started things with saying that i know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. her face turned red and she started crying like hell. she knew what i was talking about. i told her the story about the dna test, about jennet and basically what i told you guys in the last post.

well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. she told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. he didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

she told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. when the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. after a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. as they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. she tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when i started crying. she started crying too. the couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. we were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. it took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(they came to their senses after a day or so). she reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. she made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

a few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. after so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. he met me a few times and i knew him as one of rose's old friends from the park. he helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. ironically i'm glad i got to know him before he passed, even if i didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200b;

btw, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200b;

so after hearing this i told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and i told her i understand she did the right thing. i pulled out an ""it's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and i headed off to my parents(adoptive) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200b;

i'm glad she is my mother. i feel for the first time in years - complete. i don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and i honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. thanks reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!",8
"the body acceptance movement should be about height, not weight.. you can control your weight, but you cannot control your height. if you have weight problems you should try and help them. i can't tell you how to live your life but you shouldn't accept something that could greatly shorten your life if you can use hard work and determination to solve it. i've learned to accept my height. i can't change it, so why stress about it? i can't change girls' preferences, so i just have to live with it because there's nothing i can do about it. weight, that's a different story


edit: a lot of people are saying ""why not both"", but the answer is in the post. being obese has a direct correlation to disease and living a shorter amount of time, so i feel like it shouldn't be accepted (with the exception of metabolic diseases that cause obesity)

also i would like to add that pretty much anything you can't change like your skin color and face should be a part of it too. i have to thank some people in the comments for opening my eyes on that opportunity. the reason i chose height is because i personally feel like short people get shit on possibly more than anything else. if you think that's bullshit, scroll down and you'll see countless comments of people calling me ""manlet"", ""incel"", and ""midget""",6
"was i sexually assaulted? if so, what should i do?. for the past couple of months, i've been working in a restaurant. there's this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she's looking through my social media profiles, won't stop snapping me or facebooking me, i've since deleted her snapchat and blocked her on facebook. 

anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. i moved my arm away to which she responded ""don't you like to be touched?"" to which i responded ""not by you"". so she went to kick me in the balls but i moved out of the way and said ""no chance"". 

as we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. she moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which i pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. she said ""i'm only joking"" before trying to do it again in fucking plain sight of the others. i told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. all the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. the manager wasn't present during this.

anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said ""dude, isn't that basically sexual assault?"" i responded ""is it?"" he said ""man, she literally molested you and tried again"" 

honestly, i don't know what to think. i am contemplating telling the manager but i feel she'll laugh it off and class it as a joke because i'm a man. and no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn't taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. just think of it, if i had done that, i'd be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case. 

edit: i just wanna do all i can without making this a police matter. i really can't deal with that kinda stress right now so all i wanna do is sort this quickly without making a huge song and dance about it.",7
"by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home. my friend jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and i finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  i ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

i made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  dude was intimidating and i'm a 4'11"" woman so i was immediately scared.  he looked shocked to see me.  i'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that i surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

i panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  i'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  i start screaming at him to get the fuck out and that i'm calling the police (total bluff because i didn't have my phone.)  he then yells back that he is calling the police on me.  this gives me pause.  at this point, i look around and realize the bedroom i'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  i ask him through the door if he knows jenna (last name).  he tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  well.  apparently, jenna's neighbor also keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

so, today i fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  

tl;dr today i fucked up by wasting a sandwich.",4
"for telling my mom she's the reason i don't want any kids?. i (23f) am the oldest of 4 siblings. my dad passed away when i was 14, leaving us and my mom. 

there's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. so when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. if i had to guess i'd say i spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. plus an hour or so on chores. 

now i love my siblings, and i love my mom. but from when i was 14 till i moved out at 19 i had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. all there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

i'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. i've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. i've politely told her i don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

when she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after i told her to stop asking) i told her ""giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" i didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

she cried. i told her i don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. i didn't apologise. 

aita?

edit: when i said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" i wasn't trying to be malicious. 
a) she at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why i had to. 
b) i called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, i had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

i wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why i said it that way.

edit 2: yes, i'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. i was there. i never said i don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. i'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and i don't want kids because of that.

edit 3: for the people pming and commenting about how it's my fault i didn't have friends and not my mom's: i wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

last edit: for everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

actually the last edit: my mom came home around 6:30, that didn't mean i only watched the kids till 06:30. i usually was the one who cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work.",3

"update: i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone.. it's been a long night. thank you all for staying patient. also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

first off i just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. i'm still trying to work through all of your pm's because i'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. i have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. i never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if i can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice i used from reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon cp and find this thread (at least in canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

i also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, i understand. this is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as i wish i had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary karma, i don't. to provide proof i have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what i have written.

yesterday i was picked up by my best friend alex around 2:30. we drove around and talked for a while. i went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. we drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. david was home, in my room, and immediately i noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. he said he had to admit something to me. i prepared for him to admit to possessing cp but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. i feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. he  said no. i asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. i don't know why i was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the cp but i really thought he'd admit to it then and there. instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. he asked me if that changed my perception of him and i said no. he grew quiet again and i left to go shower. when i came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. it was about 1030 at this point. when he left, i finally lost it and broke down. i grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. i was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

i grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency rcmp line for my city. shaking and crying i explained to the lady on the phone that i had discovered cp on my boyfriend's phone. she put me through to the report line and i spoke to another constable who told me i would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. i waited for around 10 minutes. the officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. i asked if i could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, crown counsel has clear evidence that i was not coerced into stating what i witnessed. i don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time i wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if david was there and if i could safely leave without arousing suspicion. luckily david knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so i made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. david didn't seem to question it and i waited for the officer to arrive. 

he called me from a blocked number and i walked outside and down the block to his suv. the constable and another officer greeted me,  i got into the front seat and we drove to the station. during the ride i asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. he explained that i had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying david. he said if i had taken david's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. it was about 11:15 at this point. they placed me in an interview room and i sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. the officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. he said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 he started off by asking me details about my life, where i grew up, past employment etc. after that portion he asked me about david, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else i knew about him. i told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but i did express that things had been moving very quickly. he agreed. he then got me to explain how i came upon the photos in question, so i did. then came the worst part. he asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos i explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. it was intense but by some grace of god i was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and i was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. he asked me if i would testify in court and i said i would. the officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. the full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

after i had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. they explained how the process would go and whether i wanted a no contact agreement.  i said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. that made sense to me so i chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

we got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. i told them i was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (i didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. i've never felt so anxious in my life. i asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. about 15 minutes later i saw them bringing david out in handcuffs. my heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. i curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told i could go back inside. after another eternity (my phone had died by this point but i know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. i was told by the officer i could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. the officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that i did a brave thing and to be well. 

i went back into my house, put planet earth on for background noise and called my other best friend paige who had been keeping up with me about this since i sent her my reddit post. we were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. it was david. he was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. my jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and i was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. paige asked me if everything was okay and i told her david had walked through the door, i would call her back. immediately david came to the bed where i was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. he said he didn't know i would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. he asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. i lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. he sobbed more and loudly said ""that isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who i am"" and cried more and more. his body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. it was immensely difficult to witness and i wish i could have told him to get the fuck out but i just sat there immobilized, in shock. it was well close to 5 in the morning and i hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

david began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. i asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. he said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. i asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. he said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. i nodded. i asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. he admitted they were very explicit photos and i asked how he even found them; i don't recall we ever got to that. he promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but i don't really believe that. he apologized to me more times than i could count and asked if i hated him. i told him i wasn't sure that i felt hatred for him but i was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; i told him how terribly i felt betrayed and hurt and violated. i expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

then i heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. three officers were outside, two of whom i recognized from earlier and they asked me if david was here. i said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because paige had called in. i realized i had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know i was okay, bless her heart. the officers took david outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. i told them i was okay; that i would finish my discussion with him and if i had any issues i had them on speed dial. they nodded and left. 

david sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and i just sat and well, endured it. tears just ran and ran and ran from him. he said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure i expected to hear this great big apology. he said if i thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what i had to go through. i just nodded. there was silence for a long time, i think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. i don't know how long i stared at my tv screen that said ""are you still watching: planet earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. i had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. i think david was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. i didn't know or care, i was just numb. i would have probably sat like that until i died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. i got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. my brain wasn't capable of thought so i stared at my tv screen until i passed out sometime around 9. 

i didn't sleep for long because when i woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. david was awake and crying still. when he realized i was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. i just stared at him. he started apologizing and apologizing more. he expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that i was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. he expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. i shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. at this point i finally asked him to leave. i told him i needed space to sort out my emotions, and i needed to get some sleep.  i asked him if he would be okay. he nodded and grabbed his things. he said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what i wanted him to do. i said nothing. he expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. he said i love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

i've been laying in bed since then and writing this. i just want this to be over. i just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. also i think i forgot to add that his court date is set for june. as far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography i believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  i will post updates again if i feel  they are important; otherwise i will update again in june when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. i have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and i would have been so lost without some of your advice. i'll continue working on replying to your pm's, but in the meantime i think i'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

tldr: filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested david and seized his phone. he signed a promise to appear in court in june. he awaits sentencing.

"by becoming an accidental active school shooter. this happened in the oughties. tl/dr below.

my (relatively small) hs held an unexpected live active shooter drill.  it was the first time they had ever done this. i don't know who developed this genius procedure. it actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.

we had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. the teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn't tell us because... the trauma would help us react better? no idea. in fact, i remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.

however, it so happened that i was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. my teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. now i understand why. (his mistake, but i played my part soon after)

on my way to the office (i was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. i was truly in a wtf state.

here's where i f-up. now i am the only dummy walking the hallways. given the layout of this building, when i tell you it was dark, i mean ""you could hardly see your own hand"" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. and it was completely silent now. it all happened in a matter of seconds. i can't say i was scared necessarily because we all knew that there'd likely be a live drill at some point. still, given my aversion to our principal since i was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, i just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. i assumed my teacher knew what was happening and i didn't want to be in more trouble so i just yelled

**""hey let me in!!""**

the entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. this coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as i recall.  (again, this was not a well thought-out plan).

now of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn't relayed properly and i'll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice i had heard in my life said

**""get on the ground!!!""**

there was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! so whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought i somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, i don't know. he did not have his gun drawn, just his flashlight. he grabbed me up and took me to the office.

the rest was a huge blur but essentially i was not punished for that, but i got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. there was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.

&#x200b;

tl/dr: became unaccounted for just as an active school shooter drill was initiated, ran around and scared the life out of roughly 50 people.

"bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because i dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?. i have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way i dress. my neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

about a month ago, i moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. i didn't expect any trouble. my first introduction to this woman, let's call her karen, was my first week here. i went to check the mail and i wasn't wearing a bra. i had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. karen is one of *those* southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. you know the type. she waved at me and i waved back, trying to be pleasant. she came at me, i thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

it was creepy and weird. i am not at all well endowed, i go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not karen. karen urged me to think of her children and jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. it was so goddamn weird, i felt like laughing in her face, but i didn't want there to be issues so i said i'd be more diligent in the future and karen went about her business.

well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for karen, y'all, oh no. not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. while my breasts are small and humble, i am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

the second time karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. she threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated i got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a jezebel and that i needed jesus. because i was wearing jean shorts.

we live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and i like to go out for walks, but it seems every time i step foot out of my door, there's fucking karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. it's getting annoying. 

this is in florida, by the way.

edit: i got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (i do not regularly dress like this) i must have been quite a sight to karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. she started laying into me. i just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then i said ""you can stop the games, karen. i see the way you look at me, i know you want me."" her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""i'll pray for you."" then scurried away. actually went inside her house. 😂",2

"by trusting some rando on airbnb. shit river 2k19

we have a thousand words to explain all that transpired with our dear friend paul from august 3rd to august 4th, 2019. let me spin you a tale...a tale of shit river.

4:30 pm

our initial impressions of the house were terrific! our illustrious host, paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. paul was friendly! check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. everything was looking great!

6:00 pm

we return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. we fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. we had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! a few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.

8:15 pm

after a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. we discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). plunging half successfully, we messaged paul and let him know the situation. only one working toilet isn't ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we'd make it work!

8:38 pm

the remaining toilet won't flush. the party grows worried. paul assures us that he will call a plumber.

9:00 pm

paul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won't be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. a five second google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in virginia beach, but paul did not want to call them. after ""informing"" our dear friend paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. a plumber was found! magic!

9:30 pm

raw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. the house likely possessed. drinks have been drunk like it's the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or uber to safety. after all, where would we go? we pray to whatever eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.

10:01 pm

the stench. dear god. the stench.

11:20 pm

emergency plumber arrives with paul and paul's friend in tow. one of them goes to the roof. one of them pounds a pabst blue ribbon. advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. we split the party.

12:20 am

plumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for ""the final blasting."" paul's friend fails to discover how to ""switch off his nose"" and taps out (""i'm out man, i'm out.""). it's been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. the backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *for now.*

12:22 am

paul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. classic paul! we oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.

12:24 am

the final blasting. the stench. the horror. the splatter. we all take 2d6 damage.

1:00 am

paul & co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. he requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. we decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. we also decide to leave the next morning.

2:00 am: the witching hour

lights flicker ominously. the house isn't finished with us yet…

4:30 am

paul offers a full refund (excellent). he later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). we ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. he offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).

10:30 am

the party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. we take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the toilet gods.

11:10 am

we commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. after completion, we agree never to speak of this again. who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?

11:11 am

the great gurgle. we hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. was it the broken spirit of paul's friend chugging another pbr? nope. the shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.

11:15 am

we hasten our efforts to flee. paul is called. we finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.

11:30 am

we convene to discuss departure. suddenly, one of our party realizes we've been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping shit river pooling in the hallway. fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the rubicon. we form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.

11:32 am

water oozes up from the baseboards. satan's septic tank thirsts for blood. the lights flicker once more.

11: 35 am

our dearest friend paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: ""this house is fucked."" agreeing with paul's uncanny observation, we flee the house. the smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.

"my (21f) boyfriend (22m) said he wouldn't want to date me if i had slept with as many people as him.. i'm not to sure how this was brought up but last night we were laying in bed when he said that if i had had slept with as many people as him (roughly 30) then he wouldn't have wanted to date me. he also said that it's a turn off that i slept with him on the first date and he's surprised that he like me because of this. 

he said something about it being instinctual for guys to want to sleep with a lot of girl and a status thing, which is why it makes it okay for him to have that history and not me.

i find this logic very sexist and full of double standard. i'm super pissed and not sure how to handle it.

"my sister abandoned our autistic brother with me. now 6 months later finally admitted that she won't be resuming custody, and has told me he is now ""my problem"" as she won't be coming back to canada. is this legal..?. i am in **ontario, canada** while my sister was in vancouver bc.

my brother is on the spectrum, and he is someone who basically needs constant and around the clock care. he is in his 20's now, but mentally he is about \~8 years old.

nearly a year ago my mom suddenly passed away due to a blood clot in the brain, it came out of nowhere and shocked our family and my dad passed a few years back from cancer. 3 years ago our mom had a will drawn up, and my older sister basically agreed in the event of something happening she would be responsible for my brother (there were a ton of reasons for this specifically the fact she lived within my brothers support network, while i am far away). in agreement with this my mom put aside a large amount of money for the purpose of my brothers well being.

my sister and her fiancee took my brother in for about 6 months, but it became very apparent that she misunderstood the amount of work required for his care. she asked if i would be willing to take him for a month or so while she went and took time off. i agreed simply because of the fact i am now a stay at home mom, but told her i couldn't do this for long.

one month turned into two, and then finally 4. she kept making excuse after excuse, but she finally agreed that she would take him when they got back from a vacation in europe to visit her fiancee's family. when she got back she would let me know. then basically nothing, absolutely fucking nothing for two months. never responded to any of my emails, messages or phone calls.

finally yesterday i received a long facebook message from her telling me:

* she isn't coming back to canada, as she has decided to get married in europe and live there with her fiancee.
* she isn't coming back for my brother, and said i needed to take care of him as he is now ""my problem"".
* she said she was sorry but she couldn't deal with him anymore.

she has blocked me on facebook, and her cell phone number no longer seems to work anymore.

i know this sounds cold, but i can't do this. i can't take care of my brother anymore. on top of this all the money that my parents put aside for my brother, aside from a bit she sent me early on i have no idea where that money is or where it went.

i have tried a variety of services, and explained my situation about my brother, but i have discovered there is basically fuck all help for me. i was told it could take several years to find a place for him in a care facility, and it is just wait list after wait list.

so like my question is, can my sister really just abandon him like this? isn't there some sort of law against basically abandoning someone your responsible for? i know he isn't a child anymore, but mentally he is.

to clarify a few things, i love my brother, but he is far too much for me to handle and my toddler. we have been struggling to make ends meet financially, with the increased upkeep cost. to the point where i worry for our future. i can't leave my brother alone, so i working is out of the question.

"update: i am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. my step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. can someone help me please?. i posted this a few weeks ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i\_am\_supposed\_to\_have\_money\_put\_aside\_for\_me\_for/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i_am_supposed_to_have_money_put_aside_for_me_for/)

i just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). i was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

he was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. one of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

he gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

i also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* they both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. they aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. with her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. so now she is paying her way. 

anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

thank you so much for your help.",2
what is the scariest story you know that is 100% true?. ,1
"because i ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?. what i thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and i'm up at 7:05 am dealing with it. i figured while i wait for a text, i could post here to see if what i did was really that bad. 

i'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. i love to eat which probably borders on addiction but i figure since i'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. i have some great friends although there is no doubt i'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. i guess that sets the stage enough. 

last night my friend hosted ufc and i was invited. he got a 6 foot party sub. i also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. well of course people flocked to the food and i had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and i didn't get to have a single one. which is totally fine that's why i brought them but maybe an hour later i was starving. i kept eyeing the sandwich and i'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. i waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). so i was like screw it...i took about half of what was left and ate it. then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

well to be sure as i was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. like i was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. i guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. she was furious and said that i was an incredible pig and that i had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. i felt so bad i tried to explain to her that i really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. i also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

i offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. i said i was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

i woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that i had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that i embarrassed myself last night. i tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

was i the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

edit: i guess i've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so i can't find out why.

to answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. this is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but i can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",3

"by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.. today was the day i realised i messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

for the last 12 months i've been commenting on peoples posts, i've created my own posts. i haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as i can remember so i just figured i wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

last month i started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, i could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

anyway, i finally mailed the help team and found out my ip was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, i'm still in my own little truman show)

please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that i've been such an idiot for so long. it's ok to laugh with/at me :)

edit 3: reddit is awesome. i've missed you guys! dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real pita. its just one of those things and i thank them for putting in the hours.

i also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. most of us here use reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

i love all of you weirdos <3

"if i talk to my 18 yo brother about age of consent against my mothers wishes?. my brother is 18. he has a 15 year old girlfriend. age of consent where he lives is 16. they are both in highschool, he is a senior, she is a junior.

to my knowledge, he is still a virgin. he does know the basics about sexual health, pregnancy, prevention, and std prevention. another thing my mother and i butt heads about but she gave in on that one.

my mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. she said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. it wasn't necessary. i implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.

last night i called my brother and discussed it with him myself. i didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. he also told me they haven't done anything yet. i told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. i told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  i also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that i wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.

i tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk. my mother is pissed that i talked to him about it when she told me no.

for wanting my brother to be informed and safe?

edit: if it matters, i'm his sister and i am 26. i live out of state. 

edit: he lives in ct since a bunch of people have asked. i mentioned in a few comments, but now it's here too.

edit: thank you so much for the input and support. i'm going to have a follow up conversation with him about sexting and exchanging pictures also consent as a whole. i had missed that topic on the earlier conversation. also big thank you for the gold! this is my first.

"i was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the da finally got around to my case. i did nothing wrong.. okay, so a few days ago i was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. i lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

i was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (i'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest i didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something i did not do). i had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where i was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. i'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything i told him to at this appearance i had because a simple background check shows i don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened i was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). he literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

so then i sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. i tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper i had but he was never in and never came to see me. i couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. i don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, i was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because i can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months i'm about to owe.

when he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the da who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter i mailed them until then also. after that appearance i got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and i was released.

what can i do for any of this? apparently someone with the same name but a different dob shot a building after a fight and is a felon but i sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless i pay some crazy fees (how am i liable for these fees if it was a error?!). this is in madison, wisconsin

edit: thanks for all the replies guys and gals, i'll contact the wisconsin branch of the aclu tomorrow and see what they say and where to go from here. also i appreciate the messages offering to help me if i need it but i can kinda survive frugally on my credit cards if absolutely need be and will be contacting my boss tomorrow also and explaining the situation.

edit 2: to clear up more confusion about my car. the city had it towed by a local company they are contracted with. the storage fees are $1900 and growing daily and i only paid $3500 for the car 2 years ago. the towing company that has my vehicle told me the city can waive their percentage and pay the rest to them and i can get my car but told ""good luck"". also their policy is to only store the vehicles for 90 days before auctioning the car.",2
"update: my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help.. edit:  here is the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/azwevy/my_wife_30f_suffers_from_extreme_germophobia_and/), for those that havent seen it

&#x200b;

its been awhile since my original post, but i didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

since then, not much has improved. i decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. to my surprise, she agreed and i was so happy.

unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  i had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

this was the hardest thing i have ever had to do.  i feel so broken right now.  i'm going to see a counselor in hopes that i can figure out what to do.

i dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but i pray that she takes advantage of it because i still love her and i did this because i still do.

i told myself i would stop enabling her, mainly because i just cannot sustain this life. i am physically and mentally exhausted.  my kids are my top priority but i cant take care of them if i dont first take care of myself.

i thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. she was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and i hope that it will help her.

thanks for reading.",8
"update: i 22f just found out my boyfriend 27m has been having sex with me when i'm sleeping after i've taken sleeping pills.. previous post can be found here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bovqbj/i_22f_just_found_out_my_boyfriend_27f_has_been/) but the tl;dr is in the title. i have really bad insomnia and often take pills that knock me out completely. i'm pretty much dead to the world when i take them. recently, about 2 weeks ago, i found out that my boyfriend would have sex with me while i was knocked out despite me saying that i wasn't up for sex before i fell asleep. i woke up that day because i was feeling unwell for different reasons and hadn't taken my insomnia pills. he didn't see what was wrong with him doing what he did.

&#x200b;

now for the update. after i found out what happened, i went to my older brother's house and have been staying with him since. i'm so incredibly lucky to have him. it was from his house that i made the last post. after that post, i was replying to the comments until i fell asleep. the majority of them told me that my boyfriend was raping me and that i need to break up with him and report him to the police. that was something i didn't wasn't to have to do. when i woke up in the morning, i had almost 600 more replies and i got really overwhelmed and had to step back and decide for myself what i was going to do. so that is exactly what i did.

&#x200b;

i had decided that everyone deserves a second chance. i wanted to talk to my boyfriend explain why i wasn't okay with what happened and why it was wrong. i went into that conversation with every intention of staying with him and giving him a second chance.

&#x200b;

so i called him over a little over a week ago so we could talk. i started to explain everything to him and why i had to go away for a while. the conversation was going okay at the beginning. but then it took a turn. as soon as i brought up the fact that i wold him no to sex before i feel asleep but he did it anyway, he kinda snapped. he started yelling. he started throwing things. he got scary violent. telling me that he knew i was insinuating that he had raped me. saying i was accusing him of something very serious. i hadn't said to him that he had raped me. i hadn't even gotten the chance to tell him that i was going to give him another chance.

&#x200b;

then things took another turn. in my last post, people were accusing me of attention seeking. i don't want to come off that way so i am not going to disclose what happened. i'm still trying to process everything and wondering how i could be so wrong about a person.

&#x200b;

i just want to say thank you to everyone who commented and messaged me on my last post. you have no idea how much it meant to me to have your support, especially when my boyfriend was trying to convince me i was the one who was wrong. i'm sorry i didn't listen to you guys. i was wrong. but i think what happened would have happened regardless of what decision i had made. maybe it was better that way because now i know for sure. i don't know what is going to happen in the future, but for now i'm living with my brother and trying to get my life back in order.

&#x200b;

again, thank you.

&#x200b;

edit: some people have asked of he is now my ex. i guess i didn't really directly say that he is. we are no longer together. and never will be again. even if i decided to get back together with him for some crazy reason, my brother will never let that happened after what transpired that day.

&#x200b;

edit 2: it's come up a lot. people are asking to telling me to report him tit he police. my brother did report him. another thing people keep asking is what happened. call me an attention seeker if you want. i don't care anymore. what i left out was that when he got violent, he tried to rape me. if my brother hadn't heard him and pulled him off of me, he would have succeeded. it's so embarrassing, not just that i was almost taped but that my brother found me like that.",8
"my daughter disowned my underage grandson. what do i do?. i posted in r/justnofamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation.

"my sister(f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even if my mom(46f) is pressuring me to, for families sake.. i made a post yesterday but forgot my password so i made a new alt.

okay so i am a huge marvel nerd. the kind of nerd that cosplays, goes to cons and draws her own stuff. mostly fanservice.

my sister ridicules my hobby saying that it's pathetic and ""retarded"". she claims i am delusional as a grown woman playing dress up.

besides that we have a good relationship. we are not friends but sisters if that makes sense.

so 3 years ago i managed to safe up enough to go to a con in the usa and meet the real stan lee! he signed one of my own pictures i did of the big 3 and complimented it. it's was one of the best days of my life.
since then the signed picture has always been on my wall.

flash forward. a few weeks ago my sister asks for my jacket and i tell her no. reason being that she was a bitch to me the whole week. she pouted and i left the house.

when i come back is see my fucking stan lee autograph ripped up on the flor! i fucking lost it. then my sister came in and started teasing me (look at that  grown ass woman crying over a piece of paper). when she saw that i was for real distressed she started saying that it was just a piece of paper that i can get a new one.

i pushed her out of my room and have been extremely short with her since. she tries to engage in conversation but i shoot her down. she tries to bribe me with movie tickets and i tell her to go with her boyfriend etc. she hasn't apologized for it. she just says that i should be over it by now.

my mom says the same. she says a materialistic things shouldn't come in between family and that i should simply let it go. my dad is also really mad at sister and by extention mom. he is as big on marvel as me and he was livid when he found out. this whole ordeal is literally splitting our family apart.

my mother and sister think i am being unfair by not letting go and i think they both disrespected me. mom is mad at dad for not ""talking sense into me and taking my side"" and dad is mad at mom for ""failing to punish my sister and spoiling her""

i feel awfully guilty but also raging mad. can somone help me with this?

edit :thanks guys for listening to me. i feel a lot better. i will take what many of you said and i am going to send them examples of how much stan lee's autograph costs. but i think i have to word it very good so that they don't think that i would ""split up the family over money""

update : thanks for the support. my dad and i found somone that restored pictures and we are taking my piece to it. dad is going to use part of the money he was going to gift my sister for her car down-payment. as you can imagine sister threw a fit and is staying with mom at my grandparents now.",8
"by wearing the wrong size shoes for my entire adult life.. okay, so by standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony i unintentionally put myself through, i think it qualifies.

i have fairly weird-sized feet.  they're very wide, but not all that long.  i have no arch to speak of.  i'm a fairly short guy, about 5'7"", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  i'm pretty short so i should be wearing a fairly small size, right?

wrong.

when i was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure i had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.

as an adult, i assumed, well, since i'm full-grown, i should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  for me, that's a size 10 (us).

problem was, i kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, i'll switch to size 10w.

still no luck.  still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  my running shoes were so ill-fitted that i actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.

my friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn't need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5w nikes.  i said, ""sure, fuck it, i'll take them, let's see how they fit.""

oh.  my.  god.

it was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  i was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  i had no idea how much misery i had been in until i wore those shoes.  i wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because i was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn't realize it.  there's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.

tl;dr - i'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years i have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because i was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes.",4
"update - mi, usa considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now i have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

i promised an update so here it is. first off, i want to thank everyone who strongly suggested i go see a doctor asap. i went to see an ent and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. my hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. the tinnitus was still quite bad, so i wanted to see if the doc could help with that. he put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. i saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (this was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

the ringing has gone down considerably, and i'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. it still bothers me at night and while i'm trying to work sometimes. the biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so i haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. this has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point i'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

my uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. i'm not planning on suing him. he knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what i was going through. my aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. i haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. they have offered to call me and apologize but i don't want to talk to them. i just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. i'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but i don't care. fuck that guy. thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice.",2

"by going to bed drunk.. so last night i went out as i do every saturday.
when i got there i met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than i could handle. after that i went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as i was trying to lay down on it ""just to rest for a moment"".

i woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. it was cold and i couldn't move it at all.
at first i didn't panic at all because this has happened to me before because i sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. however today i slept with my arm under the side of my body ( i got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. after about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement i woke up my parents and after i explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.

during my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.
however my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. after getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which i hope i never do again) i waited for the results. a little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. 

it appears that i have done damage to a nerve with my hip while i was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (i'm right handed) fingers . at first the doctor didn't know how i managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after i told him what i have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.

now i'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.

to answer the most common question, inkjet ink is exceptionally expensive and priced that way because the company's got you where they want you by selling you a cheap printer. laser printers use toner which is more expensive to replace, but lasts longer. inkjet ink dries out when it's not used and is wasted. kinda like running the engine on a car when it's not being driven.

"for telling my wife to get out of bed and feed the damn cat.. alright everyone, i need some judgement on this one...

my wife and i have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up to feed him. this only happens on weekends.

monday-friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. however on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. he will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.

here's where the story takes a twist. awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. when we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. i thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.

my wife disagreed. her reasons range from:

concerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.

concerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.

concerned the cat won't ""love"" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.

concerned it's a waste of batteries.

i've told my wife i understand all of her concerns but i still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. she still disagrees.

so i did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ultimatum! 

i told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, i'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.

so reddit, aita?

edit: i'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.

edit 2: many people have been demanding i pay the ""cat tax"" and post a picture of the real ah in question. sadly i am a reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. if anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, i will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.

"(ok) mom passed away and things aren't adding up.. update

the last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.  i kinda feel like i'm living in one of those crime novels. at one point, i seriously considered walking away from it all because there were enough things that took place to make me feel like it was a possibility i might find myself having some kind of ""accident"" in the near future. 

i obviously won't be able to share too many details...at least not yet...but i do want to let everyone know i have an attorney, as well as a private investigator who is a retired fbi agent with a lot of connections. as of today, i have finally been able to locate my mother's body and it has not been cremated. i also have been granted access to her property.  a lot of things are missing.  the vehicle has been reported as stolen as well as a few other items... which i'm sure the list will grow as we continue to go through her belongings. 

thank you to every single one of you who offered your help, resources, experiences, and condolences. i will never be able to express the amount of gratitude i have for your willingness to help a stranger you've never met. you guys are amazing!!

to those of you that called me a karma farmer and questioned the validity of my personal hell...i hope you step on legos barefooted and catch your pinky toe on the coffee table. when you do, think of me.




i'm not really sure what to make of all this and i could really use some insight on the matter. evidently my mom passed away last wednesday june 5th...i say evidently because my brother and i weren't notified until yesterday evening of her passing. 

i'm not entirely clear on the details because the circumstances are not adding up and i'm afraid if i try and explain the chain of events... it'll become extremely confusing but i feel like the manner in which this was handled seems fishy.  

we first learned of the news from a friend of our mother's who says she recieved a phone call yesterday (4 days after my mother's passing) from someone claiming to be a sheriff of the county my mother resided in, informing her my mother had passed away and asked if she happened to have keys to my mother's house because they were trying to locate next of kin. (see...weird huh?) he claims he found her number by going through my mother's phone (which would've been with her in her house, where they found her so why do they need keys) she told them she did not have keys but they could try calling her children (me and my brother) or her brother (my uncle) and that our numbers should also be in the same phone. 

my mother's friend calls me to ask what was going on and did something happen to my mom and while i'm talking to her, my uncle calls me... which is odd because i haven't spoken to him in over 10 years and i wasn't even aware he had my number. he immediately goes into this whole story about how my mom passed away last wednesday of a massive heart attack in her home and the police from her town contacted him after they were sent to her house to do a welfare check and found her. they supposedly went through her phone and saw he was the last person she talked to so they contacted him first. then without skipping a beat or even giving me a chance to process all of this,  he goes on to tell me that my mother had informed him on multiple occasions that she was leaving everything to him and that he was to make sure my brother and i, were to receive none her belongings and he kept mentioning his good friend sheriff whats-his-nuts ( fake name for obvious reasons) and his attorney have both informed him he was not to contact my brother or me about the situation and that since my mother left him everything, he needed to remove what he wanted from her home and donate the rest to salvation army. he was making arrangements to have her cremated and would let me know if he decides to do a funeral... then he hung up.

how is that even possible? can he do that? i mean even if by some crazy off the wall chance my mother lost her mind and created a legal living will that named her brother... who's almost 15 years older than my mother by the way... the executor of her will and she left everything she owns to him...is there not some kind of reading of the will my brother and i are required to attend? is this how this stuff goes down? i really can't be involved in making funeral arrangements for my own mother? never once had our mother ever mentioned she had a will and i can not fathom her leaving everything to my uncle. but my feelings aside what is the legal process here? how could i find out for certain if there even is a will? 

the situation gets a little crazier because after i called my brother, he calls my uncle and is told the same thing... they argue a little over the phone and it's now turned into my brother and i are allowed to accompany my uncle to my mother's house, and ""rummage through what's left to see if there's anything we want"" but it has to be this coming wednesday because he has meetings all day tuesday (today) with a probate attorney to iron out the details of my mother's estate. to my knowledge he's already taken her dog and her brand new car, into his possession. 

this makes me think there is no will. if there was a will like he originally claimed, and my brother and i were to receive nothing... how are we all of the sudden allowed to look through what's left?

i'm extremely uncomfortable with this situation. 

the most disturbing part of this whole ordeal is, i know my mother was working on the legal details of an invention she recently had patented and was in the process of interviewing manufacturers to fabricate her invention.  she reviewed all the legal paperwork with my brother and me a few months ago...i'm worried that's why my uncle is in such a hurry to hire a probate attorney, and throw names of law enforcement friends of his (he himself is a retired police officer) which would also explain why it took him 4 days to notify my brother and me about her passing. 

isn't there some kind of chain of command that has to be followed when it comes to notifying next of kin? is there a certain legal process that needs to happen when a person has a will?? or even if they don't?? sorry for the long post. i'm still trying to understand all of this. it just doesn't seem to make any sense. who should i contact first? the police in her area? an attorney? what do i do?

update: i can't respond to anyone now that its been locked but to answer a few questions. no i haven't seen the body though my own eyes and neither has my brother. he and i are getting together today to get a lawyer. this is in fact very real and i'm not making it up at all. i created a new account in hopes of not being recognized as this is turning into a very tricky situation. my brother and i are both very overwhelmed at the moment and we're in a bit if a situation where we aren't exactly sure who we can trust.  as far as my  motive behind mentioning my mother's invention...evidently that was precieved as making this entire thing seem like a made up story. all i can tell you is, sorry i didn't disclose that in a manner which made it more believable for you. i guess i'm poorly communicating the events i've been through recently and to be honest, i'm trying more so to get actual advice, not to make sure you believe me.",2

"should i (48m) tell my wife (44f) that i received a sex tape of her in the mail?. throwaway.

this is an odd thing. wife and i have been married 20 years. i've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

first of the year, i receive a package in the mail. it's a dvd addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". it's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. she was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

first i've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the dvd - none of which i know. i'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. second i've know idea why they sent it. are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? the tape isn't time stamped so i don't have a frame of reference. she kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

and also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? i know my wife had other partners. hell i had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago i think we're past that. but apparently this person or persons isn't.

the whole thing is strange. i'm not sure what's going on. i haven't told my wife, i'm not sure how she would take it. she's very sexual and adventurous but i don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. but i don't think i'll get to the bottom of this unless i tell her.

edit - update. i'm overwhelmed by the responses. thank you for your interest.

i did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. some mentioned letting her watch it in private and i gave her that option. she did and we talked at length. some of it is a bit clearer now.

the two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. that's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  i asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

the other is a boyfriend she dated when her and i met, before we actually started dating. she knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

why?

she admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on facebook. when she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. she thinks he sent the dvd to cause an issue with us.

for the first time i now have doubts. her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. and honestly i may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - i know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. also she didn't seem shaken by the dvd or the fact i had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. i had the idea she'd rather i didn't have it but now that i did, oh well. 

it still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the dvd was made in 2013 but i'm just getting it now? that many be minor but it may be everything. plus how does this gentleman know where i live - facebook doesn't give you that information. being in contact with someone does so now you see why i have doubts.

thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. i love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. i will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

edit ii - i want to clarify something. i've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that i'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. none of my business, it was 20 years ago i should man up, that sort of thing.

look, i said it was hard to take. most men understand their partner was with different people before them. but seeing their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. i didn't say i was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. it's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. i'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. and for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" i challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. frustrated at best. you won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. so thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position i'll ignore you thank you very much .

final edit - this will be my final edit. thank you all for your support but all i will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. i hacked into my wife's facebook account - childish and immature i'll admit but i did it nonetheless. and i found things disturbing enough that i need to think long and hard about what i do next. i've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and i'm questioning her more than ever before. heartbroken is putting it mildly. it's time for me to work on my life and my self. thanks to everyone and their interest .",8
"for being cold to my ex-fiance and demanding a paternity test after her infidelity?. so, right now i'm in kinda a shitty situation. i've been treating my ex-fiance pretty cold and demanding a paternity test for the child she's caring. all of my friends are saying i'm being a major asshole but i don't feel that way, heres the story.

i knew my ex for almost 10 years. we go back all the way to high school and have been friends. after we graduated i said fuck it and asked her out and we became a couple. we dated for almost 6 years before she came to me and told me she was pregnant. i won't lie, i loved her at the time and this was actually quite exciting to me so i proposed. she, however, seemed super worried. i sat down and talked with her about it. i told her that even if she did decide to terminate the pregnancy i would be by her side and still wanted to marry her. she was super awkward about it but decided to keep the child and accepted my proposal.

these past 7 months have been a roller coaster. she moved in with me and we began getting ready for our daughters birth and we were planning on getting married after she is born. that was until a few weeks ago. an old acquaintance from high school reached out to me. i was never good friends with him but he said that he felt guilty about letting an innocent man suffer for his and my ex's mistakes. this guy claimed that he was the father of my ex's child and that my ex had been lying to me. it turns out that my ex and him got reacquainted about a year ago and started having sex. around the time my ex got pregnant they began having unprotected sex. he is not lying about this. he sent me photos of them together and showed me texts between the two of them. i was able to get my ex's phone and confirmed they were real. along with this, he sent me a string of facebook messages of my ex admitting to lying to me because i make more money that the real father and she would rather i care for it.

suffice to say, i was fucking pissed. i confronted her, she cried, i cried, it was a mess. in the end i broke it off then and there and evicted her from my apartment. she's in the process of moving out now but i have not said a single word to her. i have pretty much told her that i want her out of my life. i also demanded a dna test the minute the child is born. if it is mine, i'll help her support it. if not, then i am never seeing her again.

i've been cold to her. her and her parents has tried multiple times to ""work it out"" with me but i've refused any contact with them. at one point she got all of her friends together to try to talk to me and i kicked them out of the apartment with threats of calling the police. any time she's tried to ""reconcile"" i've shut it down,

my friends are saying i'm in wrong here. according to them she's pregnant and because of that i should at least be helping her till the baby is born even if it isn't mine. i disagree fully. but i could be wrong. am i letting my own emotions hide the fact from me that i'm an asshole?",3
"update i 25m got ghosted by my girlfriend 23f of 2 years.. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvawkw/i_25m_got_ghosted_by_my_girlfriend_23f_of_2_years/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

thanks everyone for your support. i actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. i didn't know she'd be there. she said hi to me like nothing was the matter. like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. she looked great and i wish i hadn't gone to the party. i was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. but seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

after the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. she said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when i was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. just like that. she said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). she said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

i said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. she apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. she said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

i just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. so she just decided pretending i didn't exist was the best way to do it. 

i can't say hearing all this helps. i don't really even have much closure. but people wanted me to update and so i did.

thanks for all your help guys. wish it was more interesting than it really was.",8

"for making a girl cry by calling her fat when she was roasting me for being skinny?. context: so a couple of girls in my college friend group have a roommate called ""jan"". i am acquainted with her and we never really had any problems, we actually made quite a good beer pong duo. i'm a tall and lanky male at 6'1 and 155lbs. jan is a white chick on the heavier-side.


recently, we had a watch party at jan's apartment for the michigan football bowl game where our friends were all having a good time getting pretty tipsy. my buddy and i were talking about whether our qb should declare for the draft or return. i said ""i sure hope he comes back, dylan (our backup qb) is still young and is still pretty scrawny."" 

jan has a huge crush on dylan and didn't appreciate that i called him skinny. 

this caused her to go on a drunken tirade saying ""what makes you think that you can call him skinny when you're literally built of twigs?"" ""you would die playing football. tbh i don't think you could even lift a helmet!"" 

at first, i took it on the chin, had a chuckle about it, and poked back a bit. i usually got my leg pulled about my physique but i never took it personally. until she started making it personal.

""look at you, you're like one of those starving african kids on those tv commercials""  (i'm brown but not african)
""that's why dylan is a chick-magnet and my ex dumped you. you look malnourished""

she kept going and now i was beginning to boil. i wasn't even responding at this point, just biting my tongue. but then i snapped.

her: ""go lift some weights. it's okay no one will judge you if you can only curl 5 pounds.""

me: ""if you could tell me what your current diet is, i'm sure i'll put on weight in no time.""

*silence*

her: ""what are you trying to say?""

me: ""i'm saying that if i'm a malnourished african then you could be on the biggest loser. and i'm pretty certain you wouldn't win.""

her: ""no wonder ex didn't want you. go fuck yourself.""

me: ""and no guy wants you. the last dick you got was moby dick. fucking whale.""

at this point she was in tears, make-up running and everything. her chick friends helped her into a bedroom to comfort her while looking back at me with a death glare.

since this was at jan's place, i figured i should leave (michigan was getting slaughtered at this point anyways). i finished my beer and left. i got a facetime from one of my friends who is jan's roommate. she urged me to apologize because she was just playing around and i went too far. i didn't feel that way and i don't want to apologize.

am i the asshole?

"for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?. ok this is the worst. i'm losing sleep over this.

i'm getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and i cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

my brother is gay, but my family doesn't know, only me and my parents know. i come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century's mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

so my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, i'm so happy my brother found a great guy. but it's kind of a secret, as he hasn't told my family he is gay.

i've been telling him for years that he should come out, cause i know it stresses him a lot, and i think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus i bet a few family members already know anyway.

but he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won't accept it and it will be a lot of drama. i see the opposite, i see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. i have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn't accept my brother being gay.

anyway, that's his decision not mine, so for now he won't say anything.

until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. i was not expecting that to be honest. so he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

if it was any other occasion i would be supportive obviously, but i don't think my wedding day is the day to do that.  imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. and i don't want to get the attention away from my fiancee, that's her day. and i dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and i think it's a pretty good reason

i asked him why my wedding day, he said it's because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. this is killing me. i would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if i had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and i can't do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

i didn't even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

with a heavy heart, i asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that i hope he understands me. he  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

next day i got a text and he said "" dont worry, going alone"". i tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don't seem to know what's happening because they didn't say anything.

he eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

this is the worst situation of my life, am i the asshole for handling it the way i did?

ps 1: i wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

ps 2: thanks for the gold and stuff!

update: spoke to fiancee, couldn't keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

clarification: i know it won't be my brother that would cause trouble. the trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. doesn't matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.i don't want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. literally every other day of my life i will support my brother's decision to come out. even at the wedding, i would obviously defend him. but the point is, not at the wedding. also, my brother is not the asshole. not at all.",3

"suicidal best friend checked herself into a facility while she recovers. she requested i take care of her children (1m 3f). her family took them instead against her wishes. (ut). my best friend is a single mom. the other day she had a mental breakdown and became suicidal. she has made an attempt on her life in the past years and years ago and knew if she didn't get help immediately, she would kill herself, and so she went directly to the emergency room. she has been moved to a behavioral health unit while she recovers mentally and is ready to go home.

she has requested that i take care of her children while she is gone. we are very close and her children love me. she trusts me completely with them. we have plans to move in together in soon. i am not a parent, but i have the means to take care of them and they would be happy.

i received an unnanounced visit from some of her family members (grandmother and cousin). they wanted to watch the children for a little bit. i was fine with this as i wanted to visit my friend to see how she was doing and stock up on food and supplies for the children. my friend was very upset that i let her cousin watch her children and requested i pick them up as soon as possible. she has always had difficulty with trusting her family and didn't want her cousin parenting her children.

her family doesn't want to return the children to me. they claim they are worried about child protective services stepping in. they believe/claim if the children are found in custody of a friend rather than family member that the children would be taken as custody of the state.

what can i do in this case? her children are in no way neglected and would be completely safe and cared for by me. i have taken time off work and will be with them 24/7. she even wants the children to be with me and not them. does her will not matter to cps? would they actually take the children if found in care from a non family member? or would i be completely fine caring for her children?

**edit: i have received a lot of great advice. thank you! i will be going to get the children asap. many of you suggested getting the delegation of parental authority completed. i can attempt to do so but she is only allowed an hour of visitation per day. she also has no idea what is currently happening with her children and with her mental state i am worried of giving her extra stress knowing that i am having difficulty getting them back. should i continue to have difficulty, i will have to get her to help with getting the documents signed. i would like to keep this as peaceful with her family as possible, which it has been so far. i understand their concern about cps and i'm hoping that the advice i receive will help convince them that they have no need to be worried and cps won'tbe an issue. should i show them my home and that i am 100% capable of caring for the children to alleviate their concerns?**

**edit 2: i have the children back. i talked with their mother on the phone and she assured me cps was a non-issue. she even insured that her family were not listed as caregivers, and another close friend of hers is. her friend is with me in this and believes i am fully fit to have them. still facing a lot of opposition towards me having them and i'm working through getting the proper paperwork signed.**

"my (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before i get married.. my fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. we decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. everything was going great. he seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

i am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and i wasn't fussed so i agreed to saving it. he has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. i laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. no turns out he was dead serious. he wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know i am still 'pure'.

i told him fat chance i am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. he said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much i love him and that i have nothing to hide anyway as i am still a virgin. i left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

i want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. but at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and i dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

"by going for a walk and accidentally traumatising a woman for life. obligatory ""happened a few years ago etc"" but basically there was this walking/bike path near my house that i would occasionally walk along for exercise.

sometimes, while walking, i'd set myself a personal goal, like ""reach that pole by the end of this song"" or whatever (i listened to music while i walked).

well, one time i saw someone walking in front of me. they were a considerable distance ahead of me, but i decided that my goal that night was to overtake them by the time i reached my turnaround point.

so i started walking faster to catch up and overtake them, and realised it was a woman. at the time i didn't think anything of it, because, hey, we're both on the same walking path for the same reason; getting healthy.

as i slowly yet surely got closer to her, i noticed she would occasionally turn her head and look behind her. i'd had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, i only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, i'd turn around and look behind me, because i thought she may have heard a bike bell that i hadn't heard over my music. meanwhile i kept my speed up because i was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.

near to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it's of course here that i finally catch up with her..

as i get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what i can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). aimed directly at me.

i immediately realise what i've done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).
i gave her the most awkward smile in the world while i powerwalked past her, walked wayy past my turnaround point so i could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.

as an added ""bonus"", i later learned that there was a notorious rapist named ""the bike path rapist"" that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.

"my mom kicked me out. she tried to get the people i was staying with areasted (by lying to law enforcement), when that didn't work she tried to get me in psych ward. i'm happy where i am now but she's trying to get me back.. i'm 17 and live in ontario canada. my mom is abusive and mentally ill. she kicked me out, told me to ""call your grandparents, or i'm giving you to dad"", my dad lives 20 hours away and is a physically abusive alcoholic. time passes and my aunt picks me up. then after a day of staying with her and my grandma police show up at the door. they apparently kidnapped me i guess. mom said my grandma smokes cannabis and i'm in an unsafe environment. thing is my grandma is on oxygen and is actually allergic to cannabis (it's also not even illegal anymore), so the officer leaves without any worry of my safety. next day two officers show up, my mom apparently went to a ""justice of the peace"" and swarm in that i was danger to myself and others. i get put in the back of a cruiser, i have a genuinely nice conversation with the officer and explain what's going on. told i'm a ""respectful, smart, and mature kid. this kind of stuff happens more often than you think"" we get to the hospital and i wait for 4 hours in triage. i talk to the psychiatrist and basically get screened and sent home in 5 minutes. my mom has since then filed a missing persons case on me, continuously tried to contact me, talked about messing up my class schedule with the principal. is there anything i can do to get her to leave me alone?

"by ejaculating in my bed. throwaway obviously. this is a few months old but i feel like i have to get it out of my head.

so i know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but i've always done it in bed. i am living with my parents so i guess i just like the privacy of my room. then - and this is what i now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time i would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. i never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so i just kept doing it because it was easy... nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.

after some years of doing this i recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. i used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that's why it didn't smell?) but for a couple of weeks i started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. this usually wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since i was always ejaculating on my wall/bed i began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. 

i didn't notice at first and since i've never had cockroaches before i didn't really know what they were but eventually i read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... at first i felt really disgusted. i wanted to exterminate them but i definitely didn't want my parents to find out what happened, so i tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. but then i felt really bad.



i don't know why but it felt like murder. i didn't really dislike the cockroaches. i had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. so i decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point i finally began masturbating in the shower). i know this sounds really weird but i kind of began thinking of them as my children. it started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. i actually want kids when i grow up. and this was kind of like that - i used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and i just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.



then my parents found out. i think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while i was at school. 



so we had to move out for about a week to an airbnb and i was really depressed the entire time but i couldn't tell them why. they thought i just didn't like the airbnb.

tl;dr i jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation",4

"by receiving 2nd degree burns on my butthole.. so this happened roughly about 4 hours ago. insert generic ""i'm on mobile"" text here. 

so i was getting ready for work and stepping out of the shower.
i don't know about you guys, but i really like to use a hair dryer on
every part of my body. i've got hair all over my body, so it makes sense i guess.

i use the hairdryer to dry my (head) hair, then my torso and then my legs... and then...
my butt. you see, i'm a guy and there's some hair down there. it's not always
easy to dry it with a towel so i just use the hair dryer. 

i would get out of the shower, use a towel to dry myself as much as possible 
and then let the hair dryer do the rest.

for the last 10 years this technique has worked perfectly fine.. except for today.

you see, somehow my hands were still wet. for some reason i didn't notice this. so
while i was spreading my butt cheeks to dry the hair between them the hair dryer slipped
out of my hand. i quickly cought the power cable but by doing that the hair dryer was rammed
directly between my buttcheeks while it was still on.

the hair dryer was on the highest setting and the moment it hit my butthole i was shocked.
i instantly clenched my buttcheeks together while the hairdryer was still in there and running.

god, i can't tell you how much this fucking hurt. it still does. it's literally the worst pain.
like, i know the anus is relatively sensitive but this was just pure hell. the pain was so horrible
i was literally unable to loosen my butt cheeks. the hairdryer was blowing hot, and i mean hot air directly on my butthole
for about 7 full seconds. i managed to get my shit together and pull the plug.

but by the time i pulled the plug the damage was already done. i fell on the floor and puked all over
the place. the pain was unbearable. i was crying, screaming and i think i even might've passed out for
a couple of seconds at a time.

i was laying on my bathroom floor for 30 miniutes trying to somehow live through this immeasurable pain.

it was horrible. but after half an hour of laying there i realized i had to move, this had to be treated, so i tried to reach for my phone to call help. but when i tried to crawl to my phone i realized that the hair dryer was still
between my butt cheeks!

so i tried to pull it out and that was the second time i puked due to the pain. when i got it out it was covered
in bloody/burnt off parts of my butt's flesh. i have no clue how it looks down there but it can't be any better than
how i'm feeling right now.

i eventually managed to call my girlfriend. she drove me to the hospital.

so... that's basically it. i'm currently laying in a hospital bed. the wound has been 'treated'. it was so humiliating.
the pain is still horrible but they gave me painkillers so i guess that'll help.
this is literally the worst day of my life. i've not only felt the worst pain you can imagine, i've also never been
more embarrassed/ashamed.

but i really have to give credit to the nurses/doctor who treated me. they did perfect. they tried to cheer me up
and they were totally nice. i'm so grateful.

also, i really hope i could explain this properly but if you had problems here's a visual depiction of what went down:

"assisted suicide should be available to all above the age of 18 for free, but with a twist. basic idea:
- aviable to everyone above 18 years of age
- free
but:
- one has to go through a ""resocialization"" program
- programm tries to re-establish the will to live, through learning new skills, finding work, meeting people, etc 
-> fixing the person's problems

if after 6 months no ""resocialization"" is reached, the person will get the assisted suicide

a much needed edit:
- the time limit has been selected ""randomly"" and is a placeholder
- the ""resocialization"" programms goal is to get the person into a state of willingness to live, by solving the person's problems, be it by therapy or some other way
- the free aspect seems to irritate some people who don't want to fund it with their tax, how about funding it with the taxes from rich people/corporations instead?

"by swallowing my little sister's birthday present. i am so beside myself with shame that i almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

but reddit karma is my mistress and i must heed her sweet call. 

so yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), i was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

now, i cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. i looked at that ring in my hand and i just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a bugs bunny cartoon. my primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

so i did it.

i think it was the next split second when i saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that i realized what a horrible mistake i had made. 

so my little sister runs screaming from my room and i hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as i admitted that i, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. no, i didn't know why i did it. yes, i am an idiot. no one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

so brief intermission from my sister's birthday as i make a quick excursion to the er, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them i was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. they took a couple x-rays and i hung around the er for about 8 hours before they broke the news that i was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

i shat out the ring this morning. 

happy birthday sis. 

tl;dr: i am an idiot and i ate my sister's ring because i thought it would be funny.

"by mistaking my coffee thermos for my wife's.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but happened a while back.

&#x200b;

so for christmas, my wife got her and me matching coffee thermoses. hers was copper tinted, mine was stainless steel. apart from that they were identical. i loved it! but after a while, being the absent minded person that i am, mine goes missing. ""no biggie"", i said to myself, ""my wife is staying home today, i'll just take her thermos to work."" so i fixed me up a nice thermos full of black coffee, and headed out the door to work.

this particular day was rather busy, and i had meetings back to back pretty much all morning. i had my thermos and laptop in tow, and was migrating from one conference room to another, when i realized i needed to run to the urination station. so i dropped off my laptop and thermos, ran and relieved myself, then stopped back by my cubical to pick up a couple of reports for the meeting.

while sorting the papers at my desk, i reach over and grab for my thermos and take a big swig of coffee. immediately, a few alarms and thoughts went through my head. ""this coffee got pretty cold pretty fast today...that's odd. also i don't remember putting any cream or sugar in it this morning...that's odd. also what is this texture??""

at this point, still mid-gulp, i shift my eyes down to the top of the thermos, which has a clear plastic lid, and i notice a very large floating blob of mold, which i had just taken a sizable chunk out of. also i notice the thermos is stainless steel, not copper colored.this was my coffee that had been sitting on my computer desk, in plain sight, for a month. oh no...i thought as i immediately reach for the trashcan to try and lurch the coffee back out, but to my disappointment it would not come back up. so i run to the bathroom and try a full on puking position to try and get it back up, again no luck. i just knew i was going to get deathly ill, but actually i didn't get sick beyond the mental stress of having just consumed an entire family of slimy, chunky mold spores and rotten cream.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: took my thermos to work, forgot about it. took my wife's to work a few weeks later. accidentally drank from my month old coffee and got a nice dose of penicillin and rotten cream.

"(update) school wants my son's facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. wtf? florida. this is an update to this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

i went to school and asked what's going on. i did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

first, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. second, the principal explained the situation to me. it had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

when i asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. i asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

i told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. i told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat i'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

i talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. he only knew that she had left the school. he showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

in short: they backed off after i made sure they understood that i won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. i will try talking to them to make sure. they deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at.

so last night my girlfriend and i decided to go out to the bars. got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. well last night was the first time we decided to use them. we read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. everything went well but afterwards we couldn't find the plug. this is where the begins. 

we figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. gfs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she's a little extra hungover no big deal. we arrive at mcds to get some greasy hangover food. i order while gf heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. as i take our order back to our table, gf walks over in a panic saying we need to leave now.

she found the butt plug. in our drunken state, we managed to put the entire thing in her ass. handle and all. and now it's sitting at the bottom of a mcdonalds toilet in all its glory.

"update: today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from. delaware, usa

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

i found the fence on thursday. saturday i was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. so on friday morning, i had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. i called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

i took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

i also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. if i find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, i'll be informing the police.

so, on friday afternoon, i removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which i put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. saturday, sunday, and monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

we still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now i don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. i will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if i learn who built the fence i will be sure to update again!",2

so, i have just returned from lunch, where my wife received her new bands.  we kept it low key, no pictures/video, and semi-private.  what we did was planned to take her cut band to a local jeweler after lunch, and invited our two sons to lunch before the ""appointment"".  while ordering, oldest son asks to see the damaged/cut wedding band, saying he might be able to fix it, he takes it below the table and starts acting like he is squeezing and straining, and then places a complete ""fixed"" band on the table, and asks his mom if that works, she is astounded, and places the band on her finger, but....it is too big.  youngest son says he can fix that and asks for the band, wife reluctantly and with a look of ""wtf is going on"" on her face, hands the band to our youngest, he takes it below the table, and squeezes and strains, and makes it ""smaller, but not quite perfect"" when she puts it on.  she is now trying to figure it out, and as she takes it off and starts to inspect it, i take it away from her and do the same ""act"" as our boys, but this time, the band fits perfectly on her finger, and she has quite literally had enough!  she finally takes it off, and is inspecting it pretty hard, and cannot figure it out.....until my oldest places her cut and older band on the table, our youngest places the too large band on the table, and i place the next size on the table.  at this point she's just staring at all of us, and i explain what had happened, and how i was able to find the jeweler, etc.  i even showed her the reddit post.  she didn't start crying until reading about the comments and all the caring and support you guys posted.  lunch was ordered, we all talked about everything, ate lunch as a family, parted ways back to respective work, home, etc.

she (wife) did mention that after reading all the replies, she would have killed me if i had gone full public display, and all that, so very thankful to those that suggested to keep it low key and semi-private.

so, about the jeweler.  they responded to my email regarding posting the name/info, and would like to maintain their privacy.  the oldest son is making jewelry and doing repairs only to catch up previous orders and work requests prior to their fathers passing.  once it is all caught up, they are closing it for good.  they sent copies of the drawings and mold for our bands and we placed them in our safe at home in case this happens again, we can get something made/designed.  i followed up asking if there was any way to repay their kindness, and haven't had a response.  regardless, my wife is planning on hitting up some local spots and making them a ""texan"" gift package and sending it to them.

and that's it.  she is extremely happy and overjoyed.  i am really glad it's ""over"" as i had no idea this would garner this much attention, and can now go back to our normal lives.  thanks to everyone for their suggestions, and we are grateful to all the outpouring of genuine caring, thank you to everyone that sent silver, gold, and platinum, it wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated.

***edit - i keep reading comments about the jewelers, and this being fake.  the daughter, son, and an uncle are all working part time to finish work that was commissioned prior to their fathers passing.  from what was explained to me, none of them were, are, or plan to be in the jewelry business.  so, take that however you want, i have tried to be as genuine as possible, and have zero reason to be dishonest.  i really do feel sorry for the cynical way some people live life.  follow the old adage ""if you can't say something nice.....""

after driving for about an hour, i miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped two of my tires. i'm in a shitty ghetto town that i've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how i'm getting home now. i thought i was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. but since there was no turning back now, i decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

the husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as i see him, my gut and inner voice are screaming at me, don't do this, turn back. and i wish i had listened. for reasons unknown, i followed him into the house. it was pitch black, not a single light was on. he lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. i was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. if there was ever a time i disassociated, it was then and there. it was no longer me behind the wheel. the dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. does anybody remember the scene in blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? that was what i saw. a disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. i was horrified but at the same time, i didn't care. they both fucking stink, that was one of the worst things. the smell took forever to wash off my hands after. months later i'll get a whiff out of nowhere. that disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

i take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking the entire time, like fucking gollum. saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. look at that beautiful pussy. ain't she so fuckin wet?"" nonstop. meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. like i said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, i managed to perform to a degree but i never did finish. it probably didn't help i was wearing a condom but i'm extremely glad i was. the entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""how the fuck am i getting home? this smell is going to kill me. how do i end this? how do i get out of here?""

i decided it was time, i had to get the fuck out of there asap. i told them i couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. they insisted i put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. i just wanted to make it look like i at least tried. if the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. i pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. i stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. i politely reiterated i wasn't going to be able to finish. i blamed it on my tires being popped and i was too tired. they were cool about it, and i quickly gathered my things and left.

i barely had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. so we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. my hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers i took and how many times i washed them. i blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what i did. it took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200b;

tldr; drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

&#x200b;

edit: i'm really glad i was able to make a lot of you laugh, even if it's at my own expense, i'm laughing with you. a lot of you have kind things to say and it means quite a lot, thank you. i hope anybody that can relate to the self destructive mindset finds happiness.",4
"update: private driveway being used as public roadway and im being accessed for its upkeep. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d2ubd8/private\_driveway\_being\_used\_as\_public\_roadway\_and/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d2ubd8/private_driveway_being_used_as_public_roadway_and/)

raised hell with the county commissioner for my district, showed them video and threatened to lawyer up, he pulled in the director for the road and bridge department then pulled in the director of zoning and planning.

my driveway is no longer a road and i am no longer being assessed for repairs and i am legally allowed to do what is necessary to stop traffic from crossing my property so both sides of the property have been ditched and bermed and a steel pole gate across the side i plan on keeping open. sheriffs dept has been out multiple times dealing with people trying to enter the property but they are starting to get the hint that road is closed.

we are currently in negotiations for a portion of my property to be purchased and turned into a road but not 10 feet from my house, there is a county commissioners meeting next tuesday and it is on the docket to be brought up.

&#x200b;

my driveway is no longer on google maps as a road, signage posted private property no trespassing, dead end road, etc etc etc. several people are angry about it as they are used to the pass-through but with the cameras i have installed i've been able to get clear images of vehicles and license plates of the worst offenders and they will be cited according to the sheriffs dept.

&#x200b;

i have contacted amazon and ups about their trucks crossing my property, ups has instructed their drivers to no longer use that route, haven't heard a thing back from amazon yet but i have stopped two of their trucks so far,both of which were ticketed by the sheriffs dept and the one needing a tow to get pulled off the berm it got stuck on.

thank you all of you for the suggestions, hopefully soon this will all be over and i can get on with my life.",2
"i 32m make significantly more money than my new girlfriend 26f and it's causing problems. hi everyone. long time lurker, first time poster. this may just be a problem i'm identifying in my head, and i know you all are good at cutting through bullshit, so hopefully you can help.

i'm an anesthesiologist in washington, d.c. and make over 300k a year. consequently, i live a comfortable life and, while i have a significant amount of medical school debt, am pretty financially stable for the foreseeable future. i'm glad to spend a little more than most would on special dinner, gifts, and things, because i'm pretty much guaranteed this salary for the rest of my career.

my gal works at a nonprofit and makes 55k a year. she's a bit of a penny pincher, happy to spend money on trips and dining out, but budgets religiously and tracks every penny she spends. 

we've been dating for about four months now, and it's going really well. i love spending time with her.

the issue is, i think she's uncomfortable with how much money i make. whenever i take her on a date, i insist on paying for everything. this makes perfect sense to me, because money i spend to take her out is a drop in the ocean, but for her it would probably add up. but she sometimes doesn't let me or doesn't want me to pay. she'll insist on splitting the bill, or if i pay, she'll try and pay the next time we hang out. i've told her time and time again that i'm more than happy to pay for things, spending time with her makes me happy, and so i'd be glad to drop a couple hundred bucks a month on dinners, drinks, movies, etc. but she always insists that ""she can pay her own way"" and ""she doesn't need to be taken care of."" 

one time she had to miss a flight to visit a friend. it was nonrefundable and she was out $300. when she was complaining to me about it, i immediately offered to give her the $300 back, just so she wouldn't feel bad about losing the money, but she rejected me and said she just needed to vent. 

it's not really a problem in the grand scheme of things, i just think it's silly that she spends money on me when i make more in a year what she'll make in five. and like i said, i'm happy to treat her.

any thoughts on how to navigate this? i especially would like to hear from people in relationships with huge income differences. 

tl;dr i make a lot more money that gf, but she won't let me pay for things.",8
"update: for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?. og post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)

it's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and i guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!

in my last post, i stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. at this point, i would like to clarify that my family and i are chinese and it is common in chinese culture to ""disown"" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. however, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. his business was a passion project on the side. my dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)

alrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. despite the chain of advice i sent her, she ignored me still. i regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. i was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then i received a call from my parents!!! according to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. she had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. my mom was very tearful as well. they scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and i believe she went in the next day.

i had no idea what made her finally break and return home so i texted her (first, i told her i was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. at first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. lmao. what a fucking asshole. glad my sister finally returned to her senses. she told me she broke it off with him and i sincerely hope that's the truth.

this past monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. according to my mom, she was begging that they do is asap, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.

the future seems pretty bright right now for her. my parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and i think it'd be great for her). she's officially starting next monday. i'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)

tl;dr: sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and mcdonald's. sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.

edit: forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. i urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",3
"update my (28f) boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) are going on a week-long vacation. they uninvited me.. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/copzwa/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_and_his_best_friend_29f_are/)

update, as promised.

i was really upset the day i dropped him off and he was texting me but i wasn't responding. i wasn't sure what i wanted to do, but i didn't want to do anything at all in the state i was in. i waited until the next day, and then i sent him a thought out text letting him know that i didn't feel safe or loved in the way the trip was handled and that i would be dropping his things off at his place and leaving his keys with the neighbor. he called but didn't leave any messages and then he messaged me that he didn't understand.

the rest of the week, he called and messaged me, but i couldn't bring myself to pick up or text back. on thursday, i think that he realized that i was serious, and he asked me some questions about logistical things — i told him which neighbor his key was with, etc.

when he got back and saw all his things at his place, he got pretty frantic and called and left me a long message. i was working all day, but also i still didn't want to respond. he asked me to explain because he didn't understand what was going on. the next day, i sent another text making it clear that it was over, and he got upset and sent me a bunch of texts in a row about how he didn't understand why i was throwing away everything that we built. he left me a voicemail that was really angry that said he had no idea why i was upset and that he did not accept the break-up because he had no say in it and that he wanted me to tell him the evil story that i had made up about him to his face.

i wasn't going to respond to him and i wanted to remain calm, but this upset me. so i sat down to write him this letter. it's long, so skip over if you want. i tried to call him but i started crying and told him i'd just send him an email instead. this is what it said.

""the time that we have had apart has given me some good space and time to think. i have had a chance to think about the things that are important for me in a relationship and i see that we should not be together. i am sorry that i have been asking for you to change things about your life that you shouldn't have to change at my or anyone's behest.

from the very start, this trip was made in an insanely disrespectful way in which it started out from you being given an ultimatum by your female best friend who i had never met that either she goes or i go on this trip, and you picked her. you didn't offer to have her meet me (theoretically i was your long-term partner, so this would have made a lot of sense), you didn't encourage her to find someone else to come, and you didn't consult me at all. that's enough for most people to have a deal-breaker, right there. however, i stayed.

this is a person who you have a history with that is not entirely clear to me. here is what i understand: some bad rumors got started about the two of you in which you spent an entire night out with her on an acid trip while you were dating someone else. nothing happened. the other thing i understand is that you were interested in her romantically at some, theoretically other, point and that she started dating her boyfriend and that closed the door on things for you. according to what i also understand, it took a long time for 29f's boyfriend to feel comfortable with you being around, but you apparently worked to ultimately make him feel comfortable with you after i'm not sure how long. this is the completely unknown person who shut me out of a trip that i was originally going to go on (unilateral decision). you did not tell me this was happening until i asked when the trip to hawaii would be.

you purchase tickets in another very disrespectful situation in which i have cooked dinner and have guests present, and you choose to go into my room for well over an hour to select tickets with her, and in which i repeatedly ask you to please come to dinner because you say it will just be a few more minutes each time. there is absolutely no reason for doing it at that time and in that situation, seeing as how she is in the same time zone as us and has a 9-5 job. this makes me feel sick to my stomach.

so, to make myself feel better about this whole arrangement, i tell you that i want to meet this person. on my request, we arrange a trip to go meet her and her boyfriend — a brief trip in which they are (and you explicitly agree) inexplicably cold. the first conversation that we have is one in which 29f and her boyfriend argue about how she dm'ed him while he was already in a relationship and got him to date her instead. you tell me about conversations that 29f has had with you recently in which it seems implied that there is some real instability in their long-term relationship — stuff about kids and dogs. i have a discussion in which i let you know that i see that and that it worries me. 

meanwhile, i am still wanting all of this to work out for you and for me and for her. i, at this point, am planning on being with you for the long term and see no benefit in telling you to not go on a trip with your best friend. i want it to work out. but each and every interaction surrounding this trip chips and chips and chips away at my ability to handle it: the conversations that seem to go nowhere, etc. your dad, your mom, and your grandparents are all very surprised when we tell them about this trip. it is becoming very obvious that this is a dangerous trip to make with the fragility of our relationship. 29m, we had only been together for nine months. how long did it take before 29f's boyfriend was comfortable with you hanging around? much less going on a one-on-one international tropical vacation in which he was uninvited because of your request?

we go over it with (friend) at the rock climbing gym, we go over it in the car, we go over it while we're booking our airbnb for copenhagen, we go over it when i tell you that i still feel uncomfortable and i do not feel good about the trip. talk about repeatedly saying something! although i ask for you to help me, you actually ask me instead to come up with what would make me feel better. surprisingly, i have no ideas either. 

ultimately, it appears that the original plan to meet at my place and hang out and do a game night before you two go on the trip has been canceled, and 29f will be staying at my place, but not hanging out with us at all beforehand. you attribute it to you not bringing it up with her early enough. this is apparently not something that was discussed even two nights before the trip. this upsets me. you do not know what to do. i don't blame you — at this point, it was well out of hand. i don't know what to do either. there is no good solution that i can think of besides waiting for the trip to be over. i tell you that either i have to get over it, or i have to break up with you, and that i don't want to break up with you. but my ability to get over it is rather rather rather worn down. 

she arrives at my place very late, and we wake up the next morning for me to take the two of you to the airport. after all of this lead-up, i know that you can tell how unhappy i am. i fully absolutely know you can tell how unhappy i am. you leave, and when i don't respond to your text messages, you text me to tell me that you hope i'm okay and you're going to bed. no call.

the rest of the week was rough. my text to you was met with, essentially, ""i'm sorry you feel this way."" you tell me that i'm being unfair.

there is no acknowledgment (and there still has been none) that this trip to a fucking honeymoon destination, as we have discussed before, could be a crazy and horrible thing to go through with, even with my quasi-blessing. this is not something that people in relationships have to deal with. this is not something that people in relationships do, besides 29f, i guess.

in the end, all of this is to say that i have felt serious emotional needs go seriously unmet in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.

there have been some wonderful, very positive times, but there has been an unnecessary amount of heartache and suffering for me over things that come down to what i can only assume are personal differences.

i cannot handle your relationship with 29f. and i suppose i could ask you to pick between her and me, but that's not what i want to do. i want you to have your best friend, and i want to leave. i did love you, but i am not about to fight this fight and hear you tell me that i'm crazy for not seeing how totally platonic everything is for the rest of my life.

it seems like trying to convince someone to like different food, or to have a different favorite color. i am not happy in this, and i do not want to feel these feelings any longer.

there is no need for this to be mutual. i do not need your permission to break up with you.""

he wrote me back an apologetic email in which he accepted responsibility for most things without any argument, except he denied anything that had to do with his relationship with her making me feel uncomfortable and he denied that i would not be able to handle their relationship.

he said that the only thing that made their trip bad for me was my own perspective.

i wrote him back that trust has to be built and that he put too much strain too early on a relationship in which we had not developed that trust.

he agreed and apologized. for me, it ended on a pretty amicable note, but this style of relationship really doesn't work for me and i don't feel like his responses to me really healed or changed anything significantly. i stand by my decision at this point.

tldr: we broke up.",8

"when using the shower head to masturbate. alrighty it's now the morning after;  i am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won't stop laughing at me. 

last night hubby & i had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. 

as usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. one of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know 😉

as a 35 year old woman i had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. sure, i have toys (i'm no prude) but i had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. 

the night ended and we went home. smelling of the bonfire i tell hubby i'm having a shower & he says he doesn't care, he's going to bed. 

i should admit i was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an uber in case anyone's concerned we drove under the influence). 

i'm washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. ok, imma try the shower head... 

ok feels good but need more pressure.. 

ok feels better but i could still use more pressure.. 

ohh ok that's just right. yeah that's the spot... oh yeah that's the spot!!!!! 

...screaming: ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! 

just as i was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. i slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as i managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. 

hubby came running in and i'm telling you it was a fucking sight. 

i'm planked from the shower across the toilet (in like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while i'm crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. 

i fucked up y'all. 

it takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that's ever happened. 

i managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. lucky.

anyway we went to the ed because i did have a few decent cuts but i only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. again, lucky. 

i told the nurse & doctor that i slipped while cleaning the shower. you know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. 

i'll be telling our landlord the same thing today. 

tl;dr went to town on myself with the shower head, as i orgasmed i slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ed for a few stitches.

edit: changed the tldr for u/nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate

edit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. thanks for the awards too. 

to answer the biggest question: i was embarrassed and panicked when i said i was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying i slipped. stupid i know, but none of us are perfect. 

to all the men jealous of the female clit, just remember you can pee anywhere with ease and we can't so you've got that 😂

to the people who criticized my writing style, my overuse of the word hubby, who think i'm a man, who slid into my dms just to slut shame me & tell me off- fucking hell just get over it and scroll on by. i'm not responding to anyone who attacks me, it's pretty sad you've got nothing better to do than bring negativity where it's just not needed. 

i've also learnt that the shower head seems to be the most common way for us females to get off and i've learnt a lot about how to do it safely so thank you!",4
"for choosing my brother over my marriage?. my parents divorced when i was 3, and went into separate marriages. i had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. when i was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. i had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. my mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. my father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. obviously my family is morning, and i've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

the only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and i'm not going to let that happen. i told my wife that i was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. she did not take it well and is furious that i would choose my brother over her. i doubt my marriage will survive, but i can't let my brother go into foster care.

"for telling my wife that when/if she quits her job to be a sahm i am not planing to do much in the way of household chores anymore?. my wife and i have a 6 month old baby girl and a two year old boy. wife hasn't been too happy since returning to her job from her last maternity leave and i actually just got a new job. 

at my old job i was working 45-50 hours a week. at my new job my hours fluctuate a lot — it can be anywhere from 60 to 80ish hours a week at the worst. i make a lot more though so there's that. the pay raise makes it so my family can do really well on just one paycheck. my wife is ecstatic because this means she can be a sahm which is what she's wanted. 

the issue is that my wife and i aren't on the same page about what this change would mean. before, when our work hours were almost equal, we divided housework pretty much equally. we also paid a housekeeping staff to come every other week to help us out. (plus we have a nanny to care for our kids while we work). 

i told my wife that her staying home would mean no more housekeeping staff or nanny. these cuts will help us afford to have just the one income and i also think it's practical.  she was mostly agreeable to that. but then she said that we should divide the chores 50-50 still. 

i told her there was no way i was going to be taking on as many work hours as i am and then come home to cook or clean too. that would defeat the entire purpose of her quitting her job. 

she looked at me like i was some sort of neanderthal but i think what i'm saying is completely fair. i'm not expecting her to do any heavy lifting. just tending to the kids, cooking, and doing a reasonable job keeping up the house. i recognize that this would be an old fashioned way of living and if she ever wanted to return to the workforce i would support her 100%. but i think it's fair that if i'm the sole paycheck and working crazy hours i don't come home to more stress and chaos. 

obviously my wife and i will have to work this out between ourselves. i'm mainly posting here as a sanity check to see if my thoughts on this issue are completely off base. 

**edit: well this blew up since i last checked it. i can see people are really passionate about this topic and you all have encouraged me to think more deeply about it. i will read as many of the (4.2k??) comments as i can. i think i'll let my wife take a look at the thread too since many have gone out of their way to offer constructive comments for both of us.**",3
"by ingesting my bf's chemo. figured it out today, but have been fucking up for 3 weeks. 

bf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. so our sex life has stayed at our normal level. probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. 

i've been having horrible nausea and headaches. i already have anxiety so i figured i'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. 

this morning i woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. i google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. symptoms include nausea and headaches. and the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. 

i've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. 

you're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. now that i know this it seems super obvious. but uh, guess i was too horny to think it through.

tl;dr did dirty deeds with my bf's chemo dick and got sick from it

eta: thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. 

to answer as many questions as i can and also because i feel mildly defensive: he is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. there is no cure but no timeline either. we probably have a few more years. he is in excellent care at a renowned university program. we adore his team. i've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. this was not reviewed with us, only side effects. the separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. we didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. but it is mine. so all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. we're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. or they just forgot. or they figured we'd read the info. shit happens.

"a mega church next to my home plays music at high volume. i live in lawrenceville, ga and there's a mega church next to my neighborhood that plays music at volumes distinctly audible at over 400'. my wife and i have tried to speak with them to no avail and there is a paper trail of police action going back at least 4 months.

the gwinnett county statutes say that anything able to be heard by a person of reasonable hearing (i have a massive amount of hearing damage from my time overseas) over 50' is illegal unless it's construction which is 300'.

do i need to go ahead and continue to gather evidence of the hours and volume then retain a civil attorney? is this something i can take before the judge myself since even the police here have said they are flagrantly disregarding the law but can only ask them to turn it down?",2
"does everyone else day dream and use their imagination constantly throughout the day?. i personally day dream non stop. and i do mean non stop. i thought everyone else did too, but when i asked a friend how often she day dreams she gave me a weird look and said not since she was young. a second friend said something similair. i am constantly creating stories, alternate universes, and creating eloborate plans on how i would deal with a random event, like if a gunman appeared at work or if the roof collapsed on me.  and the imagining never stops, i do these things while walking to my car, peeing at a urinal, laying in bed, and obviously the entire time in the shower. am i weird or just have a bit of a childish mind still?",7
"for letting my date pay for dinner?. i 19m asked a girl 18f out to dinner. when it was time to pay, she said ""i got it"" and went into her purse. at that point i literally had the receipt thing in my hand. i thanked her and handed it to her. she hesitated a bit, but she paid and we went home happy (or so i thought).

so from my perspective i really can't see what i did wrong here. from asking her out until receiving the check, i intended to pay. after she offered to pay, i thanked her and allowed her to pay.

the next day i woke up to angry texts. she said i put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. i asked what she wanted me to do differently. apparently i should have argued/insisted that i would pay. my friends agree with her. now i'm wondering if i should just apologize and pay her back.

"by leaving my facial cleansing brush in my boyfriend's parents bathroom. this happened 2 weeks ago and i've only just stopped cringing entirely when i think about it.

my boyfriend and i were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. i took a shower, and i remember feeling really smug because i remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. for anyone that doesn't know what it is, it's literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. 

after using it, i wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when i had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. it's important to note that i had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the 'head' of it.

anyway, everything's fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and i are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for ""a word"" with my boyfriend. we both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.

after a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says ""why did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?""  obviously i was perplexed, saying i really had no idea what he was talking about. he was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as ""pink with a big bulb"" and then it hit me.

i too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as i explained what it was. unfortunately, i didn't realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. 

""you don't have to lie bloatedrabbit, it's ok but just next time don't leave it around for everyone to see.""

""i swear on my life it's a face cleanser!"" i said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. i handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. my boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he's a dirty old man for thinking like that. his dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when i think about it.

""well i'm sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother's toys!"" 


i'm not religious at all, but when i say i wanted god to beam me up there and then... i'm not kidding. i felt like jumping out the window. the whole energy of the room shifted. his dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn't dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.

worst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. my boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. talk about awkward.

tl;dr i left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend's conservative parents bathroom. his dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend's mum's toys.",4

"journalism is no longer and honest and legitimate profession, and should be treated as such.. granted, i know historically journalists have had their share of ""yellow journalism"" and other poor moments. i also know everyone's got opinions on what the ""news"" actually is -- fox, cnn, i don't care, let's put politics aside for a moment to look at other agenda-pushing bs. consider how many reputations the media has tarnished in their crusade for a headline. consider how many ""scares"" we've had because journalists take one potentially interesting tidbit from a story or a study or something and twist and twist until its a big fucking deal, when it really should have been treated as the molehill it was.

journalism is just activism in sheep's clothing. why? because juicy stories sell to the masses. journalists should be treated with the same skepticism nowadays as used car salesmen, and perhaps more so.

"for not picking my girlfriend up for a birthday meal and telling everyone she is probably asleep because she ignored my text. unfortunately my girlfriend's social skills aren't excellent and as a result whenever she is annoyed at me she is totally incapable of expressing why she is annoyed, so she resorts to totally ignoring me.

yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend. in the morning i sent her a few messages saying ""what time should i pick you up"" and such, all of which went ignored. i decided to just pretend that she was asleep and i went without her. when i arrived i just made a joke saying ""i think she's still asleep"", she hasn't replied to any of my messages. at about 12:45 i got a string of messages asking where i was and what's going on. i just played dumb and said ""wait, you're ready? i thought you were still in bed or something??""

i knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but i didn't want to play this stupid game and i don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so i just decided to not pick her up.

"my mom took 15.000 out of my savings to pay for a new car, i need advice. so i will try and keep this short.

i have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced i chose to live with her, i have always trusted her and so on.

now we have never been rich, but we got by, i have always worked since i could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

now because of this i quickly started saving my money, pretty much, i would usually save up at least half of what i made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when i moved out and such.

so i turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so i wanted to see how much i had saved.

well you can see where this is going, i looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so i freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so i yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. she started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. i know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, i mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. my dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

well this was 2 weeks ago, i have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

in the meantime i have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

now here is what i said, untill i have every penny back i wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do i doubt i will ever forgive her. i need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",8
"by not wearing pants to a job interview. this happened today, 8:30am.

i cannot even try to make an excuse for how i could have literally forgotten a vital piece of clothing.

i got pretty close. i donned my favourite opaque tights and chose my shirt then i proceeded to get distracted by some forms i had to complete online, ran short on time, put on my long winter parka and left the house.

i got up to the interview feeling very comfortable and fifteen minutes early. as the receptionist told me to go hang up my coat i gladly walked over to do so. i began to unzip my jacket, looked down and for a brief moment i thought my skirt had just ridden up on my commute. nope, nothing there. luckily i never fully took off my jacket.

i proceeded to turn on my heel and leave. i got downstairs but was still holding the coat hanger.

i didn't want to be a theif on top of just leaving abruptly. so i then took the elevator back up, claimed a family issue, and returned the coat hanger.

silver living is they let me reschedule. so now i have an interview for later this afternoon. in about an hour.

tl;dr left my house without any pants on for a job interview then absconded with company property

edit: i think the job interview went well. i appreciate everyone's encouragement, and also thank you for the silvers.

i'm also happy (?) that so many other people have gone to work in various states of undress.

"by giving my son permission to beat his bully's ass.. my son was born with a condition called pectus excavatum. in layman's terms, his chest is sunken in. his condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. in december, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

about three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. the kid has been through a lot. 

well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. and because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, ""dad, i'm cleared now. a kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. can i kick his ass?"" well, my son isn't really a fighter. he's fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he's always gotten his ass kicked. so i just figured he was just talking. but this is the first i had heard about the bullying and i was concerned. i could tell he was distressed about the situation so i told him to knock the fucker out. he just nodded and went to his room. 

now, his older brother is s tough sob. he had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he's in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. i talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don't get in trouble. he told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. i asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. while i kinda agree with his thinking, i instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

the next morning i took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. on the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. ""have you taken xxxxx to school yet? well, after you do, go pick up your son. he got in a fight."" i just assumed it was my oldest son. imagine my surprise when i walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! he was beaming! he pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. ""i warned him."" i was so proud. 

he had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. my older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. he said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. he got suspended for three days. 

tl;dr i gave my son permission to beat up his bully because i didn't think he would and he did it.

edit one: the kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. it wasn't malicious. just two boys clowning around. he was horrified that he had hurt my son. the bully punched my son in the head every day. once he found out my son couldn't do anything about it, he just kept on. my son wasn't the only one he bullied, either. also, the bully's brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son could fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

edit two: my son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a lot of new friends. he used to hate going to school but now he's disappointed that school is out for summer. crazy!

"update: my 20 fiance's 27m behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship. i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as i felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. a lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

i spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who i am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. she expressed some concern and agreed that i should speak with fiance's brother. fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. that sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because i went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because i didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. i got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because i was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. i just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. i knew that something really needed to change.

the next day fiance left for work and i left for school just as usual. i called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and i basically told him that i had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that i was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if i wanted to speak with him. i was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. i hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. i was extremely nervous and felt like i was doing something sneaky and horrible, but i needed to know what was going on. i spoke with his manager and learned that he had quit his job weeks ago!! he told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. wtf! so i guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. after work i went home and fiance was gaming. i told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. he finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. i was literally shaking at this point and told him that i was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. i said that i was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. i said that i was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. at this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. so i did something stupid and stood in front of the tv and said that i knew about him quitting his job to game all day. he flipped out. he got violent and pushed me away from the tv. there was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). i got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. he eventually came and apologized. he offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. i literally felt sick. i locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. he literally just kept gaming until i went to sleep.

the next day i couldn't go to school because i had a bad black eye, it was not something i could explain away. i wanted to just disappear. i got on the bus and went to the women's center. my cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad i looked. i was very adament that i don't want to press charges or anything, i just needed help with the next steps of getting away. the social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. she helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while i drafted and sent fiance a text stating that i cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. he called me nearly 20 times during the time i was at the center. i didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. for the short term i am staying with my cousin and her husband and i'm working on finding an apartment. next month i'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. i still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like i'm living in a nightmare. but for the past week or so i haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. i've also gone to bed before 11 every night. someone on here sent me a pm saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so i'm just glad i was able to get away when i did. 

i don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and i just wanted to put this out here.",8

"for not helping my son and his wife with my grandson?. necessary information: when my oldest son was 16 he got his girlfriend pregnant. after a lot of trouble they made all kinds of promisses and decided they would care for the baby, this led to the girl getting kicked out by her parents and she came to live with us. except that when the baby was born, the girl broke up with my son and went back to her parent's house leaving the baby with us.

that was when my husband and i stepped up to help him raise our granddaughter while our son finished his studies and got a job to provide for her. when she was 1 year old he put her on daycare because my husband and i still worked and there was only so much we could do at that point. once he finished college he rented a place to live with her, the help we provided after that was when he needed to go somewhere and couldn't take her with him or when one of them got sick.

&#x200b;

now, the issue at hand is not with him, it's with his younger brother. he's 35 and married, he and his wife had my grandson last year, he's 10 months now. my daughter-in-law wants to go back to working and while she can do her work from home, she prefers to work outside. since i'm retired, my son asked me to take care of my grandson while they work. i asked him for how long he needed me to do it, to which my son replied that they didn't had a plan for it. i asked if they had considered daycare and he said that neither he or his wife were comfortable with it. i also suggested they asked his wife's parents and he said that they didn't had time for it.

&#x200b;

he thought of asking me because i had helped his brother all those years ago and it would ""basically be the same thing"". i told him that no, it was not. i was 42 then and i'm 59 now, i didn't had the health issues that i do nowadays like back pain and arthritis. also, he was a married man with a wife by his side, not a 16 year old with a baby.  i would be willing to help them for a short period of time but it seems like they have no plans beyond leaving the baby with me. now he thinks i'm playing favorites and that i'm pressuring him and his wife to comply with my demands but i think i'm just being reasonable.

"subreddits that ban users for being apart of another subreddit should be removed of reddit. lately i have been seeing posts where someone is banned for being apart of another subreddit. for example i saw someone who was subbed to the_donald was banned from offmychest and the reason the mod listed the ban for was he was apart of the_donald and they immediately thought he was a troll. i personally don't think people should be banned and stereotyped because of their political veiws from non political communities.

"a guy goes to las vegas to gamble and he loses all his money. he doesn't even have enough for a cab, but he flagged one down anyway. he explained to the driver that he would pay him back next time and gave him his phone number, but the driver told him, ""get the fuck out of my cab."". so he walked all the way to the airport and got home. some times rolls by and he decides to go back to vegas again and this time he wins big.
he gets his bags and is ready for the airport with all his new winnings. there are a line of cabs and at the very end he sees the driver from last time that kicked him out. he stood for a moment thinking how can he get his revenge on that driver.
so, he gets in the first cab.
""how much is it to the airport?"" he asks.
the driver says, ""$15""
""great, how much is it for a blowjob on the way there?""
the cab driver says, ""get the fuck out of my cab.""
so he goes to the next one and asks the same thing. ""how much to airport?""
""$15""
""great, how much for a blowjob on the way there?""
and that cab driver also tells him to get the fuck out of his cab.
he does this all the way down the line of drivers, each one kicking him out. he finally gets to the last driver, the one from his last trip.
he asks, ""hey how much to the airport?""
driver responds, ""$15""
the guy hands him $15 and says ""great let's go""
and so the driver leaves, slowly passing all the other drivers who are staring out their window while the guy in the back smiles back with a thumbs up.",0

"my brother died in a power line accident, did it hurt?. my brother died in a work accident. his drilling rig hit a 12,250-volt overhead power line.

anyway, would it hurt to die that way? 

he was working the controls, standing on the back of the truck when the arm of the drill hit the power line. witnesses saw the truck burst in flames, and the fire department wasn't able to make it to the truck for over an hour. 

i wanted to know if it was instant? would it hurt? did he burn alive? 

i told my mom that it was instantaneous and he didn't even know what happened, but reading online i don't know if that's true. 

i'm crying right now, it just sucks and i miss him terribly. 

edit: for those asking, this accident happened last may. the emotions are raw and fresh again because easter is coming up and we had all made plans to go to the mountains, last year during that time.

i had cancelled the plans last minute and a few days later the accident happened.

with it coming up again, i just keep thinking why did i cancel? we could have had one last day with him but we didn't. i want to go up this year, in his memory but i don't know if i can.

"my wife tried to hide my daughter from me. am i wrong to feel this angry?. my wife and i are married together and have three kids (11, 8, 3). 

when i was in my 20s i donated sperm as there is a massive shortage in my country (i literally donated after reading about this shortage in the newspaper). i've always been upfront about this fact with me wife. always. and she has always said she's okay with it.

fast forward to yesterday i answer the phone to a girl that immediately starts nervously apologising for calling me, but that she ""had to speak with me personally."" obviously i have no idea what the fuck is going on, so i ask her to explain what she's talking about.

turns out this girl is my daughter (i understand it's wrong to call her my daughter when i didn't raise her, but for lack of a better word...) and just turned 18. after turning 18 she got access to my contact details as required under my country's law regarding sperm donors. she called my house last week to talk to me and my wife picked up. apparently my wife told her that i wanted ""nothing to do with her"" and that she should ""never call this number again"" before hanging up. 

honestly broke my heart to hear that the woman i loved could be so fucking heartless. so for the last week this poor girl has been crying her eyes out trying to work up the courage to call again, and thankfully she did so when i was home.

i tried to keep my calm while on the phone and reassure her that i did not say any of that. we organised a place/time to meet, and as soon as my wife got home later that night i blew up at her. honestly, i've never yelled at anyone as long as i can remember, but i couldn't hold it in.

"i am 25 and getting married. dealing with issue around picking my ""maid of honor"" for my wedding. friends women in their 20s think my brother 35/m is a bad choice..   

i am planning my wedding to my awesome fiance and am so excited. we've been planning the event and will be married later in the year. he has his best man (his brother) and groomsmen mostly picked out. i thought i did, too. we each have 6 people and i have 5 female bridesmaids and a ""man of honor"" which i want to be my brother. my bridesmaids think this isn't a great idea and a few are hurt i'm not choosing them instead. here's why i want to choose my brother. 

my biological mother lost custody of me when i was 4 and i was put in an emergency foster situation with a family. i lived with them for 6 months but was then put back into my mother's case. from 4 1/2ish to 6 i lived with my mother and it was bad. she was too sick, too addicted and too weak to handle a child and by 6 i was being adopted out. by some miracle, the family who took me in at 4 got ahold in the system and i went to live with them and was later adopted. the family had boys – the youngest was 16 when i got there. i was terrified of him when i got there, which they told me about recently (i have no recollection of that). i do remember him spending the summer with me, teaching me to swim, teaching me how to play games, teaching me how different appliances worked. he skipped a summer job to help our mom with my adjustment. i had eating problems, i had dental problems, i had a snoot full of health problems – including parasites. he came to doctor appointments, he also helped get me ready for school (i hadn't started kindergarten yet and would actually never go). he and my mom would do learning activities with me and by september i was okay to enter first grade. i used to lay on my stomach and play geography games with him and he'd reward me with riesens. we were very close, he didn't go away to college as is tradition and instead stayed home to go to a good university locally. he'd pick me up from schools some days and from 6 to 12 i had an older brother to rely on. he eventually moved out and went to medical school (he's such a great person for that field). 

very literally my brother helped save my life. i was suicidal as a young kid, and through a lot of changes and help, was able to climb out. he was a calm stable influence in my life. i credit him, my mother and father with saving my life – i would never have gone to college, i probably wouldn't have graduated high school or even lived as i was so sick. i had 4 endoscopies, 4 colonoscopies and 3 surgeries before i was 8. my family doesn't look like me (i'm most likely mexican and something else, most probably african-american) and doesn't come from where i do, but they never treated me any differently than their other kids. since the others were older and out of the home i was never as close to them as i was my parents and brother. 

my thinking is, a maid of honor is someone really important and i cannot think of anyone else who comes close. i haven't even asked him yet but i think he'd do it. i told my parents and they said they wouldn't say anything to him but thought it was a great idea. my husband is also good with it and think it's a sweet thing to do, but my female friends were horrified i suggested it and think it's ""creepy"". if i look back on that time, it's the happiest a person could be. is it weird and creepy? does it contravene some weird relationship boundary between brothers and sisters? is it highly inappropriate?",8
"i'm a pedestrian who waved in an suv in a narrow gap and he got into an accident and he's threatening to sue me.. this happened a few days ago. i live in philly and i was walking along a busy street and i see this suv at a one-way narrow street waiting to move forward at a green light. there is a small car ahead of him that's turning right. the suv wasn't moving past the car because he thought he didn't have enough room. i saw that he did and i just gave him a thumbs up that he can go. he ended up hitting the other car (he was trying to avoid the curb i guess and turned at the last second). 

they got into a bit of an argument and shared info and decided to call the police to make a claim i think. i didn't really listen but the other guy (in the small car) asked me to hang back and provide a witness in case he needs it since i saw the whole thing. they both shared each others insurance and id.

the suv guy asked me for my id for witness too for his insurance claim. soon after he took a picture of my id on his phone he said i was the reason he moved and that he will have to make a claim against me. he is threatening to sue me and said that he would rather just send me the damage bill of both of the cars. i felt bad because i gave him the thumbs up that there was room but he did turn at the last second. the other guy was also annoyed that i shouldn't have told him to go. 

he called and left a vm that i need to act soon because if he makes a claim in a court it would lead to a lot of legal fees for both of us or something. he said that if i agree to pay i can just pay half of the damages.

i'm worried that it's going to be a huge amount and i don't want to go to court. if it goes to court will i have my credit ruined? sorry i don't know too much legal stuff!

i want to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice and words of encouragement. i read every single comment on both threads about my situation and i really really appreciate the support and help. if not for the advice here, i probably would not have felt justified in leaving.

i'm sorry for taking so long to post, but i am now back home in nh with my parents. i feel like i'm coming out of a fog and i feel really stupid for believing everything; i guess i just justified it by assuming laws were different in the south. 

i left with just my computer, my phone, my documents, and a few family heirlooms. i'm not concerned about my phone being tracked as i am still on my dad's phone plan. my husband has sent me about 200 texts and has filled my voicemail completely but i haven't spoken to him.

i managed to withdraw half the balance of two out of three joint accounts. the third is a local bank and i did not want to stay in the area any longer. my parents told me to just leave the money. they are going to help me get the medical procedures i need and then they are going to help me pay for a divorce attorney. i thought they would say i told you so because they told me not to get married, but they have been very supportive and even offered to pay for me to go back to college and finish my degree.

i did another smart move by having our meeting spot be at this indian casino. she said she had never gambled in her life so i brought her in and we had a drink and i gave her 20$ to spend. she found this bee slot machine (my last name has honey in it, so the bee was appropriate) and ended up winning $150! at that point it was getting pretty late so i walked her to her car gave her a kiss and said goodnight. i am going to see her this weekend again. definitely stoked!",8
"my m20 girlfriend f19 of 7 years died in a car accident in front of me. i am completely broken. i need some support. update: my brother decided to end his life... hi, i would like the mods of reddit to delete this post after 2 weeks or so. i just feel the need inform all of you since you showed much interest. 

if you don't remember/haven't read the original post, here it is: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9bmn5k/my_m20_girlfriend_f19_of_7_years_died_in_a_car/

as you see from title, my brother decided to end his life two days ago. i am his older brother, i am 23 years old while he was 20. that day, when he posted on reddit, he came to my house (i live in another city), and he decided to stay. we had a long talk, and i was trying to make him feel better, even though that was a hard thing to do. he also showed to me his post on reddit and told me how helpful you guys were, symphathetic and what not.

unfortunately the loss of his girlfriend completely destroyed him. he lost over 10 kgs in just approximately 1 month, he was simply refusing to eat, only a few meals here and there, and even though after some point he decided to seek for professional help, as you also guys suggested him, that didn't help him at all. i was trying my best. until the day he decided to do that he was living in my house, he took a huge break from university so he could focus on healing himself. 

two days ago i was at work, and he was at home, as always. when i came back i saw something that i hope none of you ever experience in your lives.. he hanged himself. it hurts me saying that. it was rather unexpected. even though lately he was showing some warning signs to me, i never thought he would actually do that. about a week ago he decided to stop going to the psychologist that was taking care of him, and when i asked him for the reason, he said ""it's just not needed anymore"".

right next to his dead body there was a letter, and he actually said a bunch of things.he thanked my parents, me, and everyone who was supporting him till the last moment. even you guys. he said he was sorry and his last words were ""tell mum and dad i love them. i can't keep up with this anymore. i am sorry. i love you"".

i tried my best all those weeks to cheer him up, to go out with him and make him feel better, but he would always refuse. i don't blame him. losing someone you truly love and are in a relationship with for 7 years is not an easy thing. even more when you see that person getting killed right in front of you. i am in a complete shock, life was unfair to my brother, and he unfortunately couldn't make it. we were always so close to each other, and he was an amazing brother, an amazing person. it really sucks to say the least. i soemtimes feel it's my fault. 

i felt the need to inform all of you since he posted here a couple of weeks ago and got a huge feedback. i want to say a big thanks on behalf of my brother and from me aswell. you guys are amazing.

thanks once again.

p.s: a few comments here are saying how this is fake, a made up story. if you think that's the case then it's ok. i am not here to argue or try to persuade any of you, but to rather inform you because a couple here showed much interest and genuinely tried to help my bro. sucks to say but things like this do happen, and experiencing such is awful. 

as for the rest of you, thank you people for the nice words.",8

so i was away for the holidays and i came back on monday to find my project car was towed out of my driveway, my pond was emptied out and filled with gravel and sand and a fenced off 2 acres (2 chains by one furlong) of my property closest to hoa. i immediately called the police and filed a report regarding the stolen property. the car wasn't registered and was just an empty shell so i have no idea where it is nor will it be easy to track. it's not worth a lot (maybe $2,500?) but it's the principle of that jackass president of the hoa.


i had my lawyer draft up the c&d and sent it nearly 2 weeks ago and they haven't contacted me in any way except this. i hired a local salvage company to come tear up the fence this weekend and they are doing it free of charge since i'm letting them keep the fence to sell as scrap metal or whatever they do with it. 

my lawyer suggested i send up a letter demanding payment to fix my pond as it was filled in with gravel and sand. a local landscape company quoted me nearly $8,000 to get the pond back to the way it was so that is what he suggested i ask and another $2,000 for loss of use of the pond. the hoa has lawyered up so i think it's best i no longer post anything else on here until it's settled. i didn't want to leave you all without some closure since you all have been an amazing help. i've put a picture of the layout since a few people asked. it's bad but should convey the land.

as soon as i touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck i was doing. i explained. she then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. i told her i knew for a fact she was alone because i just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. so i started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

this released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. i saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so i figured i'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""oh i'm sorry, i didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. my bad, i'll get up now"". i got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as i was walking away.

i noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so i kinda wondered if i stepped too much out of line there.",3

"for asking my wife to have an abortion. my wife and i (both mid 30s) have been happily married for nine years. we don't have any kids and don't want kids. we had the ""what if"" talk before getting married; she told me she would want to have an abortion if she ever got pregnant.

yesterday my wife told me she's nine weeks pregnant. she's on the pill, but accidents happen. she said she wants to carry to term and give the baby up for adoption. naturally, i was surprised by the news and her change of mind. i asked her if she considered getting an abortion. she said she had, but she doesn't want to because she feels a bond to the fetus. she told me she has been researching adoption and learned that the local adoption agencies only accept birth mothers who are okay with having an open adoption. i told her i wasn't really comfortable with this and asked her if she would have an abortion. she started crying and spent the night at her sister's place. she wont answer my phone calls.

i'm uncomfortable with this for a few reasons. i was adopted a birth and my adoptive parents weren't the best. i know this isn't the case for everyone who was adopted, but i can't help but have a negative view about it. a few years ago i tried to find my biological parents to learn my medical history, but i couldn't. i was sore about it for a little while, but it doesn't bother me anymore. my wife is aware of these points.

i just don't want to pass on my genes because they're essentially a mystery to me. i also don't like kids. my wife said she actually would prefer to keep the baby, but she knows i wouldn't want to; so she said having an open adoption sounded like a reasonable compromise. i understand why she thinks that, but i still don't want to have any biological children, regardless of how much/little i would be involved in raising him or her.

for asking my wife to have an abortion?

edit: my wife takes birth control for reasons other than contraception. if she ever wanted to stop taking it, i would support her 100%. i realize that i'm an idiot for not getting a vasectomy a long time ago though. it honestly never occurred to me until now (i think because my wife has always been on birth control and said she would have an abortion). i see now that it was irresponsible of me to not get one regardless. i'm going to get snipped asap.

edit #2: she and i talked; it was emotional for both of us, but no voices were raised. here are the main takeaways:

* i apologized for putting her in this position by being an idiot and not getting a vasectomy earlier. i also apologized if she felt like i was pressuring her when i asked her to have an abortion. i didn't mean to pressure her, but i know words aren't always received as we intended. she said she felt pressured a little, but forgave me because she knows i was totally caught off guard.
* she apologized for having a change of heart regarding abortion. she said she was really surprised by her own feelings and hopes i don't feel like she tricked me (i don't).
* we mutually agreed that it would be good to spend one more night apart to really think. we've always have a strong marriage, and we're both committed to working through this - whatever that may look like.",3

"muslim guy 22m whom i 22f multiply rejected over the years writes to my friends to find out about my virginity. we have been attending the same university over the last 6 years and share a lot of common friends.

during the first year of uni, he has asked me out and i declined. during the years, i have tried my best to stay away (as much as possible), however, he interpreted every accident glance as my approval of his advances. i guess, in total, i had to decline him about 10 times or so.

however, during last summer i had made a mistake by replying him on one of his messages (just asking how i am). we have talked a little, and that's all. soon after i had stumbled upon him near my house. i confronted him again, he denied following me. after that i told him to stay away and blocked him in all social media.

it all has been silent until last month. two weeks ago my best friend told me he wrote her, directly asking  her if i have ever been in a physical relationship with a man. she didn't answer him except asking why on earth does he want to know such personal information. he did not reply.

today he wrote to her again, demanding a link to my (hypothetical) boyfriend' profile.

i lost my wits, wrote to him again, telling him to leave me and my friends in peace. he denied writing to my best friend, which is absolutely foolish. i have ranted and once again blocked him.

however, i do not believe this is the end. i am angry at such intrusion in my personal life and a little scared for my safety. i mentioned his religion because he came to our city from southern regions with very ""tradiotional"" views upon marriage and female consent.

he never seemed dangerous or violent in university, just a little slow to understand.

"my (18f) best friend (18f) cheated on her boyfriend (21m), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. should i tell him?. ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. also i know this is pretty fucked up but natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

we graduated high school this summer so our friends and i all went on a small vacation to italy. we found a groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. natalie is dating eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. it was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. it's pretty well known among us friends that dylan who is in our high school, likes natalie. he's like really into her. well when we all went to europe, since eric wasn't there, natalie was all over dylan. acting like a couple, being all flirty. they'd sleep in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. well, i shared a room with natalie and i walked in on them having sex. afterwards i asked her what she was doing since she was dating eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. it was not. we were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. dylan's dreams came true that week. but only i knew about it since it was our room. everyone else had their suspicions but i was the only one who really knew the truth. 

when we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on eric again. she kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. so i promised to keep her little fling a secret. fucked up i know but i have more loyalty to natalie than eric. 

she continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and i asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if i slapped her across the face. she said it's obviously eric and i reminded her about dylan and she insisted that eric is the father and to never mention dylan in front of her again. she's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. she told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. he wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

y'all. dylan is obviously the father. like 100%. they were fucking like rabbits in italy and i don't think she knew how to say ""where can i buy condoms"" in italian. i feel bad for eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

i love natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like i feel really bad for eric. i know she's scared and eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. but it's not fair for him. i know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

i don't know like if i tell eric, natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",8
"for being upset my mil won't make a ""family quilt"" for me and my husband because we have no kids?. my mil has made a small ""family quilt"" for all of her kids and their spouses (5 couples including us). the quilt is really cute, has the couple's names, their kids' names, and their favorite hobbies and things all done in stitching and cute little cloth pictures. i was really looking forward to getting ours because i admit i'm a bit of a hipster and i love home-made kitschy stuff like that for our home.

she recently finished her latest one for my husband's brother and i thought we were getting ours soon since my husband is the youngest. i asked my sil (she got hers first) and she very awkwardly informed me that no such quilt will be coming our way. i was a bit upset and asked my husband to investigate. turns out mil has no intention of making a quilt for us because there's not enough to put on all the squares or whatever, basically meaning since we don't have kids we don't deserve a quilt because she can't be bothered.

i message her directly about it because i'm just that kind of person. i like hearing it straight from the other guy. mil says her fingers hurt after the first 4 quilts and she's taking a break. i ask her if it has anything to do with the fact that we have no kids (which she expressed negativity against in the past) and she says no even though i know it's a lie. i push her more and ask her when she thinks the quilt will be done after her little ""break"" and she kind of loses her temper and says there's no quilt and there never will be a quilt.

i ask why and she says she's only interest in making quilts with her grandkids and things on them and we don't have enough hobbies and kids' hobbies to fill up a whole quilt. i tell her we have 2 beautiful dogs whom we love and could be put on there and she says ""i'm not making a whole quilt for a couple of goddamn dogs"" verbatim. i hang up and tell my husband and he's 100% on my side.

but now i got a really mean voice message from my sil telling me that i crossed the line and am acting like a huge b\*tch for no reason. i'm shocked because i have a great relationship with my sil and she always defended me from other family bullshit. my husband wants no part in this now. for what i said to my mil?",3

"my mother (50f) asks me (20f) to travel home to wake up my teenage brother (15m). hi everyone,

this morning i was yelled at down the phone by my mother for refusing to travel 1 hour home and back to wake my 15 year old brother up for school. she has always babied and coddled him, to the point where he is 16 this year and she still puts his socks on for him, brings all his meals and snacks to him and makes zero attempt to help him mature. he is never left home alone, she tells him what to do and when, and both of my parents lives revolve around him. he does not know how to boil a kettle, and has never done anything independently. if he doesn't want to do something, he will have a tantrum. i would like to point out that he has no learning difficulties or anything like that that would explain this. he has just not grown up. my birthday day out to london was cancelled because he didn't want to go, and i was called selfish as a result. i am 20, i've been living away from home at university one city away for about 2 years now.

previously, she has asked me to come home from university to walk my brother 15 minutes home from school, at 4pm, along a route he has done 1000x before. yesterday, she called me to ask if i would come home from uni on wednesday to put my brother's dinner on as she is going to a funeral. a sad event, but of a relative she rarely sees who is very old and died naturally. i am not saying she shouldn't go to the funeral, just that it was not out of the blue. she had been preparing for this for a while. i said i wasn't happy about it, but i didn't have plans that day, so fine.

this morning she calls me to say the funeral was at 9:30am so she'd be back by tea-time. i thought great, no reason for me to come home as my brother is at school. but actually she now wants me to come back tuesday evening (late) after volunteering and a busy day. tuesday evening is the only time i get to see my boyfriend this week, so i said no. the reason she wants me to come back is so i can wake my brother up for school wednesday morning and make sure he locks the front door. i told her that was too much of an ask for something he can do himself, and she proceeded to call me a selfish child, and that 'we all have to do things we don't want to do' and that she has made sacrifices for me. at this point i just said i wasn't having this conversation and hung up. i then text her to explain that i don't want to come back for multiple reasons- my boyfriend, i have a busy day on tuesday, and it's just not practical. plus the reason she wants me to come back is ridiculous, as he is almost 16 and can easily set an alarm. i shouldn't have to travel 2 hours round-trip to wake my 16 brother up for school.

so, am i being unreasonable? i understand she is going to a funeral, but surely this is unacceptable. i am a 20 year old woman with a life of her own in a completely different city. if my brother had to be left alone for days of course i would come back, or if something sudden happened. but he is almost 16, and will literally be at school for most of the day they want me back. he should be able to wake himself up for one day, get himself breakfast and walk out the door- he gets picked up by someone else's mum before school.

any advice at all would help.

tldr: my mum is going to a funeral on wednesday and wants me to travel a 2 hour round trip to wake my 15 yo brother up for school. she has a history of babying him and i'm a university student with my own life in a different city. am i wrong to say no and that he should just set an alarm seeing as i have other plans? edit: typo. 

update: i called my dad to explain the situation and he said he agreed with my mother and that i was a disappointment to the family. he said it was not about what they asked me to do but that they rarely ask for help and when they do i should always help where i can- it was the principle that counts. he also said i was opening a can of worms and that there's a lot i should be doing at 20 that i'm not. when i asked what i should be doing he said driving, which is ridiculous as i live in a big city and the only reason i'm not learning is because it's too expensive and would be useless when i can easily bus/train everywhere. he knows this. he then repeated he was disappointed in me and i hung up the phone, upset, after saying i don't know want more they want me to do. i had a job i've saved my wages from so i can budget accordingly, i do well at university, i am good with money, i have responsible friends and a great boyfriend, i make time to see my parents when i can. currently feeling very hopeless and deflated. thank you for your support though, everyone",8
"my parents chose their new families over me so i moved in with my aunt. now they want back in. but i hate them. hi.

so i 16. moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

my father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. my mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

after all that i became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that i didn't exist and play happy family.

after a year i became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home i would never interact with anyone. both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. i wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon i was labeled as the black sheep of the family. every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. i was just so fed up that i packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. i took a bus and went mia for 4 days. ofcourse the police was called and when i appeared again i hit another lecture.

we got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and i told them i hated them. i called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

in the car i could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. we informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

my parents ways half assed our contact. appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. recently they tried to build more contact up but i was not interested.

i won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did i invite them to the celebration. and on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. i didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. basically i have cut them out of my life.

i am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. she got upset and called me crying and..... i just didn't care. it was like listening to a tv character cry. it wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again i didn't care.

as far as i am concerned my aunt is my only parent. she encourages that i build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. they tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and i just said no and left. i still resent them for choosing a new life over me. but i don't know if i am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. i don't want them in my life but would i be making the right choice? ""idk

edit : because people think o just made it up and i am a moody teen

you know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? that was the feeling i constantly had at their houses.

i know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. my parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. but not in the sense ""i want to have her longer"" but ""i took her last weekend! it's your turn"".

also planing fun activities for the day after i leave. my father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. they had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

they shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

when there are family functions i am often excludes. e.g my dad had a family bbq and didn't invite me 

they forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar starbucks gift card even when they know i don't like starbucks. 

so no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",8
"for correcting every single sentence spoken by my boyfriend's aunt in front of everyone?. i know the title looks pretty bad but hear me out! 
i'm a native french speaker from canada, but i have a very pronounced ""acadian/chiac"" accent. for those who don't know, it's pretty much a mix of french and english with some local dialect thrown in there. pretty common in the maritimes, where i still live. i'm perfectly bilingual in both languages.

i started dating my boyfriend, who only speaks english, about 4 years ago and spend a lot of time with his family, they've all been really great, except for one of his aunts. she says she was a french teacher in anglophone schools for over 40 years up until a year ago and even studied in france, and she insists on only talking to me in french. i agreed at first since i didn't want to be rude to his family but it's getting super weird. i don't understand how she was able to teach kids english or how she comes up with most of her sentence, like i have to guess 90% of whatever she says and hope i'm right because it makes absolutely no sense. (example: she said ""a la citrouille la tarte va bien dans ma bouche"" which roughly translates to ""to the pumpkin a pie goes well in my mouth"" when she meant ""this pumpkin pie tastes delicious"") 
she constantly criticizes my ""accent"".  and tries to correct my pronunciation of certain words, and tells me i need to ""pick a language"" when i accidentally say something in chiac (speaking proper ""français standard"" is actually getting harder for me since i've been only studying/working in english). 

so last night during dinner she started going on about how acadians were uneducated and made no effort to properly learn a language, which is total bs, and obviously weirdly directed at me. for the rest of the night i stopped guessing what she was trying to say to me in french, acting like i didn't understand anything, and started correcting her as well - which was pretty much every single sentence she said. i wasn't trying to be rude or aggressive about it but after a while she gave up on the french and ignored me for the rest of the night.  
turns out she was super pissed and told everyone i was trying to embarrass her in front of everyone. looking back i think i might've taken it too far by not stopping after 2-3 sentences and i feel bad. my boyfriend said i was being bitchy while his mom said she probably deserved it. here?


edit: forgot to mention that i told her a few years ago that it's hard for me to fully speak proper french as i spoke chiac all my life, tried to explain acadian culture (she wasn't having it, surprise) and she stopped for a while but is now doing it again.",3

without pause nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

the next day, horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the queen's bra while she bathed. soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

upon being summoned to the royal chambers to address this incident, horatio informed the king and queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

the king, eager to help his queen, quickly summoned nick to their chambers. 

horatio then slipped nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, nick worked passionately on the queen's large and magnificent breasts. the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

upon returning to his chamber, nick found horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. with his obsession now satisfied, nick couldn't have cared less knowing that horatio could never report this matter to the king and with a laugh told him to get lost.

the next day, horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the king's underwear. the king immediately summoned nick.

my aunt is not someone i see often. she got on with my son but only really saw him a handful of times a year. she came a few times to see him when he was sick but not often. when we were told he didn't have long left i asked if she wanted to come and say goodbye and she said she was too busy with work. i figured she was in denial, maybe. i certainly was. she then missed his funeral to go to a concert.

her husband messaged me yesterday asking if he would be able to get some of our sons ashes so she can have some jewellery made. apparently she asked him for one for her birthday as she really misses our son and wants to feel close to him. i said no because i want him to stay with us. all of him. then my aunt called me yesterday afternoon and said i was being selfish, he was her family too.

"matched with girl on tinder. profile said 18, got phone number, she calls and reveals she's 10.. i blocked her and the texts were super short and completely non sexual. she randomly calls me and i was like shit she sounds super young. i text her and ask if she's 18. she said yes. later she texts me and said she was lying. she facetimes me and she's in fucking kid pajamas and says she's 10 and calls me stupid. 

this is dangerous. what can i do to notify her parents ?  it is an att number. should i call them? 



edit : i looked up the number on social media. nothing. i reported it to tinder using their online form. 

she used fake pictures of course. i could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. i will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. i reported it to tinder and that's all i will do. some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. the second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) i hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. she revealed she was 10 while i was in the process of blocking the number. 

even before she said she was under 18 i said absolutely zero things that wouldn't be okay to say to a ten year old, so i know i'm in the clear. i believe there's zero case to be made for any sort of enticing or anything like that. ",7
"nsfw by posting a video of me masturbating to my work group chat. 

okay so this literally just happened. im dying slowly from the embarrassment, and cant believe it happened to me. 

on snapchat we have a work group chat that i post on pretty frequently. well tonight my so asked me to send her a video of me masturbating cause she gets off on that and we haven't been able to see each other in a couple days do to our schedules. i always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn't have a home button. so apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. 

i realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. it wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow 


tl;dr dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat


update: so im not getting fired luckily. im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. ive heard so many michael jackson just beat it references its unreal. the group chat is mostly comprised of people i go to college with. even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. my boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn't post my dick in the groupchat.  also holy fuck this blew up! thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.

edit 2: people think im lying so group chat image for proof added https://imgur.com/cukvx5w.jpg


edit 3: just got off work, and apparently people still dont believe thus happened  so heres me and my so conversation after it happened.  with the time on  the ss cause i sent it to the group chat so they knew what was going on

it was a beautiful ceremony, however i did find some things strange. for instance, the priest never said, ""you may now kiss the bride"", but i just assumed it was purely an american thing and didn't mind.

later during the reception, we were both starving and decided to head over to the buffet to get food. on the way we passed the drink table, where about six people were waiting to get a fruity drink from a bowl.

as we passed, they all said in unison, ""you may now kiss the bride!"" my wife got giddy and gave me a big kiss, which i of course returned.

as we walked away i asked, ""why did *they* tell us to kiss and not the priest?""

just a little back story... we have been together for about a year and live together. let's talk dirty:

the kitchen - she loves to cook, but does not clean as she goes. dishes will pile up. trash gets full. unless i clean the kitchen which is basically every day bc i can't stand the mess it will stay dirty. i have talked to her before about how i shouldn't have to clean every single day, but she just doesn't get it. 

laundry - she will pile that shit up and let it pile forever. she be questioning whether garments are clean or dirty. half the time i do her laundry and i have to ask her to fold it. if i don't, she will just add the clean clothes to another basket. 

room- when she gets home from work she just takes her clothes off throughout the room when she could have just put it in the dirty laundry to begin with. she will bring food into the room and leave dirty plates and cups for days. things start to cultivate! 

honestly, i have talked to her about cleanliness and how important it is, but she doesn't get it. i explained that we are now living together and we need to come to some sort of middle grounds. whenever i bring it up she gets annoyed. she will clean the day after i mention it and then never do it again until i bring it up again. ugh. advice, suggestions?


edit: wow this really blew up! i just wanted a little advice so that i could hear different perspectives. some of you provided great advice so i appreciate that! will definitely be talking to her to see what can work best for both of us.",8

-i tried to facetime her 11:51 pm just to say goodnight, she didn't pick up. i tried messaging her but no response. 

remember that spare phone that's with me where her google account is logged in? i browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there's a ""google assistant"" command recorded at 11:48 pm.

i played and listened. there's her voice and a voice of another guy. they were goofing around at the google home device. so yeah. 

i confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 am.  she kept on denying she's cheating.

"for refusing to share my extra income with my wife when she didn't share hers with me when she earned more?. when my wife \32f\ and i \32m\ got married eighht years ago, she made about 15k more per year than i did. our agreement at that time was that we'd keep separate checking accounts plus a joint for household expenses, with the understanding that money left over after contributions to household expenses, savings, retirement, etc. would be put in the separate accounts and we could spend it how we wanted. my wife was the one who insisted on this, and although i was not a fan (wanted joint accounts for all funds), i agreed since she felt strongly about it.

"by labeling the breast milk in the fridge ""freshly squeezed titty juice"". the repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.

my wife and i have a newborn and we've been calling her breast milk 'titty juice' from the moment it came out.  we found it funny and as we're finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.

while i was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  that rest was very short lived.  the baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...

when she read ""freshly squeezed titty juice 21/07/2019"" she lost her got damn mind.  she woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  raised with no manners or respect.  she then left the house saying she doesn't know if she can come back.

my wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  she passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.

i didn't get upset because i'm not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.

tl;dr  i labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  now i have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks i embody everything that's wrong with western culture and parents these days.",4

"for telling my parents i won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?. i'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. i have a car that i bought with money i'd saved from work, and i pay my own gas. however my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

they said i need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. and the problem is that i get motion sick easily; even when i'm driving. too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when i'm in a car make me feel ill too.

i'm not exaggerating, i've always been like this. as a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. i always make sure i know where my barf bag is on a plane. i always used to take motion sickness pills, but i'm not allowed when i'm driving because they make you tired.

anyway, i can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me i literally feel so sick because of his bo. even with the windows on my side open

my friend told me i should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

so i did that and told my mom and dad that i couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. either they could check or i would. and they blew up at me saying that i was being nasty and humiliating, that if i wouldn't drive my brother i couldn't drive. and i said fine; i'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

and that caused a big fight, because i guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

"i (23f) genuinely think that there's someone living in my attic.. i'm not sure this is the right place to post but it made the most sense to me. i have reasonable suspicion that someone is squatting in my attic or accessing it on a regular basis. 

to note. the house hadn't been lived in for about 4 months prior. and is in an okay area of cleveland, oh. 

i've been moved in for about a month and a half - i've heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then i've just chucked it up to being new house sounds. i'll be honest and say i've been too scared to see if anything's up there since i've moved in so i've never even seen the attic. today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so i asked him to check it out. he popped up with a flashlight and there's a tent set up. he came down and told me. my sister and i came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. the back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. we called the cops and waited about ten minutes. once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. cops didn't do anything and didn't even go up to check. they were neato. so i put my head up to check while they were there. it's a tent. there's playing cards. they took my name and left. 

sooo i nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. i was thinking first thing i should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

other than that - do i hire someone to check the house? do i call the cops again another day?  
should i not stay here alone?

edit 2: please stop giving me awards this is a throwaway account. spend your money on people who make dank memes

the title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

my fiance and i are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, summer 2021.

i make pretty good money for my age. in fact, i make more money than any of my friends or family, and i would bet i'm in the ""1%"" of my community. i try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. i should also add when we started dating, i was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

my fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. she was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  since then, she hasn't worked. i really didn't mind at all. i make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

i am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead i just would venmo her some cash weekly. it was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

she has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. i know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  she has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

i shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

i told her i would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so i could see exactly what she was spending it on. i could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but i hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

she blew up. telling me i wasn't trusting her and how i was the one against joint bank accounts so i should understand her privacy. yeah, huge red flags all over the place.

i talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying i was not respecting her privacy when i'm the one that demands it also.

"often, being liked doesn't require you to be interesting/funny. it just requires you to make other people feel interesting/funny.. i'm not saying people never gain pleasure from others being interesting or funny. but the fact is in most interactions, everybody is heavily self-monitoring and will base their judgement of the success of the interaction on how people responded to *them*. if people laughed at their joke. if people found their anecdote interesting or shocking. if people agreed with their opinion. 

so the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they're boring is: you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself. honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you're talking to. listen. ask questions/follow-up questions. laugh at their jokes. and they'll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to.

so as the title states, last year i was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when i was 14/15. i thought i would update now that it's come to a resolution.

i went to see a lawyer the day after i made that post. he drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that i had nothing to worry about. it was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. then i got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

i panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. he was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. he was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). i wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that i wasn't really allowed to know about.

anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus i'm getting married in a few months and i'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. so i thought i'd update here with the good news! i was afraid that i'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys i got up the courage to deal with the situation. i really appreciate the advice i got here! thank you again so much.

"my 22f boyfriend of 3 years 23m and i just had a huge fight over a tampon.. yes. you read that correctly. the subject matter is... a tampon. to preface, i took a plan b recently and with that comes your period. so today i woke up at about 7 am as i began my menstrual cycle. going to skip the tmi, and simply say i had to run immediately to our bathroom (located in our room). unfortunately there were no tampons in our bathroom they were downstairs. i asked my bf to please go get me one from downstairs and he refused. just a straight up ""no i'm sleeping and tired leave me alone"" i tried to explain to him that it was an emergency and i really needed his help in that moment as i was essentially stuck on the toilet and he just replied with ""no use a towel or something and you go get it"". i started crying bc i'm a fairly emotional person and it really made me sad that he wouldn't help me when i really needed it. he is the reason i currently got my period anyways (plan b). well i guess my crying upset him even more so he got up and said i ""do too much"" and tried to slam the bathroom door so he could ignore me. in the process he clipped my legs and as a result turned my whole body which turned the toilet seat, essentially breaking it off. i know all of this sounds bad, typing it out really shows me how disturbing his reaction was. i guess i'm just trying to be level headed and see if there are any opposing perspectives. was i being too dramatic or am i justified in wanting to break up over this? his reaction in general tells me that he does not know how to conduct himself maturely and respectfully. but to play the devil's advocate, he is a d1 college athlete so he is on a very tight schedule with long days resulting in him being tired most of the time. sorry if this is rambling just looking for opinions before i move out and back home across the country. bc if i decide that there is no coming back (my parents wouldn't let me lol).

edit: he is home from practice. not sorry. not remorseful. still blaming me for doing too much. i can't stop crying. i showed him all of your responses and he said you're all wrong and i'm stupid for taking advice from reddit. i'm heartbroken.

edit 2: i fuckin love reddit man. i'm sitting here crying but every response i read makes me feel a little stronger. i'm the biggest cry baby ever and i really thought i loved this guy. so naturally i'm super sad. but i need this. i needed to be shown that this isn't normal or ok. thank you guys.

"meta: too many commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.. i've become frustrated with how quick a lot of commenters are to encourage op's to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. while leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

when we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for love, empathy, understanding, and communication. these capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our ""throw-away"" consumer society. i often get a feeling that many commenters don't have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",3

"for telling my grandma she looks like ronald mcdonald because she wouldn't stop telling me i look like a bull with my nose ring in?. edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought i'd make an edit. my piercing is not a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. septum piercings are usually tagged as ""looking like a bull"" (i don't agree with that) but i have my hoop in my nostril.

here's how it happened. every time i see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of ""take that thing out of your nose, you're ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull."" the last time she said it to me i politely asked her to leave it alone or next time i wouldn't be so polite. to be fair this is the first time i spoke up because i'm not confrontational but the older i get the more i stand up for myself. and for that matter, i shouldn't even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. i immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like ronald mcdonald. a lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but a) i warned her and asked her to stop and b) she's insulting my appearance so why is what i said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? i'm usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn't even make sense) does not ""ruin"" my face and even if it does it's really not her place. i'm a grown ass woman and i refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman.

"by having sex with a tampon in, losing it, and having to get my professor remove it (nsfw). this happened last night. put a tampon in around 6pm and went about my evening activities. i had a busy night, but at the end of the night i got to see my boyfriend. totally forgot about the tampon and we had sex. i have a pretty light flow/low key periods due to an iud, so between that and my busy day i totally forgot i had a tampon in. 

we wake up this morning and i remember. my stomach drops. i immediately go to the bathroom and i can't feel it. its gone. i tried switching positions, squatting, had my boyfriend try, everything i could think of. nothing. after close to a half hour of trying, hoping, and praying to the vagina gods, i accept my fate. this shit is gone. 

at this point i'm worried that i'm never finding this thing and it's going to be stuck inside of me forever. i also know the risk of contracting tss if i keep it in much longer so i know i need to get it taken care of sooner rather than later. after class i'm off to our student health center. i go to a small college, so the doctor is only in for an hour a day. i strategically timed it so that i wouldn't see the doctor-- he teaches one of my classes, gen med, at night once a week. i wasn't keen on having my professor dig through my vagina to find a lost tampon, so i was hoping the nurse could do it. 

nurse is very nice and reassuring but says i have to wait for the doctor. great. some time later i'm in a gown, in the stirrups, waiting for my professor to come in, just full of dread. he comes in and is super friendly because he knows me from class, which is the last thing i wanted. really wish he would have just stayed silent at this point and pretended that he didn't know me. 

he starts the vaginal exam and the following exchange occurs:
dr, to the nurse: ""well, she got some pretty good news last night""
me: "".........""
dr: ""theres no final in gen med!""
me: ""..oh""

i for real thought he was commenting that the sex was good. don't get me wrong, it was, but that was even more mortifying than being in the stirrups, naked from the waist down, having my professor look at my vagina. 

he finds the tampon after 5 long, agonizing minutes of searching. i have his class in a few days. not sure how i'm going to look at him. i'm a 4.0 student and i've never felt more stupid in my entire life. 

tl;dr: forgot i had a tampon in and had sex, losing the tampon. had to go to the health center to get it removed by my professor, who is also the campus physician. 

edit: i was dumb enough to say ""stupider"" instead of more stupid, as many of you have pointed out. its been a long day, ya'll. 
 
edit 2: turns out ""stupider"" was fine. lesson learned: those terms are interchangeable, trust your gut. also, take your tampon out before sex. 

edit 3: wow, i didnt really expect this post to blow up like it did. thanks for making a story about my vagina make the front page, guys. 
for those of you asking, it ended up near my cervix. it was too small/deep for me to have much success getting it myself, because when you lean forward to do a self-exam, the vaginal canal tightens.

"new york - i've been visited by cps 8 times, to enquire about a child i don't have. at what point it becomes harassment or stalking?. there's a cps agent that seems to be convinced that i have a child and i'm locking the child in my home. first time i was visited, i was very understanding. i allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. everything seemed fine. obviously no child and no evidence of one, because i don't have a child.

this was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until i stopped cooperating. i told her that from now on the only way i'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. a few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. the officer told me that it will be a lot easier if i allowed them to look at my house, i allowed the officer to do that by himself. again, no child was found. his search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times i have refused to talk to her. once, as i left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. it definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. i called the police but it went nowhere. i have called the cps office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. this last incident happened this last thursday.

this woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. everyone has told her that i don't have a child. 

this definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. if this was a legitimate cps operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, i'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance i guess? but they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. so maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

this is really going too far and is affecting my life. i actually fear for my safety now. i will install security cameras this week and will call the police if i found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the cps.

do i have a legal recourse here? like filing a restraining order against the cps (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? this definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. not sure how stalking is defined legally. what's the best way to stop her?

"american colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.. according to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. in america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


in those 8 years of school, i must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. there are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and i hate using this term) a sheep. to my understanding, american colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (not 100% sure on that) so, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of stem field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90°, not 45°, not even 1°.


edit: ok, i understand and agree that philosophy is important. however, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. i just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. hell, my school has bio ethics, i haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

it honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",6

"by being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. nsfw. well, this didn't happen today. but it's a funny story that i couldn't share with reddit at the time.

rewind back to me at 14 years old. awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

as such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

one night, to avoid watching tv with my dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, i claimed that i had ""homework"" to do. of course, this was a lie. i just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

so i fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

now this is where things went wrong. i got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

you see, my bedroom was upstairs and i had no door. a sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my dad, his wife, and her two kids were watching tv. 

the desktop was right next to the staircase, but i figured that the tv was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. i was right.

but what i didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

i also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

i eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

and that's when i turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that i was casting a giant shadow puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. a perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. and i had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

so i did what anyone would do in that situation. i put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until i heard the tv come back on. then i went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

no one ever brought it up. and i'm thankful. but i know what they saw. and i'm still cringing.

tl;dr: got horny. got stupid. projected a masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. still embarrassed.

"for having an almanac?. a bit of backstory. i met my wife in the summer of 2008. she was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. i had gone to pick up some boxes because i was moving. out walked my sara...it was close to the end of her shift. and working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (seriously, i don't care what ddd says, that place is gross.) she was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...i'm pretty sure i fell in love right then and there that wonderful may night. (inb4 ""thats so old fashioned!!!"" don't care. when you know, you know.) i wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
it started after our first date. she had mentioned she loves lilacs. me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know jack or shit about flowers. but the way she talked about how much she loved them i knew i didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. so i wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (think what cops use to take notes.) this was the almanacs genesis. over the years i've written down information about my wife. her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. basically all the little things i knew i would forget. anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. i would go through it every once in a while so i could do something sweet for her. fast forward to yesterday morning.
i get a call from her around 11am. ""what the fuck is the almanac?"" (the almanac is written on the cover. it's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) she obviously has it, and i don't lie to my wife, so i tell her. she gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""i always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. i get home from work last night and she's really dejected. i asked her what's wrong and she says the almanac has cheapened every sweet thing i've ever done for her. she called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. mind you i've never showed it to a single soul nor have i even told anyone about it. until yesterday i was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (she also said she hasn't decided if i can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) i'm kind of heart broken. i feel like this should be an example of how much i love her. i'm terrified she's going to burn it. i want to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. that's why i write them down. i don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. i do it because i love my wife. i hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and i don't want to be that guy. so yeah, i took notes. and now i'm getting the silent treatment. or at best single word answers.

"tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto, ontario

i own an apartment in downtown toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with airbnb tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until january.

i decided to list my place up for a rental in late august, for rental until janaury. since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). i immediately got a hit by a person named jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.she signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""no short term rentals, through services such as airbnb"".

yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* on monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. along with a strong smell of pot. they apparently identified themselves as airbnb renters. (apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through airbnb).
* i am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* i am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

after getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on airbnb, using very recent photos of my apartment. i tried to contact jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

i have tried numerous times to talk to airbnb, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*edit\* i forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. i want to stop randoms from airbnb from entering my apartment now. ",2
"microwaving leftovers or a frozen meal? turn the power down and the timer up. 10mins at half power does a better job than 3 minutes on full throttle. food comes out looking like food!!!. seriously, microwaves only do a shit job if you're impatient. dial the power back, cook it for longer, and go choose your show on netflix or whatevs while it cooks - you know you're just gonna let it go cold while you choose a show anyway, so get on top of your shit, flip it and reverse it, choose the show first and enjoy your hot leftovers rather than choking down a cold soggy mess.

for example: a lean cuisine green curry & rice says on the box ""cook on high for 3 minutes let stand and serve"" - but it only says that because they know you're an impatient little shit and won't buy the box that says ""cook on 1/4 power for 12 minutes"" because if you're not going to cook your own calorie controlled curry, you're also not going to stand around waiting *twelve whole minutes* for this one when the *other* brand says it's done in three.

i apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. i posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested i ask on r/parenting. but i also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so i want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

first of all, i'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, i am not really in the best state of mind. my world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. i just want to write as much context as possible so i can get the best advice needed. for obvious reasons, i am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

background: i met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. we have 5 beautiful children together - really, i consider them a total blessing regardless of what i'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago i thought that we had the perfect marriage. we were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, i feel like i've done everything a loving husband should do. i am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant i work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but i want to stress that i've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. and never in a million years would i ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. and the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested i was not her father. she confided this to me privately, showing me the results and i could tell she was visibly upset by this. of course, the first thing i did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and i'll always love her unconditionally. but secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. it comes back and i am indeed not her biological father.

this news really broke me. i'm ashamed to say i broke down in tears in front of my daughter. the combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset i was making my daughter by how i was reacting. i really wish i had kept it in for her sake, but i didn't.

following this i asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. i wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, i could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. however i didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really i didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

we tell the other three what has happened, i reassure them that i love them unconditionally and that i'll always be there dad, but that i need to know how long this has been going on. god, i can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. they didn't care i wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken i was. i feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

so we have paternity tests for each of the three done. not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. which somehow made it worse. it's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? i can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

so i confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. she doesn't confess. she doesn't even take it seriously. she says the tests must be flawed. all four? how the hell am i supposed to take that seriously?

i keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. when i bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""we've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. but how am i supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

now that i have rambled and explained what has happened. i guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. how can i reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? i feel like the way i have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times i reassure them.

2. how do i handle my youngest daughter? i feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and i will need to tell my daughter something. i don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but i also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. is there anyway, anyway at all, you think i could or should save my marriage? i've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. i know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. if there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, i want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. wife refuses to confess her infidelity. unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

edit: thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. i have not replied to as many comments as i should have, but i've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. i'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. again, i can't begin to thank you for all your support. if this is resolved i might post an update, but if she continues to lie then i don't think i'll bother, as there's not much more i can add. from the advice in this and the r/parenting thread i've decided to:

1. get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. tell my youngest of the situation. ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. it will be entirely her decision.

4. i'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. my mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and i owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), i have not ruled out some form of counselling. but at the moment i think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

once again i'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

edit2: i guess i should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **how did the ancestry results suggests i wasn't her father?** my family is entirely irish. no relatives outside of ireland other than my immediate family, and i even have the stereotypical red hair. my daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the british isles/western europe/northern europe. that's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **which two children share the same father?** my two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **how did your wife conceive your children?** our eldest daughter was not planned. all the others were planned. each time we conceived several months after we started trying. our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. she was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually i agreed. she was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **are you infertile?** i don't know. i've never had a fertility test done. but the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that i might be. i will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

"update: i think my (22m) girlfriend (20f) might be cheating on me with my roommate.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/aj79wj/i\_think\_my\_22m\_girlfriend\_20f\_might\_be\_cheating/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aj79wj/i_think_my_22m_girlfriend_20f_might_be_cheating/)

tldr: my girlfriend was really close with my roommate, i suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

basically, after i kicked my gf out of our party, i assumed we would all lay low for a few days. i was wrong. the day after the party, my roommate (i decided to call him chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but i ignored him. less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing chet couldn't have been avoided, because while i was a good boyfriend, i study and sleep too much. ok. she then told me she would be willing to work through this if i was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. i didn't respond to the text.

that night i had a dinner with my parents i couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. i came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. i figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. wrong. i noticed later when chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into his room.

i haven't seen either of them, i think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. i don't even know how to feel. honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and i'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",8
"good news update! ca grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. brother sold his when they were worth a car. i left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. brother and his girlfriend want my half now.. mostly good news.

i worked with my dad and got my own lawyer.

i got the timeline of my shares wrong, but it comes out the same. what my brother and i inherited from my grandmother was originally part of my grandfather's portfolio, he was the money savvy one. my grandmother looked after those after he died and she personally set up my brother's accounts and gave him control of his part. she didn't do the same with mine before she died (i thought she had already set the accounts up for me and given control to dad before passing) instead the shares were in her will, and she left everything she owned to my dad with instruction that what was $15000 worth when my brother got his equivalent part would go to me when i was old enough to know how to take care of them. there was no trust, she just trusted my dad. my dad did the right thing and set up accounts for me and gave me control six years ago. my dad put some of his own shares in too as an extra leg up.

dad admitted to me he'd chewed out my brother last year when he came to him asking for money, and dad had supported him several times over the years and got to the point he'd had enough. my brother found out i still had my investments because dad had used me as an example of how brother should have been using money. that's how my brother found out i still had shares and they'd grown.

according to all that info my lawyer tells me i'm in the clear, but it's not going to get to the point of finding that out in court as my brother's gf was only a legal secretary. i say was because the firm she worked for apologised and informed my lawyer she was terminated immediately. the letter i received from them had been edited to put her name in a position higher up than it should have been, and some of the contact information had been changed.

a week after she was fired my brother visited me begging for money. his girlfriend is in serious debt and she took a chance on scamming cash from me and lost. i felt awful rejecting my own brother over and over, and if he hadn't involved his girlfriend needing an amount well into five figures i might have given him some. the next morning i found all my tires had been slashed. screw him, i don't feel bad any more.

the rest of the comments in the previous thread made me realise i don't know nearly enough about what i'm doing with the shares and dividends and money in general. a lot of the decisions i've made have been with dad's help and his advice has paid off well so far but not because i knew it would but because i had no idea what i was doing and left it up to him. i've booked in to work with a financial advisor to make the most of what i have. thanks for all your comments.",2
"for telling my brother to stop complaining about child support since he chose to have sex with a woman he barely knew?. my brother (26/m) has a one year old son with a woman he was never in a relationship with, apparently they were friends with benefits. 

long story short she got pregnant, he wanted her to abort and she refused, she had the baby, he got a dna test confirming he's the dad, now he pays child support. they share custody. 

i had dinner with him the other day and as usually he bitched about how child support is unfair, etc. i told him for the first time that it's his fault. he chose to have sex knowing the risk of pregnancy. he got mad and said it's not fair because women can abort but men can't, i told him he knew that before he has sex with her but he still risked it. he called me an asshole, but i was just being honest.

my son has moved back in with me last weekend.

the older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

i got a phone call from my son on saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

i jumped into my car and brought him home. i also yelled at the man and told him i'm calling the cops.

i then called an officer i knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

when we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

so while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

i'm happy he is rid of that predator but i'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

i have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

i hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

thank you to everyone for telling me i wasn't completely crazy.",3
"for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.. i'm(22m) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. we're very close and we have always been like that. he lives with me now obviously. he often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so i comfort him as best as i can. 

so, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. she doesn't live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn't wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. she woke us up and made a scene in front of him. she said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it's extremely concerning that he's so affectionate towards me. my brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. i brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

i went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. i told her to get the fuck out. she got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. i grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. i didn't hurt her, she was following me, i didn't use any force. she left, she called me few times but i didn't answer.


update: thanks for all the comments. i talked to her, she still said that she didn't do anything wrong,she didn't hurt my brother and it wasn't her fault that he started crying. i broke up with her. 

also little info: this doesn't happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. he laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.",3

"by creating a special handshake with my daughter (nsfw?). this is an ongoing tifu, i am actively looking for ways to end it.

my daughter is 3. she is the light of my life and all that. because she isn't much for drinking or golf, i have had to find activities we both enjoy to pass the day. this means we spend a great deal of time watching movies. my favorite is e.t. and i figured she'd love it too. wrong. e.t. is terrifying to a little girl. in an effort to make e.t. fun, i taught her the fingertip touch ""ouch"" thing and then we watched that scene a few times in a row. it went well and now e.t. no longer scares her. win.

she has held onto the fingertip touch and it has taken on a life its own, a bit like a not-at-all-secret handshake for us. we always do it before she goes to sleep.

her: *puts out finger* finger!

me: *touches finger* ouch!

super cute right? well... she has now taken to doing it anywhere, at any time. it became pretty annoying and when i tried to curb the frequency of it, i was met with disaster. last weekend we were at the mall when she announced loudly in a quiet jewelry store that she was going to give me the finger. a little embarrassing but not too bad. i told her that she can't say it like that because ""the finger"" sometimes means something bad. she nods, understanding and the moment passes. a few days later, at dinner with my in-laws, the handshake returns to the forefront of her mind. mid-meal, she says, ""finger! oh no wait, that's bad..."" she then thinks for a moment and screams, ""daddy, finger me!"" if i could have turned into a flock of birds and flown away forever, i would have. my in-laws turn bright red and stare at her. i immediately say, ""no no, that's not what its called"". my daughter doubles down, ""yes! finger me! ouch! remember? ouch!"" i nearly passed out.

we are now trying to rebrand the handshake as ""et"" and ""ouch"" because jesus christ i can't take her anywhere.

"for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after i told her not to?. my sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. i won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. i decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. she did not get her car fixed for some reason. she claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. my parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. i told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when i specifically tell her not to.

recently i've been needed to get to work very early and i really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so i told my sister she had 30 days until i took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. that was 32 days ago. yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). i called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this i reported it stolen.

"by leaving my dragon dildos out to dry nsfw. this is literally still happening. maybe it will continue for the rest of my life. maybe this is it for me.

so i live in an apartment-style dorm, but my roommates do not move in for a few more weeks so i am alone in my unit for now. this is very clear because there is a placard with my name and my name only on the front door.

this morning i woke up to the sounds of clanging and walking in my unit. i panicked before my mind supplied ""oh that's the janitor that comes to clean the bathrooms on monday's"". 

and i immediately suffer a heart attack.

it is wednesday. 

i was not expecting a janitor visit. 

in the tub, drying overnight, i had arranged a smorgasbord of sex toy delights: anal beads, a plug, and four dragon/monster dildos of increasing size. lined up. like little sex soldiers.

i hear her open the door to the bathroom, and i lay in the bed in my locked room quiet and still. maybe i'll can stop existing.

i hear some noise, and what sounds like talking.

a few minutes later i hear my ra walk in. i hear some comments and some laughter. they quietly convene for what feels like a long while. the ra simply laments ""why?!"" and the  janitor asks if any boys live in the unit. i continue not to breathe. there are four bedrooms and they don't know which one i use and all the doors are closed so if i continue to be quiet i can astral project off this plane of existence without them noticing.

i currently hear the sounds of a spray bottle, occasionally followed by bag rustling and the tell-tale sound of unsticking a six pound hunk of silicon from a tub. i don't know when she'll leave, if ever. i think i'll be trapped here forever, sweating under the covers from anticipation and embarrassment while she talks and laughs and cleans around my monster dildos.

please send me instructions on how to dissolve into the floor, thanks and have a lovely afternoon.

tl;dr: left all my sex toys out overnight so of course the janitor made a surprise visit this morning and invited the ra to come look at my dragon cocks.

-- / -- / -- / -- / --

update: oh my god this absolutely blew up. i'm going to give an update and answer some questions because i think my phone is going to explode.

-- i emerged from my room about an hour later, my toys were as i left them and there was cleaner in the toilet, so my understanding is that the janitor cleaned the bathroom and perhaps lifted the toys to clean underneath them. i rinsed my things and put them hidden in a drawer in my room. i was waiting to update because i half-expected some communication from my ra but this hasn't happened. sorry the ending isn't juicier but honestly i wouldn't have been able to handle it so i'm thankful.

-- the janitor coming in unannounced is standard procedure. i still have no clue why the ra was allowed in; i'm starting to believe maybe it was, in fact, another janitor? the voice was hushed and i may have misidentified it.

-- a lot of you want pics of the toys. i have a pic of the four in question in a post i made a month or so ago. yes i recommend them, yes they are worth the money.

-- i am ftm, so i am a guy but i currently still have my vagina. i didn't mention my sex or gender because for many reasons it was irrelevant to the story. i put the toys wherever i decide i want them. this clarification is here so that discussion and speculation in the comments is no longer necessary. comments about this aren't going to spark fun or interesting conversations so if you want to argue go do it on a debate forum, not on a funny dildo story.

yesterday was our anniversary. we had a small celebratiion. when we were about to sleep, my wife started crying. i was really worried because i did not understand why. she hugged me and told me that she wanted to confess something. she ended up telling me that she faked her love for me when we were dating. she also told me that she cheated on me when we were dating. but she fell in love with me a couple of years after we got married. she told me that she really matured at that time and realised that i was the mist important person in her life. she also claims that she never cheated on me once we got married. she told me because she really felt guilty. she told me that she would do everything to make it up.

"for stranding a date without a ride because she was ignoring me?. so last weekend i went on a tinder date with a girl who i've been chatting to for a while. it was our second date and i thought things were going pretty well.

we end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which i recommended. it was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. i awkwardly try to join in but i'm basically ignored. i leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. they're still chatting. i stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. they back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

at this point i go out and grab a smoke. she comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn't seen this guy in ages. i tell her that's cool but i'm just gonna head home soon. she asks me to wait for her bc she doesn't have a ride and it's far from home. 

so i wait bc whatever, night is ruined and i might as well just hang out. i wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her i'm going home and she can either come with me or stay. i see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. i try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. i gesture to her that i'm going and she holds up a finger like ""wait a minute"" and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. 

i've had it at this point and i just text her ""leaving now, bye"" and head straight to my car and leaves. i get frantic calls about 15 min later. she asks me where i am and if i could go back and pick her up since she doesn't have a ride and her friend doesn't live close to her like i do. i say ""no"" and hang up. 

anyways the next day i get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. she's upset because i left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can't get uber/lyft for some reason. she calls me a pos and to never call her again and that she'll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me.

i wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love i received from people in this sub i feel like the least i can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. before i begin i just want to thank everyone who gave advice, i didn't respond to everyone but i read almost every response. i stopped reading my pm's because a lot of the messages i was getting were graphic and negative but i appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and i'm sorry if i didn't respond to you. now on to the update: 

it's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. my bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time i decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. i felt like everything i needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. his sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

we spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. he told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while i was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when i first suggested it. he said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (i don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when i brought up his tattoo. obviously i knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but i must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because i never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

i was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. he regrets the tattoo and discovering i wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. he apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. he completely understood where i was coming from when i brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

i apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what i meant and was very forgiving. he apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

we then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

up until now i was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. apparently she felt like i was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

if that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. we're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

my bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. she was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. we've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

in the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. in the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. i'm a fan of this idea as well. 

as for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. i don't think he should, i feel like he's lost enough family but i'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

i think that just about wraps everything up. a huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

i mean this in the nicest way possible when i say i hope i never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - we both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. we're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",8

"tifu- by not knowing about sunblock expiration dates. i applied spf 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. i was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

i pretty much had no idea that i had a problem until i scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. i considered for a split second that i had a burn but like an idiot, i rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

the blisters formed by the next day and i started reading the can to see if i missed something about applying it. i found the customer service number and called it. before talking to anyone, i heard a recording tell me that the fda doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. this bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

i had no clue. 

i went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

it was easily one of the most painful things i have ever experienced. except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. i soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


this was preventable- sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions.

edit- i want to clear up: i'm naturally, very pale person, i was at high altitude while on and in the water. i do not blame anyone but myself for this. whether expired or i stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. i should have been careful with making sure the things i use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
i agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, i just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
this isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

i'm not planning to sue anyone although i appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
i just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! be safe! skin cancer is a real danger.

"my wife (f30) told me that she cheated on me (m28) and i honestly don't know what to do. we have been married for over 5 and a half years. i love her so much. we finally got our own place on december 2018 and things were looking up for us. these 5 years were so magical and i always told myself that through all of our trials in life, that i would marry her again.

this past tuesday, my lead told us that we can vto  (volunteer time off. i work night shift) so my co worker gave me a ride home. (my wife and i share a car). when he dropped me off, i noticed that our car wasn't parked in our parking spot. i thought that she parked somewhere else.

as soon as i went inside, i went to our bedroom so that i can kiss her and surprise her and let her know that i am home. the plan was to make her breakfast before she woke up to go to work.

she wasn't in the room. she wasn't home. so i called her and asked her where she was. when she answered, she sound like she just woke up.

my heart broke because i had a feeling of what was going on. she made an excuse that she was at the store to get balloons for co-worker's birthday. i gave her the benefit of the doubt.

so i was in bed and she finally got home after 30 minutes of waiting. she sat on the bed and i asked her if she was okay. she wouldn't answer and began to cry. then after 5 minutes of asking of what's going on, she told me that she cheated on me. she said that she went out and talked to someone, got drunk and it just happened.

i am sad. i honestly thought this would never happen to me. i don't know what to do. we had a long talk about our marriage and what we would do. we agreed that we would try to work it out, but at this time, 9/6 at 0545, i am strongly considering in divorcing her. i can't even look at her anymore. the thought of hugging her, kissing her, touching her makes me sick to my stomach. she wants to work it out, but my heart isn't in it anymore.

what should i do? am i overreacting?  i honestly thought of killing myself. i am so sad. she was my everything.

tldr;   wife confessed to cheating. i am so sad. thinking of killing myself.  what do i do?

thank you

edit to say: just got back from my long ass walk since posting this (0500 pst) i am so surprised for the support! <3

thanks to all that replied to me with your advice. i still love her and ultimately, even though it is tough for me,  i forgive her. time will heal this pain and honestly, i love her too much to end this.  we have been through so much and have so many wonderful memories. i honestly can't imagine being with another person.  she is truly sorry that she cheated on me. most wont agree with this, but i will give her another chance and see where this goes.

and no, i wont kill myself. i promise.  i really appreciate your concerns and replies. it makes me happy that you all took time out of your busy lives to reply to me. take care everyone and i'll update as time goes on.. <3

\*\*\*update 09/13:\*\*\*

i have been reading the comments. i understand that to most it is stupid that i am still with her. i understand. trust me. we have been talking a lot. she is truly sorry and i forgive her. i put her mistake behind me and i am looking forward in fixing our marriage.  we plan on going to therapy soon so that we can talk it out. the reason why we haven't gone yet is because we have to work because there are bills that we are paying off (we will be debt free by the end of 2019.) but we will go sometimes next week.

&#x200b;

we are working this out. we are still living together. we are communicating more and more about what we need to do to improve our marriage and love life. honestly, it has been going well. things are looking up because soon, i will be transferring to day shift so that i can spend time with her, sleep with her and have the normal schedule that i have been longing for. i still want her in my life and i don't see divorce. we will work this out.

again, thank you all for helping me in my time of need. i am really grateful that you all took the time in giving me advice. it helps. ill update as time goes on. <3",8

"my truck was stolen and later found but the police did not notify me until 6 weeks later, at which point the tow yard had already sold it at auction. wa state. my truck ('87 beater, not worth much but very important to me as a spent a lot of time fixing it up) was stolen in mid october. i immediately filed a police report and checked back in several times with the police for updates, but was told if any tow yard received it the police would know and would notify me. 

fast forward to last friday, i receive a call from the police saying my truck was recovered... on november 1! six weeks prior! from my conversation with the very apologetic dispatcher, it seems like they messed up and forgot to notify when it was found, but never admitted to that explicitly.

i called the lot it was sent to, and was informed that per their policy the vehicle was held for 29 days and then sold at auction. a later phone called revealed it was sold on nov 24, after only 23 days, which i would think is illegal. apparently the towing company sends a letter to your address, but i had just moved out of my old place not 2 weeks prior to the theft and heard nothing. i had no idea it had even been recovered!

all i really want is my truck back, which i don't think will happen, but all of this just seems wrong to me. am i entitled to compensation? and from whom? the towing company sold it before it's stated 29-day policy, but the police made no effort to contact me. do i have legal recourse here?

i have tried to speak with police but cannot get in touch with their ""complaint hotline"" until tomorrow. same situation with the towing company.
any advice greatly appreciated.",2

"if your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse.. 
imo a dr or teacher should be able to contact cps for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

last night i saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. it broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

i don't know their circumstances and for the most part, i am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. however, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). a child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

these poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

edit: thank you for mentioning the factors i naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. these points are very valid and make a lot of sense. perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

i had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

as anyone, i am speaking from my own experience and i did come from a family who struggled with money. i don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced. 

 i think we need positive ideas of ways we can help prevent this problem. my doctor's office has material for families about healthy eating. i have seen free ""classes"" offered in the community for families about healthy eating. 

edit 2: i remembered more of our eating habits as a child. we had a garden, my dad's friend gave him grain that we ground up in a vitamix for flour, we ate a lot of rice, beans, veggies. we also spent a lot of time outside. all in all, education is a huge influencer and effort makes a difference!

also for the love of god everyone saying this is a popular opinion should read the comments because a good portion disagree with me. yay for a lively debate!",6

"my (22m) gf(26f) of 5 years killed my pet snake (14 yo) as soon we moved in together. update on the bottom

update #2 on the bottom

update #3 on the bottom

so i'm pretty much convinced my gf killed my snake that i had since i was kid. 

she always had a problem with the snake, she would believe its satanic and bad omen to have a snake in the house. 

but to me the snake was like family, and is very docile. he has no problems with her dogs, he just be chilling. even her dog would just chill, not attack my snake.

when we were moving she kept telling me to get rid of the snake but i couldnt cuz i really love my snake.

well now i came home and the snake was just gone, no traces of anything just gone and not tp be seen in the house. 

when i confronted my gf about it she claims she doesnt know anything and claims that it probablt escaped.

i find this hard to believe because first off he actually cant escape his enclosure, and i doubt the snake went down a flight of stairs and left through the door.

i dont wanna make a big deal out of it but i think its mad fucked up she did this.

i wanna confront her about it but i dont wanna seem like im being petty

edit: when i brought up the snake missing she just started crying and saying i always do this?? idek what she even means by this



update: she dmd me this (im out rn)

update 2: i went to the lake to search with my friend i was chilling with, couldn't find the snake, and talk to the gf. were currently on break but were in the same house... not sure how thats gonna pan out

update 3: didnt sleep all night, went to the lake (15 minute drive), and i found the snake but unfortunatly it looks like it got attacked by another animal as it has huge marks on him and looks impaled. well with the gf, i am going to break up with her and go no contact but right now i have to find a way to get my name off lease papers and other documents too

"private driveway being used as public roadway and im being accessed for its upkeep (fl). purchased 30 acres of land and built a house several years back in central florida, had a driveway installed that cuts across the center of my property allowing me to exit on either of two main roads.

i now have traffic using my driveway as a shortcut between the two roads up to and including 18 wheelers and other large vehicles since using my driveway cuts off nearly half an hour of travel time between two cities.

i installed pillars and gates on both ends of the driveway and marked it private property but the gates were torn down and the pillars knocked over.

i have contacted the county about it and they sent out a guy from code compliance who looked around for a few minutes and left.

i have now received a notice about not keeping the roadway to state standards and that the county will be out to perform maintenance bringing the roadway up to standards, ie. widening it and repaving which i will be personally responsible for paying for.

ive told them if they want it to be a public road then fine buy me out and ill move elsewhere but they refuse to do so.

as of right now i have removed half the driveway past my house and put up signs and markers stating dead end road and now the county is threatening to have me arrested for destruction of public property.

&#x200b;

before anyone asks, no, there are no easements on this property anywhere near the area the driveway goes through and no easements in any form that travel in that direction on the property, closest thing is a power company easement along the southern edge of the land.

county has basically turned my private property into public land without using eminent domain and without any compensation.

"by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital nsfw. i'm still trying to process what just happened. today was my daughters 19th birthday and i wanted to surprise her by coming home early with a cake. i brought the cake home, slowly tip-toed to her room to surprise her and heard something i will never unhear. she was having sex with her boyfriend and saying ""please stop it hurts, stop it."" i ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. i was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. i threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. my daughter was frantically explaining to me that it's a fetish and he wasn't actually hurting her. i told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and i rushed him to the hospital. he's doing okay now and isn't suffering any major injuries but i feel awful. i'm not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and i truly thought he was hurting her.

"fat women should stop calling themselves curvy or thick. i'm so sick of overweight/obese women in the 'body rights'/haes movement referring to themselves as curvy or thick instead of fat. i'm not the thinnest girl in the world, but i'm well inside the 'normal' bmi range (bmi of 21) and yes my thighs do save lives. i work out, i eat healthy, i have learned to control my urges and i take pride in taking care of my body. it irks me that these overweight women just go around calling themselves curvy when it should be used to describe women with a somewhat healthy body and larger boobs and ass.  because of this, i find myself wondering what a guy really means when he tells me i'm curvy or thick. ffs, you're fat! if you're so proud of the glutton you are then you should have no problem in calling yourself fat. rant over. 

edit: for all these kind commenters that keep asking me why i care, it's because being comfortable with obesity as a community will only lead to an even higher economic strain, and a generally unhealthy society. fat is fat. not curvy, just fat. there are already media 'personalities' that endorse being comfortable with their bodies (look up glitterandlazers on youtube, she's the kind of woman my post is addressing). i simply don't think it's the best outlook and if you're so happy with your body you shouldn't have to use blanket terms like curvy. thanks to you, now the word has negative connotations. but hey, if calling me insecure/a bitch makes you feel better, go ahead :) ",6
"my faith in humanity isn't restored when i see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen. call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. disabled people and bullied people aren't your charity case.. you see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, ""there are still good people in this world. she was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen."" or ""star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate"". sure it seems sweet at first but when i think about it all i can see is someone doing something ""nice"" for their own personal gain. when these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? who gets the interviews and good press? why, the people who did the ""good deed"" of course. most of the time it seems like they don't give a damn about the person who they did something ""nice"" for, instead it's about ""look what we did! we are so nice! we are so good hearted!"" it's all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it's almost never about the person it should be about. it's not sweet and heartwarming, it's almost sort of heartbreaking because i've seen instances where people will do ""nice things"" for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. it was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. if you want to do something nice do it when nobody's looking and don't accept any congratulations for your good deed.

eta: like i said in a reply to a commenter, sure its a ""nice thing to do"" and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it's a nice gesture all around, but disabled people aren't mindless angel pets. they have brains and lots of them don't like to feel pitied or patronized. especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. i'm not saying ""don't ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives"" i am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. also if you're gonna do something nice for someone make sure you're being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. don't be nice one day and then cruel the next. i know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that's not my main issue here. the motive isn't the issue either, it's the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. instead of mistreating someone, doing one ""nice"" thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. my issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. i really don't give that much of a shit about ""prom queen"" or shit like that anyway, i'm using it as an example. i'm almost 20 years old and when i was younger i never ran for those positions anyhow. another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. that way he won't feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. make him feel like he's not a helpless invalid.",6

"by telling my son's new doctor we are anti-vaxx. obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

my son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. we decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. i brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which i reply, ""oh, no he can't have that, i don't want him to get autism.""

i should maybe note here that i am an aspie too, and while i think my sarcasm is on point, i must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. the silence lasted an eternity while i imagine she was deciding how to proceed. eventually i laughed and tried to assure her i was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

as my son and i were discussing whether i was offensive (he thought i was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. he started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. he just kept saying, ""okay, well i have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. 

tl;dr: jokingly told my son's new doctor that i didn't want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.

edit: of course we took the gardasil. shout out to nurse pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. i wish everyone could have a nurse pete. also, since i'm editing, thanks for the awards!",4

friday night, one of my friends called me and told me he was watching my girlfriend kissing another guy at one of the bars in the area. it's a place her and i don't really frequent, but many of my friends go there on the weekends. since it was crowded, he didn't think she saw him. apparently a little while later, his girlfriend shows up there and sees my girlfriend hanging with this guy they don't recognize, then watching as they kiss again. she never came home saturday morning, ended up coming back around 1 in the afternoon.

there is no reason either of them would lie to me, i've been friends with the guy since 6th grade and with his girlfriend since they started dating 4 years ago. both super nice people.

i confronted my girlfriend about it last night and she freaked, calling them liars, calling me manipulative, and (after initially denying there was another guy) calling the other guy ""just a friend"". i went to work about an hour later and came home a few hours ago. all of her stuff is gone, which is fine with me because i don't believe her and i think she was cheating. worse though, she took my fire safe which contains an emergency credit card, about $700 in cash, my social security card, my passport and the title to my truck. her name isn't on my bank account thankfully but it looks like she's trying to clean me out, how would i proceed?",8

"4 years ago today, i shared the worst joke i ever created. here it is again for those that missed it.. there are two identical twin brothers that live together. one happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job. instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home. one saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot. he tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food. after some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store. in the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off. he turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.  
  
about 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store. his vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving. an ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital. he ends up in the emergency room under observation, but his condition is critical. they try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.  
  
the dentist wakes to a knock on the door. suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues. eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door. when he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper. he is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.  
  
the grim reaper swears. ""oh no! this always happens with identical twins"".  
  
""what do you mean?"" asks the dentist.  
  
""well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and i've come to take him to the underworld. i'm afraid his time on earth has ended. i'll take my leave now.""  
  
the dentist is noticeably upset. he says ""wait! isn't there some way i can challenge you for my brother's life? after all, you made the mistake. certainly there must be a way i can bargain for his life.""  
  
the grim reaper asks ""what do you have in mind?""  
  
the dentist thinks. ""how about a challenge? if i beat you, you let my brother go free.""  
  
the grim reaper laughs. ""i will beat you in any challenge. what challenge do you propose?""  
  
the dentist smiles. ""i propose we see who has the cleanest teeth. 5 minutes of brushing each, then we decide.""  
  
""very well"" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.  
  
once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull. it's glistening. he takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes. after 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright. the grim reaper grins. ""you are foolish human. but, you are entitled to your chance.""  
  
the dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman. when his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste. he smiles.  
  
it's unbelievable.  
  
the shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.  
  
the winner is obvious. the grim reaper hangs his head in shame. ""you win, human. this time. your brother will live."" he disappears in a puff of smoke. at the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital. not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy. suddenly, the phone by his bed rings. it's his brother, the dentist. he picks up. ""hey bro. you'll never believe what happened. apparently, i went out to the market and got hit by a car. they say i almost died.""  
  
the dentist smiles on the phone and says. ""that's interesting, bro. today you might say that i also had a brush with death.""",0

"purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. now what? ny, putnam county. mostly what's in the title. condo was vacant for roughly 60 days between closing and our attempt to move in. upon getting there with our belongings, we discovered a new deadbolt on the door - the unit was vacant and had no deadbolt when we did our final walkthrough the day before closing. tried knocking on the door. got no answer, reached out to our realtor, who contacted the seller's agent and asked that he get in touch with his client to find out what the hell is going on, but at this point we assumed squatters. about an hour later, a young man showed up and produced a 36 month lease  which had been paid in advance. all $1 of it. he told us it's between us and his uncle, and headed into the apartment.

our realtor is flabbergasted; he's encountered squatters and tenants who had to be evicted after refusing to leave at the end of the lease, but never anything like this. the police won't touch this either, which makes perfect sense given the context - dude has a lease that predates our contract (albeit by one day) so as far as they're concerned it's a civil matter. the condo association is incredibly hands-off about owners leasing their properties (which is part of why this place was appealing, as i plan to rent it out myself when we are ready to buy a house), so they want nothing to do with the situation.

to me it seems like the lease should be completely void given that it was executed in ridiculously bad faith, but i am nowhere near a lawyer. to that end, the attorney who handled the transaction for us is out of town till next week - my understanding is that he's camping or hiking or hunting or something along those lines and is basically incommunicado for the time being, but i am waiting to hear back from his admin to get details (he's a one man firm so there are no associates that can help me in the interim).

i have no idea what to do here. luckily the truck we were using to move is owned by a friend's business, and they have graciously offered to let us store our belongings in it while we get this sorted. unluckily, my wife and i turned in the keys to our old apartment this morning, and as such we have nowhere to go.

i'd be willing to do a cash for keys thing to get this guy out of our apartment but he won't speak to us. beyond that, do i have grounds to evict him? if so, how do i recoup the expenses associated with this whole clusterfuck, sue the seller? does the tenant have any sort of liability here? if i do pull of a successful cash for keys arrangement, can i sue the seller for that as well? what about the friend who is letting us keep all of our stuff in one of his trucks, does he have any grounds to sue or does the fact he is voluntarily letting us use the truck take that out of the equation? is there anything else that i am not thinking of?

i am shaking with anger right now so i apologize for this being a bit of a a rambling novel, and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

edit: location is new york, specifically putnam county.

**update (4:45pm):** i just got a call from my attorney's admin. he's apparently close enough to civilization to have an internet connection in his cabin and should be checking in with her shortly, at which point she'll have him reach out to me. apparently he was a civil litigator before he ""retired"" to real estate law, and she thinks he'll welcome an excuse to step into his old shoes and tear these people apart. needless to say i am looking forward to hearing from him.

**update 2 (5:25pm):** just heard from both my realtor and my attorney. the evening seems to have found a way to get even more interesting, but the truck owning friend is about five minutes out with my car. we're going to meet my realtor for dinner, my closing documents and some badly needed drinks (said the guy who doesn't really drink). i'll update tomorrow morning if not tonight, but till then... thank you thank you thank you for the advice and reassurance. wish me luck!",2
"not sure how to deal with my 37f anti-vaxx husband 35m since i want to get our kids vaccinated. at first i assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  we were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

it's been 6 years. six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

first, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

at 1 year i pushed to vaccinate but was met with his ""uncertainty."" 

today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and i decided to take her to the er.  

thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

he said all the things i've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. he explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

i tried to explain that i agree, but i feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes i was respecting up until now.

he ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

on the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

i look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

i won't do this anymore. although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

can i just take them myself?  we always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

what can i say so he won't go? how can i keep this form him, or should i tell him once it's done?

reddit i need encouragement and suggestions what to do. 

please help

edit: for the people who are down voting::

if i was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. help me help my children this is no different. for those of you that have always agreed with your spouse on this, you are lucky. i thought he would eventually let them get vaccines but now it's just excuse after excuse.",8

i used to like ed sheeran and same with marvel at first. but at some point they both realized that people will buy their creationd no matter how lazily writtren they are. and i think we should try to be more critical of them because that will lead to them making better art.

"for grounding my daughter because she called my sil a ""slut""?. my daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. a boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. i believe he sent a video to her as well. before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. it appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. i notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200b;

my husband and i are respectful and non-judgmental of my sil's profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. my daughter is understandably upset and i feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. she unfriended my sil from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. she refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my sil house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. i tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200b;

my sil is hurt from all of this. not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. last weekend, i went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. my daughter refused and referred my sil as ""a vapid slut"" and her husband ""a pathetic cuck"" along with other slurs i don't want to repeat.

&#x200b;

i grounded her for three months and took away her internet. my husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that's too much. he also admitted he struggled accepting his sister's career path at first. he thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200b;

edit: seems like my husband is right and i went too far with the punishment. i just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. i'm going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. will decide with the husband later. we're definitely concerned for our daughter about what's happening at school and we're looking into therapy.

for clarification, as for my sil's privacy, she didn't consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",3
"by letting this subreddit devolve into a collection of creative erotica writing assignments meta. i don't know if meta threads are allowed, but i think this needs to be said. i believe the removal of the ""nsfw only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. the majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting tifus that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, tifus that are actually not tifus at all and serve only as humble brags - by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool i am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.

when you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling op out for the story obviously being fake/barely a (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so i really doubt i am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.

tl;dr: personally i think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the nsfw weekend rule. these post clearly have their audience so i have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. however i don't think it's fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day.",4

im 17. i have saved up 40k (legal money) throughout my life. 
i want my mom and dad to receive 50/50 of the money. 
do i need to sign some contract to make sure it happens or does the bank automatically split the money between my parents? (its my own account, neither are co owners).
i cant ask my parents on it, since they are in denial that im dying and refuse to talk about anything relating the fact that im dying. 
also what about life insurance? is it possible for me/my parents to take a life insurance on me even though its a official fact that im dying?

advice pls?",2
"by matching with my homophobic uncle on grindr. so i have an uncle (we will call him j) who has always been very vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. there is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

well this weekend in between family gatherings i was looking to meet somebody . i started chatting with an older man because that's how i roll. a lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so i don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. we actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics i wish i could unsee and sending a few i wish i could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

so i'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . it is at this moment i realize my fu, i've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  he tried to play it off like a random encounter but i wasn't letting him get away with that. after some pressing he finally admits that he is the man i've been talking to and i told him i don't judge him like he does me . he apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

he kept talking with me like he was still interested and i had to make it clear that was not going to happen . i had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him i had to go ahead and block his number. i can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

always get a face pic, people.

tl:dr: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . should have insisted on the face pic

edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but i'll answer some pressing questions . i did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who i was . it is pretty disturbing to say the least. as far as blackmail goes i have everything saved but i don't plan on doing anything with it as i think that could actually put me in danger . this man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

"just had a natural gas company clear 2 acres of our land to build a well on my property. 1 days notice before the bulldozers starting clearing everything. not a cent negotiated to compensate the lots we already agreed to sell to home builders. north of houston, texas.. pissed off. https://imgur.com/gallery/k2tlf2k

apparently they are going after gas 1/2 mile east of our property but there was no road to the location so they are directional drilling from our property. we've paid an engineering firm to plat out our land to home builders, those plans were expensive and are worthless now. no one will buy a house with a gas well out their back door, lost every buyer we had lined up. 

we haven't been paid a cent nor have they called us back to negotiate the cost of damages, trees taken, lot buyers that have now backed out, and acreage they have taken.

"i (28m) with fiance (27f) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous ex was the best lover she ever had. it was quite by accident that i heard this.  we had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  some of us were in one room playing texas holdem and a couple of others were watching a lord of the ring marathon.  i thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  our group had run out of soda so i got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  as i'm rounding the corner i hear my fiance talking and before i completely come in the room i hear her clearly say ""jason is great but he will never be the lover that bill was"" she then followed it up with ""its not really fair to jason though, bill was just really gifted down there"".

at first i thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but i decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and i could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know i was there.  of course she has no idea i heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how i'm doing and if i'm having fun.  i was tempted to say something like ""i'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but i didn't.  i just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  i just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

needless to say it fucked me up.  i mean fucked me up bad.  i've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  i couldn't sleep that night and i went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  at first i was angry.  then i was humiliated.  then i was depressed.  then i was angry again.

look i realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  i would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

i tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on i just kept getting worse and worse.  i was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  that is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and i flat out rejected her.  it wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  i had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  but in the moment instead of being sexually aroused i felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

she asked me what was wrong and i just told her i must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

so much to my humiliation there i laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  i came clean and told her what i heard.

well this did not go over well at all.  at first she tried to tell me i did not hear her correctly.  but i just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  which once again i am sure was more of a big turn off for her because i was a wreck emotionally.

she tried to tell me how much of a better person i was and how i satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  but all i could hear was charlie browns teacher noise.

it's been almost a month and i have zero desire to be with her sexually.  none.  she is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what i have tried i just can not get past this.  it's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  she clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  well i know i can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  but no matter what i do i can't grow in size.  obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me i won't believe her.  she's most likely right.

some back story here.  he dumped her.  it was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  i know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  she said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  so this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  if he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  now i have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but i don't think she would.

i just don't know what to do here.  i can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  i know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that i think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told i am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  like what would happen if i lost my good paying job or better yet what if i were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  basically what i feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  i know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what i feel.

i'm sorry for the length here and i don't even know what i am asking here.  i am totally lost and if this continues i just think i am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and i need advice.

&#x200b;

edit:  holy god.  i made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  i have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  i don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  i am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  also thank you for the gold and silver kind internet strangers.

edit 2:  dear god.  i read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking i had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5k more posts.  i'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   i was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  i haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have i opened any of the 20 chat screens.  there are issues i want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  she was to use the barney gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  in other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  nope, neither of us drink.  we don't even have it in the house.
2. that i am upset she told her friend.  well this is an odd thing, before i posted this honestly i wasn't that upset about this part.  i was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  however now reading a lot of the post i have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  i would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. that i am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  well i'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  but the last part is just out of my control.  no matter what i do i will only ever be 7"" long.  we have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  she said that i was already great with everything but the one thing i can't control. (okay, so i gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. no i'm not going to do anything rash.  it's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  but yes i have to decide what i am going to do here before long.  it's not fair to either of us is i am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. she is sorry that i heard it.  she said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if i didn't catch her saying it.  it is what it is.  but yes i do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since i first told her.  me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  i don't know how much of that i believe but right now i guess i don't know why she would lie.  it really has wrecked hell on our christmas spirit this year i know that. 

edit 3:  engineer for those who keep asking what i do for a living.  she is a paralegal.  
edit 4:  people have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how i know she was heartbroken.  we met about 9 months after they separated.  i know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  he just ended things so he could be with another woman.  she approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  on our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  it was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but i did it.  we sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time i never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates i tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because i didn't want to commit either.  after close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  obviously that was our first night together.  within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  so yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  i had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

"adults who have an unholy obsession with anything disney, have a worse personality than a horse girl/car guy.. don't get me wrong, i love disney as much as any twenty something, but some people take it too far. 

every person i've ever met with an alarming obsession with anything disney related is always the worst person to have a conversation with. everything always tracks back to disney somehow. theres no personality except for disney. they want their wedding to be disney, they have disney tattoos, or disney objects splattered through their home. and the worst. posting disney memes on their facebook, twitter, instagram. etc. its too much man. get a hobby.

i wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. it has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt i have been facing. he really had me questioning this entire situation and whether i was overreacting or not. i am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. i can update again afterwards.
thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. even if my opinion isn't valid to him, at least it's valid to all of you!


i don't want to cause any political debates. if it's necessary for context: obviously i believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

i'm so confused, i don't know what to think. i'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but i just feel that i need some advice.

in the time i have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so i thought. politics was never an issue between us at all. however he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are american) and that they should not be allowed to vote... he says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

i'm upset and i can't tell if i'm wrong to be upset about this because i know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now i just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. he has assured me that he still thinks that i should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

this is a person i have been with for almost 5 years. we've talked about marriage. i don't know what to think. in all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and i can't imagine my life without him in it. but this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

am i wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? as his girlfriend am i supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though i may (strongly) disagree? i can't tell if i'm overreacting to this or not. the whole situation has made me feel terrible and i'm so confused.",8

"by having sex for the first time in 2.5 years nsfw. obligatory, this didn't happen today, rather three days ago.


i've been single now for three years and haven't knocked boots with anyone in at least 2 so, finally fed up with celibacy and buffered by my friends success story, i joined a dating site.  


i started talking to this pretty good looking guy. he was a little boring, we didn't have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on thursday evening. he looked exactly as he did on his profile (6""8' power lifter who looked like a legit viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that i hadn't been catfiished but i was pretty sure i didn't want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. that said, he didn't seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so i invited him back to mine. 


it started well and i was like fuck yes, let's do this! so i said as much. i also said you're not going to call me back if we do this are you? he said he would. he's a liar. so bullet dodged. 


anyway, he proceeds to pick me up like i weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (i'm pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. i'm like strip because i've gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. at this juncture, i realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but i figure babies come out of there so i'm grand.



there's a warm up wristy and a little spiderman and then we get down to bi'ness. it's over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so i open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he's just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. 


so i'm trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have i got a tissue? my first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse. 


blood.jpeg


so much fucking blood. well, i know it's not a wild period since i'm not afflicted with that shit. i run to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. i'm like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. meanwhile i've never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. 


we have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. i clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. like it'll stop. 


nope. next day is agony and still going. trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know i went on a date and i don't want them thinking i'm some harlot. i'm still optimistic at this point that it'll stop.


wake up saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. but like fresh, bullet wound type blood. and i felt so sick and dizzy. i'm freaking the fuck out. obviously can't tell my mum because catholic shame so i go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who i think thought i had been raped because i was crying so much because i've broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever i think for too long about how this is probably the last time i'll ever have sex and it wasn't even that good. mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she's wonderful.


get in to see the doctor. after a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it's determined that i have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it's on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. brilliant.

theres surgical glue on my vagina. i'm never dating again.

tl;dr: had sex with a giant viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together.

"toxic femininity is worse than toxic masculinity. in recent years we have seen a rise in complaints relating to the behaviour of men and how it can be construed as toxic. the current movements have brought a deeper focus towards this and have created changes, some for the better and some for the worse. but during this time the very people marching against man have completely ignored their own toxic behaviours and a failure to address these would be worry some. women seem to want equality, but do not want to change their own bad behaviours.

when you think of toxic masculinity you are primarily speaking about mansplaining, manspreading, sexual violence or the boys will be boys argument. the whole movements seems to target the role of men as the dominant sex.

&#x200b;

but when you look at toxic femininity there is a much wider scope of problems that show up. a lot of toxic behaviours can easily outweigh most of what these people consider to be toxic masculinity. a few examples being;

* blaming behavioural issues on periods
* acting helpless at times where some physically demanding or unpleasant task comes up
* coercing men into sex who didn't seem to really want it and feeling as though you were at liberty to do so because ""men always want it""
* backed up by studies, women are far more likely to threaten harm to themselves, others or property if a man attempts to leave a relationship
* being physically abusive to men while expressing ""men can't hit women"" and being less likely to face any legal consequences for doing so
* lying about pregnancies or being on birth control to see how a man would respond or to manipulate them into staying
* manipulating divorce and custody battles by falsely insisting that a man has been abusive to you or a child.

&#x200b;

some of these examples are minor toxic offences, like blaming bad behaviour on hormones. it's normal, it happens, but it is no excuse all the same. some of these examples are major toxic offences. such as using your gender or children as a weapon to influence decision to go your way.

one of the most common offences of toxic femininity is attempting to convince the world that toxic femininity does not exist.

"am i a loser for being a virgin at 27 years old?. i was born in vietnam and moved to the us when i was 23. i had some girls interested in me during college (in vietnam) but we never made a move because you know, it's vietnam and it's the cultural thing back then. then i moved to the us. haven't found anyone since. there's so few asian in my city let alone vietnamese. my college is full of white and latins (demographics). don't get me wrong i don't mind dating out of my race but college folks here seem to keep to themselves, even men. i made some friends but as soon as semester ends they all go their own path. some even deleted my number and ignored me. and it seems like all women are taken. in the end maybe it's because i'm not good looking (short, dark skin, average looking face). i also have moderate depression & anxiety. 


then people made fun of me when they knew i'm a virgin. even my relatives laughed behind my back too.

i made a post in a tech subreddit. not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. 

i know it might not be a big deal. but i felt so down after that. i felt like i should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world... 

do i have hobbies? yes, but most of them don't involve interactions with people. i keep a big fish tank and i love them. i play video games too. i've been rescuing stray dogs since i moved here. i used to volunteer at my local shelter but since i adopted my dog here and got busy with school i volunteer much less nowadays...

"aitah for letting my coworkers quit because i got fired?. a regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar i worked at for over 10 years, i worked there for 4 years. i made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought i was taking one. i just want to make extra money.

my manager happened to see this on the cameras. there is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it's a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

there is no way to prove there wasn't booze in my shot, i saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove i didn't put liquor in that shot.

i honestly don't and didn't care enough to argue with her about it. i'm about to start a new job since i graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

i trained basically every new person at this bar, and i was honest with them that i was fired in our work group chat. they all started saying if you got fired for that we don't want to work here either. they were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

i told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. i said i'm going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink anything out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. i also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

i then let my anger overtake me and i said ""if you want to find a job where you don't have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. you're all capable people that don't deserve a psycho watching over you when you've put good time into a work place."" i basically contradicted myself. 

i feel like i went over the top, my sister said i should've kept my mouth shut. but i explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the ""mix things together to look like booze so people don't feel rejected when they buy you shots trick"". she thinks it's crazy the new manager won't trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

my old manager quit because she was moving away with her fiance, but she told the new manager that i was trustworthy and i thought the new manager would have some trust considering i was basically running the bar when she came in. 

whatever the case, aitah for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? because as of now 7/10 bartenders where i was fired from are planning a group quit. i don't want the bar to close, but i want my manager to realize that she messed up...",3
"for going to a nice restaurant with my wife and sharing a meal?. my wife and i are not from the us but we have lived here for the last 2 years. on a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. however since we are not used to american portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.

when we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. we will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. however occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.

last night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). when they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. we were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.

when we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. he asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious. after around 5 minutes we still didn't get the bill, but after close to 10 minutes either the owner or manager (don't know who he was) came up to us and gave us the bill and he said something like ""this is a ~~full~~ full service restaurant, you cannot just come in here and order an appetizer and leave"". he gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.

here? this seems so foreign to me. we still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group? it shouldn't matter that it is a full service restaurant, people have different appetites.

"for exploding on my father's wife. throwaway  

hear me out on this one.

in regards to ages, i'm 17, dad is 43, and father's wife 27 or 28.

six years ago, it came out during couple's therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. my mom initiated divorce. six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. my dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day i can truly forgive him.

i do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father's wife, i begrudgingly show respect. i have never called her out of her name until later in this story. if she speaks to me, i will say something back. if i am in her home, i will clean up after myself. however, i will always refer to her as my father's wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. this is something she cannot accept.

i have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. while at my father' house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying ""the blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,"" and said that i was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why i would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. i guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

she then revealed that when my dad gets back from his tdy (temporary duty assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say ""don't mess with her,"" with her 2-month-old daughter. i have never been in any of the previous family portraits because i refused to and my dad said i didn't have to.

i told her i was not going to participate

she asked why i was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

six years' worth of hurt came out. i told her she was a fool to ever think i was her child or that i considered her family. from my perspective, she was nothing, but my father's racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. i took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn't my father's child because she looks nothing like him.

she turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful i was and i had no right to talk to her in such a manner. i fully admit i called her a bitch and stated she didn't even deserve any respect from me because she didn't respect my mother's marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. after realizing what i had said, i left and haven't talked to her since.

everyone that i have talked to say i should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and i don't mind doing that.  however, certain people say i shouldn't have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

he and i had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, i guess). he told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""it's raining men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""highway to hell"" and ""another one bites the dust."" 

to remember him, i want to bring a speaker and play ""another one bites the dust"" at his wake. i would explain it to the people at the wake and say that i wanted to preserve the person he was. maybe i could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. there will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are catholic, so i've been thinking maybe not. but i really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. i think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

wibta?

edit: i didn't really expect this response, but thank you. my brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. i swear, i almost sense his hand in it. i don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

this morning, i talked to my dad about the wake. i suggested, as some of you did, that maybe i could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. i found a violin one that i really liked. my dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and i made. he actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. i hadn't really been thinking about my dad as much as i should have, i thought of him as opposition, i guess he cared way less about the catholic stuff than i thought. 

i also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. we are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

"if i record the audio of my neighbours having sex and play it back to them?. my neighbours are often super loud, blasting music at 2am, yelling, blaring the tv. i've gone round various times politely asking if they could be quieter. we have concrete walls and carpet, so for sound to get through they really have to be loud, which they are. they also periodically have loud sex, with the woman screeching. it's actually turning me off sex. i find them insufferable. 

 as petty revenge, i'm considering recording them having sex and playing it back to them through the walls whenever they're loud, instead of going round to politely request they stfu at 3am. i feel they know i'm mild-mannered, and they're taking advantage - that since i'm not a tough guy or something (i'm a young woman), they don't care.

"my college says if i miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes. (ia) i was sexually assaulted (while home over a break, not by another university student) and the trial of my attacker starts in two weeks. 

i am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and i'll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

i'd spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days i'd be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work i'd be missing. 

unfortunately, one of the days i'll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

his request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if i missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

my professors were comfortable marking these as ""reported absences"" which basically means there was a justification like a doctor's note or other official documentation. 

i showed the deans that i was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn't  even really like i had a choice. i figured that would be enough documentation. 

the dean said that ""personal non-medical conflicts"" could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if i'd just  slept through class). they suggested i apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise i'd be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

this attack took enough from me already, i went to great lengths to be sure i didn't miss a day of school while recovering, i do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

i spoke to the title ix office who'd promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence. 

i do not want to take a leave of absence. all my professors were ready and willing to work with me and i was/am entirely capable of keeping up with the work. 

do i have any legal recourse here against the school? 

thank you in advance. ",2
"so we decided to fuck with the sub.. # major update: 60 minute contest mode & extension of beta testing to august 14. 

**we have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. the beta test will be extended to august 14.** it has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. we ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. please see below for some comparative information!

**we noticed massive increases in time until top comment**

> before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> with the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (around 30-40% increase)

> with the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). this is an incredible increase and very rare for reddit as a whole. we're taking this as a win. (around 120-150% increase)

> unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. however, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to google).**

> we don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. however, we know it was much shorter. i think it was somewhere around half?

> this shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**more information to be seen! we will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# original thread info

hey all you assholes and judges. we recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. a huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. take a look here(https://m.imgur.com/a/vzvv1ag). 

we think that's a problem. a comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. we want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. so, we've decided to fuck with the sub. 

---

# introducing ~~30-minute~~ 60-minute contest mode

for the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **contest mode.** the comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. you will not be able to see the karma score of comments. after 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. the comment order will be ""best"" instead. 

**why did we do this?** the first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. by opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. no one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. we tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). it didn't work out well. a 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",3

"aita for giving a woman a taste of her own behavior. i'm sitting at the airport and this older lady sat down right next to me and took her ipad out and starts watching a show quite loud. 

to me this is a foul in public however i just ignored it and put my earbuds in. 

after a while i made a phone call using my earbuds. literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

i was as polite as i could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and i could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

she said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. 

i said she was absolutely right and i am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and i will do  the same.       i then proceeded to take out my ipad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds. 

i have never seen someone storm off so mad. 

quick edit. i turned the music video off almost immediately after she left. ",3

"for hiding my personal life at work?. i'm in a little trouble at work because i've been sort of hiding my personal life. i've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. i'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. with that, i never, ever talk about home life. i'm not ashamed of my life i just don't like to discuss it at work. my coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. if i'm asked any questions i usually redirect or move on to someone else. in this manner, none of my coworkers knew i'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

we hired melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. she spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. however, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. try as she did, i never gave her anything. my coworkers view me as a sort of enigma. compartmentalization aside, i've made some great friendships at work. there are more things to talk about than my husband and my kids. they are a big part of my life but i'm not even going to martyr myself and say they're the most important. they're hugely important and come before everything else but i'm not a sycophant and i enjoy the ten hours a day i'm at work when i get to be an adult and talk about things other than jojo siwa and the newest jenndashian exploit.

last week, friday, melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. at lunch she announced to everyone that i am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. i play softball, i kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that i'm on facebook. she couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. i use a shortened version of my name (ali from alexandra) and my married name on fb so i'm not sure how she found me, unless she used whitepages and put two and two together. i've already reported her to hr.

but the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a bfd. one of my friends said she's hurt that i don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". i tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, i just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. i never bring work home. when i'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. heck, i chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when i'm not there. i've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. i honestly don't see the problem. i've never lied to them, i've never given them false info, i've never made up wild tales about my life. i'm still the same person i was, now they just know more about me than they did.

eta: i know this has been posted three times today. i didn't know reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and i thought it was the account i was posting from so i created a second throwaway and then a third because i never got confirmation the post was uploaded. i couldn't even get past the white screen with the little reddit face spinning in the center. those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. this one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

eta:  i don't have any sort of interesting update. hr brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us wtf is going on. i presented my side, as detailed above, melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. i asked my hr rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. there were several. then i asked him to search my married name, or the one i go by on fb, ""ali smith"". there were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. in any case, too many to count. i haven't touched my own page since i reported the incident. it was about thirty names from the top but like i said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. i do have an instagram page that's on private but i only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. she found me night before last and friended me. naturally i blocked her. hr gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. my rep wasn't sure why melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called bs on her for claiming it was innocent. so that's that. that's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. however, i took the advice from this sub and i'm making amends. they're all most receptive. i'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. but they know enough about me to know i'm not an automaton or anything.",3
"by complimenting a co-worker on his weight loss. this happened just moments ago.

i have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  in my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions i rarely see him.  it has been about a year and a half since i have seen him and i was surprised to see him in my area today.  he has lost about a hundred pounds so i thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  i said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  he responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  we aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which i was completely expecting as i awkwardly stood in the hallway.  

when i got back into my office i brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  my office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.

"boyfriends ankle monitor is dying, his charger isn't working and no one from the house arrest company will pick up. what should we do??. trying to get this update out there proved to be harder than i thought. so i put my update here. 

op is still published at the bottom of this post

i know a lot of people were concerned about the reason behind my boyfriends house arrest sentence. which led to an entire post on r/bestoflegaladvice being dedicated to how gullible, stupid and naive i must be for believing his reasoning. whelp! he got off house arrest on tuesday (9/10) ((yay!! :)), i asked if he would mind if i uploaded his ""certificate of completion"" to reddit and he said that was fine.

certificate of completion (https://imgur.com/a/by974wg)

a few people asked some really good questions so i'm going to try to be as clear as possible:

he really was not on probation or parole. when he went to trial he was given the option to ""complete the program,"" which was a year with a privately owned house arrest company. if he failed to complete the program he would be sentenced to three years in prison.

the terms of his house arrest, as per the company's rules, where that he was allowed one grocery store trip a week and needed to provide sign-in and sign-out sheets for his daily work shifts. he could not leave the house otherwise unless explicitly approved by the owner of the company. every other week he was required to ""check in,"" which means he had to go into the house arrest place, sit down with someone, and provide receipts for his trips to the store as well as all of his work slips to prove that he was at the locations doing what he was supposed to be doing. he had to pay the company $60/week to be on house arrest with them (which was quite an expense but definitely better than prison). 

now that he has completed the program, he hands over his certificate to a judge to show that he served his time and he is now eligible to reapply for a drivers license (which was obviously revoked when he was ""sentenced"" due to dus charges).

he was never on parole. he was never on probation. this entire ordeal was due to being a ""habitual traffic offender."" a year of house arrest. for driving without insurance. he could not afford the insurance and was driving to get to work, to afford the insurance, he even switched up cars every time he drove. does any of that make what he did okay? absolutely not. but i did want to provide proof for those who were concerned that that is why he was put on house arrest and for no other reason.

tl;dr: my boyfriend was sentenced to a year on house arrest due to traffic violations, no other reason. he has completed the program and now we're going to the beach.

thank you for coming to my tedtalk i hope this cleared things up. sorry for the lengthy post.


certificate of completion (https://imgur.com/a/by974wg)


op:

title explains it all. what is our best course of action to prevent him from going to prison if his monitor dies before they open in the morning? i suggested maybe filming himself sitting at home for proof he didn't go anywhere. he thinks maybe he should call the police and go into the station so that he can be supervised, maybe put in a holding cell overnight so that he has witnesses that he didn't go anywhere. 

time is a factor. what do we do??

edit: thanks everyone for your feedback. he called, left a voicemail, sent a text, sent a video recording of the monitor and charger not working (he has been on house arrest for 11.5 months we definitely know what it looks like when it's supposed to be charging)((he gets off sep. 14! :)), his supervisor has an iphone so we even shared his location with them. everything we could think of.


at 12:29am we got this text back:
""sorry so late.. i have been traveling today and not near a computer or cell coverage. i looked it up and it should have showed you on charge but hasn't. either it's not connected or charger not working. still showing low battery. call the office at 9 and talk to greg about it. i'm sorry.""

crisis averted. sounds like we'll just stay put until the office opens and then we'll go in to get everything checked, and we'll be sharing his iphone location with them until then.

i would like to take a moment to address a few frequently asked questions:
1. we are in south carolina.
2. he is not on probation or parole. he has never in his life been convicted of a crime. he was actually put on house arrest because he acquired too many traffic violations (none of which were duis, which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous).
3. the house arrest company is a privately owned business. there is a man and wife who charge every person they keep on house arrest $60/week. capitalism ladies and gentlemen.

thanks again for everything and if anything changes i'll let y'all know.

final edit: we went in to the house arrest place today after they opened, they gave him a new monitor, a new charger, a back up charger still in the box, and even knocked 4 days off his sentence!!! horribly, horribly stressful event had a relatively happy ending. thank you everyone who took the time to read and reply.

editedit: people are getting pretty mean, this got way out of hand. i want to genuinely thank everyone who responded to this post with helpful information when we were in need of advice, and our issue has resolved since then. i may make a separate post with all of the interesting information and developments that came about as a result of this once i get some more organized/tangible information, but honestly it's late and hate mail takes a lot out of you. thanks again to everyone who was sincere and wanted to help.


absolutely, positively, nonnegotiable final edit: okay kids, it's been a long day. we laughed, we cried, we learned a lot about ourselves. but at the end of the day, after grilling him, background searching him, and even calling his mom, it has become abundantly and unquestionably clear that my bf's current house arrest sentence is 100% due to three dus (driving under suspension) arrests. he was pulled over driving without insurance, three times. irresponsible? oh absolutely, he's known from the beginning how i feel about it. but, he is not, nor has he ever been, 1)in prison 2)on parole or 3)on probation. the disconnect was the difference between arrested and convicted, that is where i was confused and as a result confused some of y'all. he had been arrested several times when he was in his teens (a very, very long time ago) and all of them were for dumb teen stuff like petty shoplifting, which he never went to prison for. was that stuff irresponsible? yes. illegal?? also yes. but a long long time ago and entirely unrelated to his current house arrest sentence? you betcha. we had a good laugh about how dumb he was as a teen, he remembered a lot and i learned a lot. to everyone saying i'm dumb for believing him about his current situation: you had me really questioning things for a minute there and i'm sorry to disappoint you but that's all there is to it. he will be getting off house arrest on september 10th, and to celebrate we're going to the beach. the end.",2
"for giving my ex wife a large amount of money i won despite the anger of my gf?. i recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. i won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. it makes me feel funny even typing it's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

my ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. she is an amazing woman and good to the bone. we divorced 6 years ago because i had an affair with my current partner. i was in a low place in my life and i fucked up. she was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that i know she was hurting. she still is close with my parents. she is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

she was actually the first person i phoned after my mom and pops after i found out i won the lottery. she was pleased for me, joked that i could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. nothing else. as soon as i won, i knew i wanted to give her a significant amount. i still love her. she's the mother of my babies and i feel like this is some small tiny way i can show her that i'm not a complete fuck up. she deserves to know that i care despite my mistakes. she also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. give our kids a better life between us. i haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but i have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

long story short, when i told my gf, she was my livid. screaming that i'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- i'm not *in* love with her. we've both grown apart, but of course i still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. my gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh i'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. i don't plan on changing my plans, but aita?

"why does everyone say not to pee in the shower?. i fully understand not peeing while taking a bath, but what is the big deal about peeing in the shower? i have never in my life heard a single legit reason other than the obvious ""pee is gross so don't do it"".

you are under a constant stream of water and there's already dirt, soap, whatever else you may need to scrub off going down the drain and human urine is less harmful to the environment than some of the things that get washed down the drain. and we all know that water doesn't get recycled through your tank. 

the only other reason i've ever been given is ""girls shouldn't because it just runs down their leg and that's gross, especially since they probably just shaved their leg so all those pores are opened up"" which, personally, my first response was `??????????????????` and my second was `no`.

i will fight to the end for my right to pee in the shower and this world isn't strong enough to stop me, i will show no mercy as my fluids release under warm euphoric streams of life-giving aqua.

but for real i am genuinely curious from an educational standpoint.

when she did pass away i was surprised she hadn't written down who got what pieces. since i had already passed on inheritance of a piece i didn't go to the meeting with the rest of the family. basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. from what i heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. 

since i wasn't there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. it was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. it was sweet of them to do that, so i could have a piece of her everyday too. 

when i got the ring i didn't examine it. it was big enough i thought it was fake too. but then i saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating leo diamonds). i took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. it's value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). essentially i got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. but they chose it for me. 

now, they want to redo the distribution. but i feel like it's fair. i didn't ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. if i refuse?

"giving my 17 yr old nephew advice on how to meet women.. a few weeks ago i flew out to fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since i havent seen them in 4 years. the first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. they gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. the conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. the older son ,""alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at hs and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. on the other hand is my nephew ""dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. when i pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and dan. being the cool uncle i let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. as she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my marine corps days. if he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. but dont go empty handed. i suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. now that i think of it i was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. so the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 a few days later it occured to all of us dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. when his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. i however was not buying it. i pulled him aside and got the truth. the boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. he would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. he met a girl and they had been seeing each other. i was happy i could help and could not believe it actually worked. however things went south. 
 a few days after my return to the east coast i received a very emotional call from my sister. she explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""have you seen this man"" flier on the door. it was a grainy surveillance photo of dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. the flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. when she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. now dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and i told i am not invited for christmas. poor dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

"several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community.... if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.

however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other

the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

next, the pope waved his finger around his head. the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

the rabbi pulled out an apple.

with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. the jews could stay in italy!

later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened. the pope said, 'first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs.' 'then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us.' 'finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'he bested me at every move and i could not continue!'

meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won. 'i don't have a clue!!!' the rabbi said. 'first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger.' then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here. 'and then what?' asked a woman. 'who knows...' said the rabbi. 'he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!'",0
"by burning 700 lbs of marijuana and getting half of the military high.. while overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. we usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. enough pot for a lifetime. the pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. sometimes taller. it's grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. it's a remarkable sight. 

for those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, i would like to clarify… i never touched the stuff overseas. far too terrifying. they also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there's another reason to steer clear.

anyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. well one day while searching a suspected hme (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. if you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. my mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. a literal fortune. this looked like the hulk fell into a wood chipper. 

a genius counterpart suggested that we bring mt. kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. 

""well that's a clever idea!"" i thought, relieved that we wouldn't have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. 

ah but ambushed, we were. the bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. i ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. 

&#x200b;

the early effects weren't bad. the smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, tower 3. jokes went around as we awaited the results. coughing could be heard immediately and the private in tower 3 called out to us: 

""hey we need to…. we need to… do something… like… now?"" i could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. 

this was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.

""sergeant, i'm… i'm high as shit!"" he yelled moments after. i panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. 

""someone, relieve him!"" (genius)

several individuals raced to take over tower 3. we devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. how perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. like a lazy pot-nado. around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently tower 2. several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. 

""who the hell approved this!!?"" the first sergeant yelled

""i believe you did.."" the co responded 

""well where's the detail that brought it in?"" 

""that would be us first-sergeant"" myself and a couple others. i thought back to the decision-making process and realized that i had a ton of responsibility in the matter. in fact, i was *really worried.* abnormally concerned… i felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking ""ohjesusohjesusohjesus i'm going to get caught...!"" it was in that moment that i realized, i was sketching. i was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. 

i turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. my leaders did not need to see me drool. i hazily walked back toward tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other's laps, goofing off, and having a 'deep philosophical conversation' about a bug's journey through life.

inert.

i wrote tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward tower 2 to see if i could help, a big stupid smile on my face. they seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. i started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. we theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the tower 2 crew.

i assume the wind was completely dead now, as i remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. **here**(https://imgur.com/a/lvzqg8f) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.

at this point i thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. here i was reunited with half my squad. instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and i could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. 

although i was personally quite effected, i think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. a lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. i did not personally see it. i came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where i belonged. i theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. no repercussions followed.

 

tl;dr – tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us.",4
"small breasts are infinitely better than huge fake breasts.. fake breasts look like they're...fake. they rarely look good. even the best jobs still look bad. most look like half volleyballs taped to the chest. they they maintain their shape when the woman lays on her back. they only look semi convincing when the woman is fully clothed. every time i see them in a porn it's a turn off too. bottom line, ladies, natural breasts, no matter their size and shape, are better and much sexier.

disclaimer, i realize women can do whatever they want with their body. nobody is telling you not to here so please don't lecture me about that shit. remember, this is just an opinion.

edit: i feel i need to put out a couple disclaimers here.
1. i realize, to some, this isn't ""unpopular"" but i felt it was enough so to make this post. there are enough women getting it done and not having it turn out the best.
2. yes, big naturals are good as well. my intent was to give an example of an extreme opposite to show preference.
3. i am perfectly aware women's breasts aren't made for my pleasure but there is something to be said about why augmentation is done for vanity...and yes i am also aware of there being other reasons a woman may have fake breasts other than vanity.

"(update) nebraska i just closed on a new house, sellers allege that i owe a portion of their 990$ security system cancellation fee because i did not take over their contract. threatening small claims court.. https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9h80ot/nebraska_i_just_closed_on_a_new_house_sellers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

thank you to all of the people who commented on the original thread. this was my first time dealing with small claims court and all of the helpful advice and information really helped set me up for success.


so, short story is that the sellers did end up taking me to court for roughly $1,400. this was for the total cost of the contract buy out for their security system, travel expenses since they moved out of state and would need to pay for gas and lodging to come back to sue us, as well as court costs. 


small claims court was surprisingly straight forward and informal. i've never been a big talker, but i honestly don't think i was able to say more than three words at a time without the plaintiff interrupting me. the judge eventually asked her to please stand in the hall way so i could speak my side fully. she absolutely refused to leave, but did stay quiet for a short minute so i could say that i never agreed to take over her security contract, and there was no documentation to suggest that i did.


the judge agreed and ended up ruling in my favor. i thought it was done there but the plaintiff swiftly appealed the decision. so now we had a new court date early this month with a different judge. 


during this time the plaintiff continues to send me hostile emails and voice messages. the seller's broker (their realtors boss) called me while i was at work to tell me he was very displeased i filed a formal complaint against his realtor. he told me i was not welcome to pursue any future business with his company, and i assured him the feeling was mutual. the broker said he supports all of his realtors and will not be acting on the complaint in any way. so i went and talked to the mayor's office about the situation. the mayor asked me what i wanted out of this, and i showed him the hostile emails from the seller and told him i felt it was the realtor's job to act as an in-between, even after the sell was complete. the mayor said he would step in and speak with the broker. (this is a fairly small town, they probably already knew each other). 


i never heard from the seller again after that, thanks mayor. so now it comes time for round 2 in small claims court. the new judge goes through and reads the write up from round 1 and asked the plaintiff if there is new evidence or information that has not been covered. long story short, there was not. the judge ended up sustaining the previous ruling in my favor, and strongly advised the plaintiff not to appeal unless there is new evidence or information that has not been seen by the court.


it's been five days and no word on an appeal so i think it's safe to say i'm finally done and ready to put this whole ugly thing behind me. once again thank you to all of you who helped me on the original thread. i'm very pleased that resources like this community exist.


on a final note, gossip, but i got a call from the mayor at 2am the night before last because there was a house fire down the street from me. (the mayor and i know each other well). so i went to go help the volunteer fire brigade put it out. we got it under control and we were winding down when a deputy from the sheriff's office comes to tell me that the lady who sued me waited around the court building the day of the appeal for the judge to get off, then tried to confront him about the ruling in the courthouse parking lot. i didn't really care to hear about it, but it sounds like she's in some pretty deep shit now. kind of cathartic.


tl;dr: they lost and i think it's finally over.

edit: thank you for all of the very kind and thoughtful messages! to clarify some common questions, the ruling stipulated that the plaintiff pays all court costs, including my own. yes, i could probably countersue, but i'm very interested in dealing with the seller and broker as little as possible for the rest of my life. :)

in russia, there is a law which allow roskomnadzor, russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. two years ago i tested how rkn react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. on of that websites was reddit.

one thing i learned is that rkn doesn't want to block popular websites. they respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. it was on 05/21/2013(https://img.bi/#/vn0xdfz!sufwaazuq0ogfp6njqpmgqpwensqfa4kln1gdqhz). on 10st aug 2015 they posted a call to help them contact reddit administration(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official vk page. funny thing, but they called psilocybe a plant. several hours ago they reported that reddit is blocked in russia(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). seems like things changed.

how reddit is blocked? fully. as reddit switched to https, there is no way to block special page.

will i remove this post? no. i also think that reddit administration needs to do nothing. this is important issue on freedom of speech, and only rkn want to violate it.

btw, this post is a guide for indoor growing psilocybe mushrooms in russian. i'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to rkn.

"it has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34f) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. i (35m) am seriously considering a divorce.. happy update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy\_update\_it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy_update_it_has_been_7_months_since_we/)  


title may seem harsh so i apologize. also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

bit of background info about my wife: she's an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. so to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

to make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. for the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch netflix in bed. i brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least i could do.

but now it's 7 months later and she's still crying and watching netflix in bed all day. i ask her every day if she needs anything but all i get in response is variations on either ""leave me alone"" or ""some peace and quiet"". virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. i do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. i've suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. therapy. she said that all therapists spew bs back at you.
2. adoption or using a surrogate. she shot down both saying that it just didn't feel right to her.
3. moving to her parents' city. she said moving 100 miles was too much stress.
4. buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). she snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child.
5. taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. again, she said that's too much stress.

earlier tonight i had a talk with my wife. i told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. she said that she's fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help.

don't get me wrong, i love my wife with all my heart. i'm doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. i know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly i cannot bear living like this for much longer. what do (or can) i do?",8

"for not punishing my son after he came up with a pretty elaborate plan to ""peep"" on the neighbor girl topless in her back yard?. lots and lots of ugly background here but i'll try not to wander. my wife i have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in may. i have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. 

on monday i came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. i asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. they said they were playing army and since i've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, i knew their parents wouldn't mind either. so i told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case i needed him to come down. i was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. so they did this every day this week until thursday when my daughter came home from her cit job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if i was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. i climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where i assume the girl had usually sat. i told my son to knock it off and he said he would. 

this morning i got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would ""confront"" me and my son saturday morning. we sat down and it went from a calm ""this is something we're concerned about"" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an ""adolescent sex ring"" in a matter of seconds. i tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and i've gotten them to stop. my wife asked if i planned on punishing him, i said that i don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. my neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. i told her that was really overkill. my wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and i asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. my wife has texted me that i am being incredibly irresponsible and if i don't do ""something"" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement. in all of that she called me an asshole several times and said it was more miserable being divorced from me than it was to be married to me. yay weekend! 

i guess that's about it...but am i the asshole for how i'm handling the issue with my son?",3

my wife and i (m42) have been married for 2 years together for 15.

all this time we had either not decided to have kids or had problems getting pregnant. after some medical testing we found out that it was near impossible to get pregnant due to some medical issues with her.

we were thinking of adopting when one day she came home and told me she was expecting. ofcourse i was super happy . 

a week later we had an appointment at the gyno and she had some blood drawn. the test came back negative and ofcourse i was devastated but she wasn't. she claimed that she was pregnant and that the doctor was wrong. we took some more store-bought ones and they all came back negative. my wife is in complete denial. now she claims we are having twins. she is buying them clothes and decorations and is pressuring me to start with the nursery.

i am at a loss and don't know what to do. my inaction is making her believe that i want to leave them and that i am going to doom my wife into the life of a single mom.

what the f is even happening. i love her but i don't know what to do.

"by dating my cousin for 5 months. you hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing 

i was talking to this guy on hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, i thought he was the one. after exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. we dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn't had time to meet each other's parents. instead of doing the traditional, i'll bring you over to meet my parents, and i'll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. you can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend's mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(uncle's daughter). it took her a second to realize as well. since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn't seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and i moved to the same city. we could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn't right to do. that was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. i told my friends that it didn't work out and silently removed everything from social media..

last monday i went to collect my refill of my medication, they weren't able to fully fill the full balance so instead provided me with a weeks worth of my medication, and told me to collect the balance on the following day.

on wednesday evening i went in to collect my balance, only for the pharmacy technician to tell me she could not find my prescription. after taking my information she told me that i had already collected my remaining balance tuesday afternoon. i denied me ever doing this, and was told she could not help me and i would need to come in thursday morning to talk to head pharmacist to explain the situation.

thursday morning i went and talked to the head pharmacist who:

* insisted that i already collected my remaining balance. which i denied repeatedly.
* i told her to confirm via their security cameras that it was not me collecting the medication, which she did. 
* now repeatedly insisted that i allowed someone else to collect my remaining balance. i told her i have no one allowed to do that on my file, except my parents. who neither of them is alive anymore. 
* unfortunately she told me she could not help me further, and i need to report my medication as stolen. which i refused to do, because i never received my balance, and i felt that would be me admitting fault on my part.
* i called my doctor and explained my situation, and he immediately called the pharmacy. the head pharmacy tech told him that they dispensed my prescription to me. he told me unfortunately he cannot re-issue me my prescription, unless the pharmacy admits wrong doing. 
* the head pharmacist basically told me she could do nothing for me, and asked me to leave or security would be called.

i went home and called the corporate number of the pharmacy, and explained everything to them. they agreed to open an investigation however told me this could take well over a month to get a result, they gave me a case number, and recommended that i make alternative arrangements with my doctor. 

on friday i called my doctor again, and explained everything one more time, he was sympathetic however he told me he cannot re-issue my prescription unless the pharmacy admits they screwed up because it is a controlled substance. 

can anyone help me? or tell me what the hell i should be doing here?",2
"i'm a bitch to my husband when he wakes me up. my husband and i have been married for 5 years. we have three boys, ages 4, 2, and 6 months. it's no secret that i am cranky when i am tired, and especially when i'm awakened from sleeping. we joke about it a lot, but this morning he was really upset with me...

last night, i went to bed at 10. he stayed up, which was fine. he even took the baby downstairs with him so i could get some better quality rest. all good. 

just after midnight, he came to bed with the baby. (baby sleeps in our room.) i don't remember any of this, but he says he put the baby down and went to brush his teeth. baby started crying. i got out of bed, flung open the bathroom door, said ""get this baby out of here, you woke me up!"" and went back to sleep. 

this morning i woke up at 630 when our second son woke up. i noticed my husband was not in bed, and our baby was not in the room, either. feeling very well rested, i told my husband i felt great, and asked if he slept downstairs. he said yes. i asked why, and he told me i yelled at him and he didn't want to deal with it. 

i remembered none of this. once he told me the details, i have a vague recollection of what happened. 

i feel really guilty about this.  simply telling myself to be more conscientious doesn't seem to be working. how do i change this behavior?

edit: thank you all so much for all the posts and advice. when hubby got home, i gave him a big hug and told him i was really sorry.  i told him i really wanted to work on it, and read the list of ideas that you guys helped me generate; thank you so much. we had dinner, i put the older two to bed; he took the baby. after the boys were down, i planned to continue the convo (and see where the one-on-one time leads us), but he is sound asleep with the baby!  i'm going to let him get that much-needed rest. will do some research online and see what kind of help there is available for me. thanks again.",8
"aita: for not wanting to hide my period from my step-brothers like my step-mum wants me too?. i (f20) recently had to move back in with my dad, step-mum and 2 of my step-brothers (15 and 17). 

the last time i lived here was 2-3 years ago. back then i remember getting very pissed off when my step-mum asked me to stop using the bin in the toilet to put my waste sanitary products and use the one in my room (on the other side of the house) because she didn't want her boys to see it. 

now it's not like i was leaving used tampons and pads out in the open, everything was and still is, wrapped up so no blood is on show. 

anyway i never stopped using the toilet bin. 

now i'm back she's started a new thing. moving my small zip up bag full of my sanity products, that i keep next to the toilet, and slightly open (for easy access), when i'm on my period, to under the sink zipped up. 

i personally think i absolutely should not be hiding the fact i have a vagina and it bleeds. her boys will grow up thinking it's gross and something that needs to be hidden. i would just feel sorry for the girls they end up with. and i just want to be comfortable in the house i'm living in.

edit: for more info, this isn't a random house i've moved back into. i've lived here since i was 3 before my parents got divorced when i was 7. my step mum and her kids moved in when i was 12(ish). i moved out at 17-18 for multiple reasons. 

so this is just as much my house as it is hers, arguably more.",3

"for not helping an obese woman get up after she refused my help the first time?. i was at a coffee shop and a woman came in with a scooter. at a certain point she went to the restroom, she left the scooter parked outside, went in, and on the way out, as she was trying to get back on the scooter she fell down, pretty bad. 

as i was near, i rushed to see if everything was ok or to see if something serious happened, cause it was a super loud noise.

when she saw me coming near her she said "" don't touch me i'm fine "", in a really agressive angry voice. 

i said ok, i just wanted to see if she needed any help, and she replied "" i dont need your help"", again super angry. 

i wasn't the only one that got up and got closer to her, but i was the first one, cause i was sitting right by the restroom

cool, went back to my table, and saw her struggling to get up. then one of the baristas came, and asked if she could help, the woman tried to get up again and failed, so she let the barista help her. 

she couldn't help her alone, as the woman was quite big. so another person went to help, a costumer, but they were still struggling to lift her up.

the barista, which was not present when she refused my help, turned  to me and asked if i could help and i said "" i was trying to, but she told me to back off, so yeah, i'm good"".

i kept sitting down then another costumer came then another working person and then they finally got her up and back on the scooter.

they all gave me dirty looks and everything went back to normal

am i the asshole for refusing to help her after she was extremely rude and refused my help at first?

"my parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. i am sick of this shit (florida). for clarity we're both minors. i'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. she has never been right since we were little kids. always violent. she bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when i was 5 because i wouldn't let her ride my bike. all of my life i've been putting up with this shit and i have had enough.

she hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. my parents wont do anything about it. she's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. i really don't know what is wrong with her. she's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. my parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. they refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". which brings us to today. my parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. whatever, not important.

anyway, i was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. we decided to go to the dollar tree to get some snacks. demon didn't buy anything. as we left the store i could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. i confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! i don't know why. don't they make meth out of those or something? so i told her i was going to call mom. i pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! i was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was i going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. i took her down and had her pinned on the ground. that's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will not stop otherwise. i had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. she got me in the throat and i was letting her go! i was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

it took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. it hurts like a bitch. my friend gave me a bunch of tylenol and it still hurts. i came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *i* do to upset her?! i was so angry i told them i was calling the cops and my dad told me i couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! is that true??? 

something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and i'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  please help me. 

update: well shit went down basically how i expected it would. my mom called me very upset that police had came. what happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. i asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her baker acted because i was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and i guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. my mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. she said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved.

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men. it's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. but every woman i have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. and a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

and if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. if men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. but most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. its ludicrous.

tl;dr: women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. this is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. sorry this was so long.

edit: okay obviously i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so i would like to clarify some things. 

1. this thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. i have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. people who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. i am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. but there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. people refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, i think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have a lot to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. it starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",6

"police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him. this happened last week, he's only 11. at around 10am my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

they then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. the biggest issue is no one called us. not the school, not the police no one. we got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1pm).

we called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. we start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iphone and seen where he was and we headed there.

we got there at maybe 1:15pm and were completely stonewalled. no one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. he spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing nerf guns (this is important later).

we continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. she wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30pm and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7pm. they did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

we get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. they never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""creepers"" from their minecraft game. they painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

when they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. we've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

they kept offering him mcdonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. they asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. they kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

the school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. we can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. what the hell do we do?

"for dropping the ""we're not having kids, now stop bringing it up"" bomb on my mil?.  my husband and i don't want kids. my mil is big into family in the traditional sense. she has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

my husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. every time we see her, she asks. everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""we might not even have kids"" and mil would *not*hear it. at year 4, husband had a vasectomy and i had a tubal.

so this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some bbq and drinks and everything. when i get up to grab a beer, my mil asks me if maybe i should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

i was annoyed by this and said ""there's really no chance.""

mil, all wide-grin, said, ""oh come on! it's time for you two to finally get serious! put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

i said ""we've been official for about 5 years now, mil,"" and drink the beer. husband laughs with me.

mil gets more annoyed and says ""well, you won't be real (lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

husband said, ""mom, enough."" mil pushed again. husband repeated.

after about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, i finally snapped and said ""mil, husband got snipped. i had my tubes tied. we're not having kids. you need to stop bringing it up. period.""

well, i thought i started wwiii. she started crying and stormed off. family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. we left. party kinda ended. the social media bullshit started shortly after. vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. some meme about how ""i guess i wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" it's obnoxious to the point that i just muted all of them.

my mil finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if husband and i came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. i told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""well then, i guess you two aren't prepared to be real (lastname)s. i'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (it wasn't that much. it was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

"by laughing at my son while he was saying his prayers. so, my 6 year old often likes to make up his own prayers at night time and it's adorable.

"by not closing the tab of porn on my phone after masturbating.. here we go. this happened yesterday in university. 

so, i wake up at 7 and i have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.

i brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. as i am drying myself i pick up the phone to check time and it's only 7:20 yet and i have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and i haven't had a good release since a week. 

i take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching pornhub. i take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. i am all into it and realise i have only 5 more minutes left. i give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. 

i reach university and the examination hall is already full. here (india) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your exam registration. i take my stuff and enter the classroom. 

the invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. i go to my desk and as i am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. i lose my shit and get all tensed up. 

i try to keep calm and switch it to silent mode and tell myself if i act normally i won't get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. 

soon after the unfair means squad (they check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. i keep my head down and act like i have nothing. 

one of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. i start sweating and i almost shit my pants. she tells me to empty my pockets and i take everything out and put it on the desk.

 she stares at me and picks up my phone. 

""you seem like a studious one. why are you cheating?"" she said. 

""i am not. it's an honest mistake."" 

then she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if i have any pdf or browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she'll let me go. 

my heart finally stops powering a jet and i place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. 

my heart now starts powering a rocket as i recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. the video paused.  there's nothing on the screen though. no image or thumbnail. 

""cheating from a video?"" she says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. 

there it is. dani daniels and manuel ferrara going at it. the sound of dani daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. 

the professor dropped my phone and had a face as if i was masturbating in front of her. 

now i have failed computational mathematics and have to give a written apology to the dean of academics and convenor of examination. 

anyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. had to send the link. 


tl;dr : i forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn't allowed and thr professor caught me. she checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.

edit : 

1. for the people who think this is fake. it is not.   
                                                         
2.  for people who are saying why was i failed and now need to produce an apology one even though i wasn't cheating - it is because in india these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. also, i only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. 

3. the porn was manuel ferrara and dani daniels, they don't have much together. you will easily get it with one search on pornhub. if i may suggest something much more better, please try manuel ferrara and the goddess remy lacroix. the video starts with them talking about cup or something. that also is easily available. 

4. about the girl who asked for the link. 

i was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. 

the girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. as she came outside she asked me why did i bring a phone to the exam and even if i did, i could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. i said i could have but my i couldn't think at that time and was afraid. 

after that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. the girl accompanied me to the admin office. i accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. 

it was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. she asked to show me what was the video while giggling and i thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. she started laughing and told me i am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. she remembered my name and my department. then we parted ways. 

for fuck's sake, she is cute. stop telling me to pursue her. i have another exam later. maybe will meet her there. 


the indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.

"by letting my nephew use my deceased brother cell phone. this happened yesterday. my brother passed away in an accident a few months ago, he was only 35. needless to say, it was - and still is - a huge trauma to all of us. my 6 years old nephew wanted to play a game in my brother´s (his father) phone, sister-in-law was ok with it, so i let him. all of the sudden, i hear him doing a monologue... went to check up on him. he was clicking on family member´s pictures and making calls. a few moments later, people started to message me saying they almost had a heart attack. some didn´t have the balls to answer... my sister had to leave a work meeting because she started to shake. they were scared. they were surprised. the best was people´s description of the moment they picked up the phone and saw my brother´s name on the screen, thinking he was calling from the beyond. we all had a good laugh.

thank you for the gold.


thank you for the condolences.

"by missing my own graduation. i was supposed to graduate with my masters degree and had invited my whole family to attend my graduation. the only problem was that i told them all that my graduation was on sunday because i actually thought it was on sunday. people booked tickets, and cousins were coming from all over america. 

this morning i wake up at 11:30 and was casually seeing my instagram stories to see everyone in robes. my official school account also was posting about people graduating today. so i went back to the email they sent a few weeks ago on the graduation dates -- turns out i missed graduation. i'm still lying in bed calculating the magnitude of my stupidity. i don't even know what i'm going to tell everyone in my family who's going to come down to ""see me walk"". i missed my own graduation!! 

tl;dr: thought i was graduating on sunday but the graduation was today.

edit: just found out there is also individual department ceremonies at the university of florida. i missed the university-wide ceremony but i can still go to the engineering department ceremony on monday!!!

"someone threatened to kill me at the gym. i live in brooklyn.

i was going to the gym and returned what looked like a forgotten phone to the desk.

the man came looking for his phone and i told him i brought it to the front desk.

he became extremely agitated and demanded me to go get it.

when i said no, he became more enraged and threatened to beat me up.

he threatened to kill me several times.

he broke my headphones and when i approached the front desk for help he snapped my phone in half.

he threatened me several times and said he would kill me/snap my neck like the phone.

no one at the gym batted an eye, said anything or helped.

he never punched me, because i reminded him of the cameras and the police, but he was extremely imposing and like i said did threaten to assault me several times per minute.

&#x200b;

my question is should i go to the cops?

i just don't know if the brooklyn police will do anything and i am worried that he or his friends would actually assault me should i go to the police. 

i am also worried that the front desk might give away my information to him since he is a long time member. i think they only have my credit card info, but still.

i have what i believe to be his first name.",2
"children don't owe their parents anything for being raised by them.. a lot of people i've talked to think, that they are owed by their children for raising them. most folks don't even raise their children well, yet they expect the children to pay them back for all the trouble they had with them(?!). for pity's sake it was your choice to have children! if you consider that choice as an investment into your future, just don't have children because you are obviously a trashbag of a person for thinking that way. and even if the child was an ""accident"", it's not their goddamn mistake, it's yours! there is a ton of things you can do to prevent it. even an abortion is a 100 times better solution than raising someone just to make them feel miserable.",6
"my (19f) boyfriend (20m) broke up with me because i'm too good at sex. we've been dating for a year and he's a year older than me and we met in college. we took things slow bc we're both virgins and it's special to both of us so we agreed we'd wait until we're really in love and sure about each other. and after a year, we could see ourselves married in the future so we decided to have sex. 

even after our first time, he asked me if i really was a virgin or if i lied because i was too good. no i didn't lie. i just watched some educational videos and practiced on my own. since then, he'd get weird during sex. like if i did something good, he'd say it felt good and then his face would change like he was thinking. now i know he was questioning if i really was a virgin. 

anyway. he broke up with me yesterday after we had sex. tmi i was riding him and he said i act like a porn star and he's obviously not the only guy i've been with and he thinks i lied to him. i told him i watched a ton of porn and copy from the videos but he doesn't believe me. 

great. never thought i'd be dumped for being too good at sex. it just really sucks bc we had sex bc we thought we'd be long term and we broke up already. i want him back. i know he's just being paranoid. how do i tell him that i wasn't lying?

"girlfriend was arrested w/ a dui but blew a .06!!! cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!. so..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. she didn't drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. when the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). on her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. a minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. she admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

this is when it gets interesting. 

the officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. he then declared that she was drunk without having her blow to test her bac, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

then, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! that's below the legal limit (we are in wyoming). and the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her bac was. 

my question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? we have no money and probably can't afford a good lawyer. i could barely afford her bail. she is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn't deter her from pursuing her dream. 

any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. we have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn't tell her the miranda rights (found out he doesn't need to)


edit: thank you all so much for the help

edit: i am against drunk and unsafe driving (and so is my gf). in this situation she believed that she was good to drive and would not harm anyone. it was a shitty situation all around and she wishes that she had just walked or taken an uber.

"for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising?. so my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she's heard good things about. we get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, i'm hungry. 

i look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients i've never heard of. i order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki i think ($18). very important, these were listed as entrees on the menu. mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

so anyway we order as we are starving. my steak arrives and i am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. i joke to the waiter ""where's the rest of my steak?"" and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. i don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. when i go to restaurants i expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

i'm complaining to my girlfriend and she's getting annoyed with me. similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. granted the food was pretty good but i can not get over how tiny these portions are. i'm a big guy and i like to eat, what can i say. 

when the waiter comes back i inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. my girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, i don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

a manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. i don't end up paying as they realized i called them out on their bullshit. my girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. im still hungry so i drive through mcdonald's and get a burger, and when i did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. it's now the next day and i'm starting to think i didn't handle the situation as well as i could have (i could have probably just asked for a discount). my girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now i'm starting to think i'm an asshole.

am i the asshole?",3

"update i (29m) showed up to my gf's (25f) house and found her hanging out with a guy from class at 2am.. update to original post here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cw3cuz/i_29m_showed_up_to_my_gfs_25f_house_and_found_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

this all happening a couple days before what would have been our anniversary. i obviously should have seen the signs from the first post but the first part of this update is letting you guys know that i initially did not end the relationship. (what a regret).

how i handled it was we met the next morning to talk and i let her explain her side of things. she explained that other people were at the house that night earlier and she was going to be hanging around with kids from class sometimes now that school has started. keep in mind, she is 25 and going back to school now, and most these kids are around 19-22. nothing super serious as far as class load is concerned, she is studying theater at a community college. i explain to her why all signs point to that being a major red flag, she somewhat hears me out and apologizes for not better communicating her plans that night, but defends herself that hanging out with friends from class is not wrong. so in the future she would be communicate better about her plans and do a better job not making me feel concerned.

i was obviously angry and upset about the previous situation but i did truly love this girl and was willing to give things a chance to progress forward and her show me the positives changes.

we had continued our relationship and everything was going good for the most part. then recently communication did not seem to be going the best and there were some signs that she wasn't giving as much effort into the things we spoke about before as she had promised to do. there were signs of her actively trying to pick fights, and perpetuating them longer than needed even when i had made attempts to reconcile and move forward from any arguments. i did feel heavily at this time that she was not respecting me in these conversations, and any attempts i made to lovingly let her know this...met with hostility. which she then would attempt to turn right back on me, like it was my fault the fight even happened. this was getting old but i was still making every effort to bring us back to a good space on a more every day basis because i was wildly in love with this girl and the connection i thought we shared. the deceiving thing as well is that she was also very good at making me feel at other times she felt the same way about me, 'you're the love of my life, i love you more than anything, future plans together, talking about how lucky she was to be with me' etc. these were all exploited to be absolute lies.

fast forward to a few nights ago. we had plans to hang out that night and when i asked her earlier in the day what she wanted to do, she told me she had actually agreed to go get sushi with a friend she hadn't seen in awhile. i let her know this upset me since she was bailing on our plans, but in attempts to be understanding i then suggested we just meet up after instead and go out that night to do something fun. she did not give me a definite answer but kept bouncing around the subject saying she would keep me updated on when she was finished. i let her know, 'hey you don't cancel plans with your bf, then when hes cool about it and tries to suggest something else... leave him up in the air saying maybe we can hang' it makes me feel like not a priority and isn't how you treat someone you love. she ends up going off on me again and we leave on the terms of ok we will just talk later. i call later and let her know that after dinner it would mean a lot if we could spend some quality time together, i had been wanting that since all the time we were hanging out was during the day with other stuff going on sometimes.

she calls me after dinner around 930pm and lets me know she is home. i ask her to comer hang out so we can figure out what to do, and she deflects with ""oh my other friend (girl who i know) wanted to go to a midnight showing of a movie tonight and i haven't seen her in so long"".... i know i may seem completely stupid to you guys at this point but i assure you i was already seeing through her bullshit and knew something wasn't right. i keep calm and just let her know i think that was messed up, bums me out, and that i wish she would at least try to include me with her friends when doing stuff like that. she then takes to the level of trying to make me feel bad that i cant just be understanding she maybe wants to hang out with her friends without me sometimes. she tells me she will call me after the movie and asks if she can come over and spend the night with me after its finished...

meanwhile, i knew i had friends going out that night as well and i could go grab some drinks with them, finish up around same time and then meet back at my house to spend the night together. i did not tell her i was going out because it did not seem relevant at the time, and i had some weird suspicions that something else was going on.

1:45 am rolls around and im leaving the bar with some friends to grab a burrito before heading home. i walk down the street and lo and behold there she is on the corner of the street standing with a guy. one of the same guys from that night at the house in my original post. shocker, i know. i confront her and ask her whats going on, she attempts to even further lie, explain how her gf was suppose to come to (like that makes it any better lol) it isnt what it looks like, blah blah blah same old bullshit lies and no accountability even when caught in a dead lie on a date with another guy. i turn to the guy and ask him whats going on, he explains he invited to the movies, not much else, looks kind of scared because i'm sure i was irate. i have no problem with him at all because its 100% my then gf's fault. i walk to the side with her and ask her to just be real with me for once, tell me whats going, and come to terms with who she is and what shes done here. she shuts down when she realizes she cant talk her way out of things, and tries to ask if we can talk tomorrow and not make a scene here. i tell her if you want to explain yourself then you can leave right now and i will at least hear you out. she says no im not leaving my friend here alone you are overreacting and its not as bad as it looks. even though i'm pretty hurt at this point i cant help but to bust out in laughter at the disbelief of the whole thing now. i tell her this is it and this relationship is fully done now then. should have been done awhile ago, but that seals the deal and i truly see you for who you are now, a lying manipulative actual sociopath. i left with my friends, blocked her on everything and am now moving forward for good.

i do want to say though, i made a huge mistake in this whole scenario by not leaving when my gut told me to. so many signs pointed to her being so fake, such a liar, and not trust worthy at all... but i let the good times and her manipulative words keep me around thinking that i just needed to make more effort myself to make things work. and it wasn't until i had fully given all of myself into trying, that i was hit with the most disrespectful thing i have ever had done to me. listen to your gut people, and follow you intuition. if you are making clear efforts in a relationship with someone and they are giving you nothing back, creating friction, and show no remorse in any of their mistakes... run for the hills.

even though i was very hurt by the deceit and catching someone cheat on me, i ultimately know this is 100% for the best and a huge blessing in disguise because this person never truly loved me the way i cared for them. who knows how much longer i would have stuck around and let myself be treated like this, but i am grateful it happened now and there is no chance in hell i would ever give her a second of my time again. sorry for the novel, it feels good to vent. much love.

&#x200b;

tldr; attempted to work on things with my gf, gave serious effort and understanding to her. felt i was being treated very poorly in regards to that and got suspicious of her actions. caught her on a date with another guy. broke up with her on the spot, blocked her on everything, moving on.

edit: i really appreciate all the positive response  and feedback i've gotten here. as well as all the insightful messages i've received. i am doing my best to respond to everyone who has taken the time to give me their input, positive or negative. thank you

edit 2: for the people responding thinking i was making assumptions about the situation i walked up on that night, and defending that it could have been just a friend. let me explain that there was no way it was not what it looked like. i did not include the whole dialogue exchange between us, but the guy did make it clear he was under the impression they were on a date. which is when i walked away because it definitely contradicted her whole made up story.",8

"by telling my best friend i love her when i thought i was going to die. throwaway because i don't want this to be on my main account:


obbligatory ""this didn't happen today but happened last week yadda yadda yadda""

also please forgive my spelling mistakes because i'm in the hospital and writing this on mobile out of boredom of there being not much to do here.

so, last week i was driving casually on the country road close to my house on holiday back home for the summer after my second year of college. i wasn't paying too much attention (i assume some responsibility) and wasn't wearing a seat belt. yes i'm an idiot i know lesson learned. wear your seat belts kids! anyway, it was just starting to rain and i saw a kid about to go into the road. for the life of me i still don't know why he thought it would he a good idea to go onto a quite highly trafficked country road so casually, but eh life is full of surprises. i was caught completely off guard and swerved into the opposing lane to avoid him, and promptly got hit head on by the car coming towards me.

now, i was going quite fast and as i said, did not have a seat belt on. next thing i knew i was out of my car and couldn't feel anything anymore. no pain, no panic, nothing. i just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush i've ever had in my life. i just laid there, not knowing what to do. i heard voices come towards me but didn't really know what they were saying, and couldn't really respond. i thought i was going to die. there was a lot of blood.

you know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die? well that didn't quite happen but i did start thinking about who i care about and who i love. here's where i tell you about my best friend. a girl i've been in love with for around two years, i never let her know and never intended too. she is in a happy relationship she's had since her teens and i didn't want to ruin it, and if she's happy i'm happy. there's no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren't meant to be. but i thought i was literally dying, and all i could think about was her in those moments. the pain was starting to kick in but i was just thinking about how she'd never know how much i loved her.

i realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force i could muster i took it out. it was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message i could sent was an ""i love you"" to her. i thought that would be the last message i'd ever send.

i don't remember much after that. days have been a blur. i've had quite a few operations, aki due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. but my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like i got in a fight with a lion but it's slowly improving! all i do is sleep and appreciate the fact i'm alive. the other driver and the kid were okay btw.
anyway, as you can see, i did indeed live and didn't die (so far), but i can't undo that message i sent. i've been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven't had the energy to confront the situation. i told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. i haven't replied yet and i don't want to. i don't know what to do. so far i've been writing this as procrastination and then after this i plan on taking a long nap. thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.



tldr: got in a car accident and while i was bleeding out i told my crush best friend i love her. she's in a 10 year relationship and i haven't talked to her about it since and it's destroying me.



edit: god guys this blew up so much!!! i only wrote this to procrastinate the inevitable conversation you guys are amazing jeez thanks for all the advice and support!!

so i spoke to her... over the phone because we're college friends and she lives far away right now. i decided that the best thing i could do at this point was just tell her the truth. i didn't expect anything and i didn't want anything to come out of it, but i just thought that to have a pure and true friendship everything needs to be out there or it just wouldn't be legitimate. i would love to tell you guys an amazing fairytail story that would give you guys all hope for the future and whatnot, but i guess life is just different from movies...

i told her how i felt in pretty much the same words as in this post. but i also added, and it's true, that i've gotten to know her boyfriend for the past few years and he's great. i don't want to hurt him or interfere as much as i want her happy. i think she understood where i came from and the circumstances in which those words were said. i hope nothing will change with her because i love spending time with her and neither of us can immagine life without eachother anymore, we both admitted that. so i guess i just have to give you the boring response... but it's reality so sorry if it sucks... im okay with though, i really didn't expect anything and still kind of think i was being selfish. we talked about a lot of other things like we normally do for a couple of hours after that and she might be coming to visit me in the hospital this weekend! she said she'll try and make the trip, even though i told her not to because it's gonna be extremely expensive for her last minute... she was really flattered though i think and almost cried thinking she was the last thing i thought about when i thought i was going to die",4
"by trying to remember what a customer looked like. the time has come. i've made it. i'm writing this from the break room shaking and humiliated. not only did this fu happen today, it happened within the last hour. i don't see my therapist again until friday, so you get to hear about it instead.

i work in a customer-facing position in a small office. today's just a regular monday. talking to customers, preparing their work orders, finishing their paperwork, all sorts of small stuff. at time being, i have three customers sitting in my waiting area.

the most recent addition to our quiet morning waiting room, we'll call her jan, has been here before. or rather, her family has a customer history with us - it's my first time meeting her. the name on their account is hank junts and i feel like i've met him before. i *know* that i've met him before. i browse through their history and they have extensive records, but for the life of me i cannot place his face.

after about ten minutes of idle clicking, i decide to search his name on google with the name of our city.

>""beloved softball coach hank junts passes away in tragic fire."" 

headline from a local news station.

*oh my god. maybe that's why i've never met her before. maybe he always came in instead of her.*

the article is dated december of last year.

*jeeze, it probably has been that long since i've seen him, hasn't it. oh how tragic.* jan is probably only in her 40s or so. 

i wonder if i should say anything.

but i don't have to say anything. i would credit satan with the creation of auto-play videos on news articles, but satan never did anything so heinous.

**in tragic news, hank junts, softball coach at smith middle school, passed away as a result of a house fire last night.**

at full volume - echoing through the small room like a bird that got trapped inside, bouncing and flitting around uncatchable. i cannot catch it. the bird has knocked a vase onto mrs. junts' head. the bird has knocked me on my ass. there is a bird in my throat and it feels like my mouth is full of feathers.

*oh my god oh my god oh my god.*

**no no no.**

i frantically scroll trying to find the video player. fuck. found it. pause pause pause pause pause you piece of shit.

*oh yeah, that's what he looks like.*

jan looks up at me. i look up at jan. the earth crackles and groans as the floor beneath me opens and swallows me whole.

no, i'm not that lucky. i stammer something about being so sorry for her loss and run to the break room, where i now sit red-faced and horrified. i can hear her on her cell phone. she is crying. i am crying. i fucked up and just ruined my customer's day and have a new addition to the file of horrible things to think about right as i fall asleep.

tldr: couldn't remember what a customer looked like, wound up with a news clip loudly autoplaying how the customer died in a house fire - and i played it all of ten feet from his widow.

edit: okay i hate edits but now i understand why people do them. our faq of the day - no, my keyboard unfortunately does not have a volume button and i do try to keep my computer on mute. for what it's worth (i.e. not much at this fuckin point), the only reason it wasn't muted was because i was showing someone a coworker a video while we were opening. and yes, i probably shouldn't have done that either. 

there's a lot of love/hate about the bird thing. thank you for the compliments. if you said something mean i hope a real life non-metaphorical bird poops right on your head.

as far as what i'm going to do next. mrs. junts is coming back into the office next monday so i'm planning on talking to her in person then. thankfully i have a some days to practice because tbh, even though logically i know it was an innocent mistake, it still feels awful and it's hard to think about facing her. my coworker said she seemed okay when she left. and yes, i know that it was probably a mistake to run away but if i had any good judgement about any of this i wouldn't have a reason to post here in the first place.

adding another edit because my selfloathing knows no bounds. no, those are not their real names. i'm pretty dumb but i like to think i'm not *that* dumb.",4
"fiance wanted an open marriage, so i called off the wedding. people are asking questions. should i let them know why?. &#x200b;

for those that keep messaging me for an update, it was posted long ago, and it can be found **here**(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/99y261/update_fiance_wanted_an_open_marriage_so_i_called/).

&#x200b;

\-----

&#x200b;

two weeks ago we were two weeks away from getting married.

she asks me to go to therapy with her. she was already seeing a therapist on her own, and wanted me to go with her and have a talk, before the wedding, where we could be completely honest with one another. that sounded a little weird to me, i thought we were already completely honest with one another, after all, we were getting married in two weeks, right?

also, she was super protective about her therapy sessions, didn't really talk about them. i have never met her therapist. so to be invited there all of a sudden seemed a little out of place to me.

the day comes, and i go there. but out of self preservation, i had my phone opened and recording any audio.

my fiance was already there. i had to wait 20 minutes before i was invited in. the therapist greets me and shakes my hand. we have small talk. she tells me i am not at all the way my fiance described me. i think she is trying to compliment me. then she looks at my fiance and tells her ""this may be harder than we thought.""

that absolutely weirded me out. but i am a calm and collected individual, and i don't react, just kept that dumb smile on my face we all have in awkward situations.

so the therapist starts talking. has a small speech i don't care to repeat. my fiance takes my hand as the therapist starts telling me that ""we live in a modern world, and that my fiance wants us to have a non-conventional marriage moving forward.""

i smile, i am not sure what the hell that means, through my mind i am thinking she wants to talk how she will not be a slave to her husband, she will not sacrifice her work life, etc. modern woman and girl power and all that.

nope, she is actually talking about how once we get married, she wants to be free to sleep with other men.

the other non-traditional type of marriage. i forgot it's 2018.

but she loves me a lot, and would not be comfortable with me having the same ""benefits"".

because she would be too heart broken knowing that i find other women attractive and that one of them could steal me from her.

so i let them finish talking. they were very fluent, and they got more confident talking, probably empowered by my lack of reaction, and because i wasn't saying anything. this was definitely something they have rehearsed.

i then asked the therapist if she is licensed. this, by her reaction, was not what she expected to be the first thing coming out of my mouth. she said yes. so i told her to explain to my fiance why we will not be getting married any more, and why we will not continue being a couple starting immediately.

i wished them good luck, and left the office.

now, i want to report the therapist. i am not sure if i have to report her to the clinic, or is there a board that supervises therapists? i don't think their planning and attempt to corner me is professional conduct, and i want her to pay for the misconduct. that ""session"" did not sit well with me.

to be clear, there would have been no positive outcome to this talk my fiance and the therapist had with me. even if she wanted a completely open marriage, where i could sleep with other women, the outcome from my part would have been the same. that's is not a marriage, that is a sham.

it also dawns on me, she might have cheated on me. now that i have this clarity of mind, certain things don't match up.

so i was a fool anyway.

i listened to the recording, and i still can't believe what was said there.

anyway, i called off the wedding.

i am a very easy going guy, there are no fights with me because i am not seeking them. there are no conflicts, enemies, because my life is guided on principle and common sense. that might have given my ex the impression i will be easy to walk over, like a door mat, but she is an idiot for thinking that. having listened to the recording a few times, i am confident the therapist recognized i am not how my fiance must have described me in their sessions.

hence the ""this may be harder than we thought.""

now that the wedding is no longer happening, people are starting to ask questions i am not comfortable answering.

how do i navigate this sea?

i am sure my ex is doing damage control, but i have the recording, and if she goes too far off the path, i will not shy letting people know what she wanted us to talk about.

but my parents and family also want answers, and i am not sure what bs to tell them. i don't want them to think i am an idiot for allowing my ex to get to this point where she was so confident that she straight out told me she wants to fuck other dudes.

she is also blowing my phone, my best friend's phone, my brother's phone.

""we can work on this"", ""i didn't understand what they were telling me in the therapy session"", ""she will do anything to fix this"", ""it was the therapist's idea, she was against it"", etc.

last cry of a dying siren. all her cries fall on deaf ears, and i am the owner of said ears.

we were also working to get a loan to buy a house, but i cancelled everything.

i basically erased any ties we had financially, or otherwise.

her current plea is that in therapy she exposed her insecurities about our sexual history. i had considerably more partners than her, and the therapist came up with the idea we should ""level the field"".

regardless of the truth of this, that therapist gets reported once i figure out where to do it, and what to say.

this post is mostly a rant, but i would also want to know how would you handle the questions of friends and family. my ex is certainly doing her own damage control, and i don't want to be a he said / she said. i do have the recording, and am wondering if i should send it to the interested parties.

my ex doesn't know i have the recording.",8

"meta you can still be the asshole if you were wronged. i've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, i've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. op was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? and there is a resounding chorus of nta! you don't owe anyone anything! or someone was mean to op, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. aita?  no! they were rude so you get to be as well! 

i dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. these reactions are understandable. but just because its understandable doesn't mean op can't be the asshole. 

being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. people make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  it is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown.

"for surrendering my sister's child to protective services when she forced me to babysit due to mental health?. i'm 26m, my sister is 28f. we're the only family we both have, neither of our parents are with us anymore and we have no aunts, uncles, or cousins. i'm single, so is my sister: she's a single mother of a 3 year old. despite all of this, we're not particularly close. we live in the same city but i might see her once a year in passing.

to make a long and convoluted post short, last week she came to my house and offloaded her son to me. she said she had to go to the hospital for mental health and i was the only person who could help. i couldn't even protest, she didn't even come inside. she took him in the car seat, put him on my porch, rang the bell, and told me all of this as she's walking back to her car. she left no diapers, no supplies, no nothing, not even a word of when she'll be back.

it took me less than four hours to contact police and have child services involved. he was basically abandoned with me, or at least that was my thoughts. they took the child away and my sister is still in the hospital. i have no way of contacting her, nor has she tried to contact me. i can't imagine the hellstorm that's going to be unleashed when she's out.

i'm just not equipped to handle a kid. my home isn't child proof, i have no friends who could babysit for a stranger, even as a favor. i work full time, i'm in school. i couldn't think of any alternative besides getting child services involved. i feel like i let my sister down but first and foremost i believe she let her own child down. i don't know what's going to happen.

was i the asshole?

**edit**: just so there's more info, i wasn't even left the base the car seat latches into. never mind i don't even have a car. i'll admit i could have asked a friend for help picking up children stuff but that doesn't address anything else.

child services is what its name implies, here where i live it's called facs. they work with families in struggling times like this. i told them my sister's name, the hospital she's at, and they presumably are working with her to sort this out. they left contact information but they won't disclose any status to me because i'm not the parent. even just the status of my sister, they weren't at liberty to say.

i didn't ""put the kid up for adoption"" it doesn't work like that. i contacted this agency who is trained to help in situations like this, where living arrangements are difficult or impossible for a child. my best guess is they have him in a foster home for now until my sister's out. i don't know anything else beyond my best guess.

and i can't just take time off work or school to care for a child 24/7 when agencies like the one i contacted can offload the work for me. it's been 8 days and no word on anything: if i took eight days off work with no telling when i could return, i might as well not return.",3
"for telling my kid i would help him get a switch if he can beat ocarina of time?. my 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a nintendo switch so he can play botw. right now he has $200 saved up. at his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

i know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn't been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. now i have to say, he's a really good kid. kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. he's been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, i thought of a more fun solution to help him get his switch. i told him, if you can beat ocarina of time (without googling for help - though i would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old n64, i'll pay for the rest of your switch and get you botw. wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. part of my reasoning too is i just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and oot is a timeless classic. 

he jumped at the idea! after a weekend of playing, he's already at zoras domain as young link. he seems to be having fun with it and hasn't gotten too frustrated yet. he's only played minecraft really so the dated graphics don't bother him either. 

but anyway i told a couple friends about it, and they think i'm a massive dick. that i'm trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that i should just get him the switch because he's already such a good kid. now i'm having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge.

damn i got a ton of great advice on my post, thanks guys. reading your comments made me realize that i'm probably a dumbass and should have thought about it more. she didn't have any trauma but her family was pretty religious and conservative growing up which i relate to, my parents were the same way and they never talked about sex or anything. but it was different in my house, they knew or assumed i would jerk off, they said little things sometimes and acted like it was completely normal. i got her before she fell asleep and asked her about it. she told me that they never mentioned masturbation or sex (we had our own ... interesting problems with that too) as if it didn't even exist but she knew it was bad and she couldn't ask about it or anything. 

it was good, we had a long talk about it like a discussion, we were just talking. no judgment, it was nice, i missed her. basically she had only started doing it when she was 19 and she liked it but always felt guilty afterwards because she felt disgusting. she tried to stop and it was hard and she saw it as a big personal struggle but she eventually ""quit"" around probably a year later and hadn't done it for a long time. so when we met, she was masturbation free and wasn't lying all this time when she said she didn't do it. 

and then when she walked in on me, she started thinking about it and just started doing it again sometimes because it was fun and she still felt guilty so when i saw her, she felt embarrassed. she admitted that her teasing me and mentioning for weeks was her projecting and trying to make herself feel better in some way. i told her it was completely fine and normal and her private business to do what she wants, no fap or pro fap. obviously i didn't change her deep rooted views so quickly. i tried telling her that i knew she felt gross but my view of her didn't change at all and i still love her the same and she liked that and gave me a hug. so that's that. she didn't cry again but she did talk to me with her head under the comforter. i know a couple comments told me not to do this but my brain screwed up and i said that it was so hot and i wanna watch her. she felt embarrassed and told me not to hold my breath but maybe one day. we're good now. had breakfast together and she was fine and back to normal. 

thanks for all the help. i knew i wanted to bring it up but all the pointers and lines really helped. we talked for a while and opened up an interesting discussion, it was good. 

some people mentioned that she may have been thinking about someone else, had someone hidden under the covers or our sex isn't good. that's definitely not it lol. and just wanted to say that the comments calling her a hypocritical bitch are really fucking weird. i did not make that post thinking ""wow my bitch girlfriend has double standards, i should have continued to tease her, it's what she deserved, she made jokes on me for weeks, how fucking dare she, i'm gonna get revenge"". i love her, she's my girlfriend, not my enemy. i can take a couple harmless jokes about choking the chicken, it's not that serious. some of you guys have a concerning lack of empathy. and the comments about her being immature and needing to grow the fuck up and act like an adult. again, real lack of empathy. no one's perfect, everyone has their own problems.",8

"for making gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?. so, i've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. but basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

i've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

well, it didn't stop. 

anyway, since i'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, i've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until i kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

the noises are kind of, like, skreeeeeeeoooooooash! skreeeeascchhhhh! followed by snorts and the like.

so far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what i'm doing downstairs. i brush it off like it's no big deal and i really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. his audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor gargoyle rears its ugly head.

"for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?. tl;dr at bottom

okay so i'm almost 19.

when my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. they got married later on, converted to christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

i know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. he didn't say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. i thought it's weird they never told their daughters, given that they're all such protestors against abortion.

but anyways dad also has a sister, who's daughter i'm really close with. she's christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last may. then her boyfriend left her over it. i absolutely adore her baby, and i try to help raise him given that he doesn't have a father.

i'm usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle's daughters, and i was messaging them three way last night. i was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why i would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

i told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. but they overrode me, saying that she's easy and shouldn't have spread her legs blah blah blah. it went on for a few more messages.

i got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

""yeah i hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.""

three hours later and there was still no response; i knew i was in deep shit.

and i was! my parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning i'm using my old old old phone right now. they were very tense with me today. i was very earnest.

i've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what i made on day-care.

so in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""good luck with the mortgage and bills, i've taken my money out of our bank account and turned off your card on my credit"". i would say i was shocked, but i really am not. he's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

i obviously need an attorney, i logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. what resources can i begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until i can find childcare and a job? is there anything i can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? i understand it's all ""his"" money but we are married with a child. i don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.

"for refusing to support my wife through her diagnosis after her infidelity. my wife and i had a pretty normal marriage. no kids, both employed and really happy together. for 99% of our relationship we didn't have any major problems, we made time for each other, so on and so forth. 

she recently went away with her friend for a girls trip. the first two days after she came back everything was fine, and on the third we went to dinner with this friend and her boyfriend. dinner went well, came home and went to bed. wife woke me up in the middle of the night crying saying there was something she had to tell me. long story short, she had cheated on me the entire trip and her friend had cheated on her boyfriend as well, apparently the dinner together caused her to have an attack of conscience because she messaged my wife after i had fallen asleep telling her that she was going to come clean to her partner and my wife had to tell me as well or she would.

we talked, yelled, cried. i spent most of the night sick. told me it was just a horribly stupid decision and was perfectly happy with me (which honestly makes it worse, why risk a happy marriage for an affair), it wasn't my fault, the usual. i've been staying at my sister's place while we figure out the divorce.

before this went down she had been scheduled for tests and scans for what we thought were relatively non-serious health problems. turns out we were wrong, as i was just contacted last week by her cousin telling me a scan revealed cancer. i got in touch with my wife and we talked, she proved her diagnosis and filled me in on some details. she was understandably terrified and begged me to come back, to talk to her, hug her, give her a chance, to be there with her. i told her i wished her all the best, i'm very sorry for what she's going through and know she's strong enough to make it through but while i'd help financially from a distance, i wasn't physically going back.

they (not her) have been harassing me, telling me to man up and go to her. my own friends are split 50/50. i don't want to go back. before anyone pulls the ""this is probably why she cheated!"" card, no. we had a good marriage, we had a sit-down talk every month to discuss anything wrong. we were solid. she just chose to take a chance on a quick thrill, despite knowing cheating is a 100% dealbreaker for me. she never even planned to tell me until her friend forced her. while i certainly don't think anyone deserves this and i am sorry it happened to her, in my opinion her diagnosis doesn't change our situation. i feel it'll be harder on both of us with me being there knowing i won't forgive her when it's over. it feels like prolonging the inevitable, and i feel like my obligation to her ended when she chose to betray our marriage. she has family and friends so she isn't alone. i care about the woman i thought i married, but i no longer love who she turned out to be, so i feel it'd be unfair to both of us for me to be there. i'm not trying to punish her, my heart just isn't in it anymore. aita?

**edit**: to the reddit detectives further down. when i said ""we talk every month"" about our problems, it doesn't mean we only talk once a month in strict time slots. we talked as often as needed, but made a point at least once a month to sit with each other and check in, see how we're feeling and so on. secondly, i mentioned she proved her diagnosis because when i was told i didn't believe it, i figured it was a ploy to get me to come over and talk because she and her family had been trying to get me to reconsider from the moment i left. i also didn't want numerous answers to be filled with that exact same speculation. as far how she cheated the ""entire"" trip, the two of them went with the purpose of meeting up with two specific people her friend knew. and i figured this would be easy to figure out but i guess not, i knew her friend forced her to tell me because i demanded to see their messages after she told me she cheated. finally, i know a lot of people post made up stories. i'm not one of those people, but short of providing personal details i can't prove it. if i wanted karma i wouldn't be on a throwaway, i posted here because when some of your own friends are telling you that you're unreasonable i think it's time for neutral third party judgement and i was hoping for valuable insight, which many people provided. to the mods, i'm sorry this post wasn't a great fit here. i'll post in the appropriate subs in the future.",3

"during my first surgery as a 3rd year medical student. 
i'm a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship ""assisting"" on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. in this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. if you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. as this was my first laparoscopic surgery, i soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. like many of you, i had no idea this role even existed, but i quickly accepted my new job as 'vagina sealer'. i approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. i placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. after several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  the attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said ""do you know where the vagina is? get that stopper out of her ass!""

"for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face. my newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. it requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

enter lady with four kids: a newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). she really really should have brought an ipad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. the mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. she was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. ffs at one point when i wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. my newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and i did not feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

i tried being polite about it ""sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""ma'am!"" -points to kid- the lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. rinse and repeat. i told her she needed to stay with her mom. little punk deadass says ""i don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


finally, i'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? why is your baby crying! make him stop! i don't like that"" and her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. so now i'm out formula, kid still screaming, and i have a huge mess that i don't have a great way to clean up. 

i'm at my wits end. i raise my voice at this kid. ""look what you did. i am not your mom, i am not your babysitter. you are bothering me. get out of my face!!"" 

people looked at me like i was the biggest bitch on earth. a lady speaking spanish actually did call me a bitch. the little girl starts crying. i'm not apologizing. the mom confronts me, i tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill i'm prepared to die on.

"for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?. we had a family dinner this evening. my family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29f), younger sister (24f) and youngest brother (22m).

extended family attended our family dinner. so all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. during the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. my sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. the two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

eventually my sister got really fed up and said ""shut up, i'm not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin."" my brother hadn't done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. i think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

anyway, i immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. she replied by saying everyone knows he's a virgin and she didn't say anything wrong. this annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn't need to be made fun of like this.

so i responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it's not a big deal right? turns out her husband didn't know this amazingly, i genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

"my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. nsfw. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

so, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, sarah 31f, my long-time partner, john 34m, and myself 29f.

i've known that sarah has had a crush on john for a long time. it's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, sarah has never crossed any boundaries. but because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(my boyfriend and i had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while i'm sleeping. she took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. she apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

i found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad i'm being abused.

but here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. he took the photos and videos *for me*. the day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so i can watch them because it's better than porn. 

but nobody believes me. they're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. i don't know what to do. i'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

how do i fix my friendships and convince everybody that **i'm** the one who wanted it? 

there is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but i do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. i'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

please help. i'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

edit: since this needs to be said, yes, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. it's a four digit code.

edit edit: 

- yes, i *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- i have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. just *mostly* everybody. i was upset and generalizing last night.

- i am in the us.

- my boyfriend **does have a passcode** on his phone. seriously. stop blaming him. this is *definitely* not his fault.

edit again since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and i: we attended a bbq where everybody left their phones inside. we *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

you guys are being a little mean about this.

**edit** (again): 

went to the police and will update when i can.

## minor update 

i went to the police last night, alone. after everything that was said, i was nervous about having john with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

really. y'all made me nervous.

i went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

at first, the officer at the window was like, ""i think that's a crime? maybe? i've gotta call my supervisor.""

that happened twice before the police were like, okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. we're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

i gave my report and left. about fifteen minutes later, i got a phone call from the local pd. they told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

my comments being that sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue john and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

they suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, i'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

so, that's about it. 

a bunch of hemming and hawing and i don't knows. they'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

i'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",8

a year ago, he got orders to move to texas from where we all were in california. my older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. i approached my ex and told him the situation. i said i know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. he blew his top and said absolutely not, i wouldn't ""take his kids away"" and said he'd see me in court.

the judge ended up ruling in his favor, and i was awarded summers and every other holiday. i was absolutely devastated. i moved, and i've barely seen the kids since. they came at christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. the older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on facetime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much. my daughter has said i chose a man over her, and that she wants nothing to do with me, while my son won't talk about it but i can tell he's angry.

"by trying to buy an instant pot at target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist. this started yesterday but i didn't realize my fu until today.

yesterday, i stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt instant pot at target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. i decided i would get some christmas shopping done early and flip a few. i ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. i go to target and give them my id, they look it up and can't find it at first. i give them the order number and i hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. the one says he has to let the manager know i'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but i didn't think much of it.

fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. the doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. i step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the state police counter terrorism unit and they start questioning me about why i'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if i know what they can be used for, if i'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the target parking lot. i did my best to explain the price mistake and how i found it, etc. i think they accepted my explanation but i'm still nervous that i'm on a watchlist now.

tl:dr tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 instant pots at target, got interrogated by state police counter terrorism unit why i was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

if you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. some guys want to date you plain and simple. these guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. these guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. but it's not the same as a platonic friendship. if you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things:

on the way home, i ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. she pulls her light blue jeep into the parking lot, i stumble out of the jeep, go in, and complete my purchase.

the screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so i couldn't really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when i heard, clear as a bell, ""you fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.""

my ex did move out. thankfully, moving day was uneventful, and then he was gone. and as many commentators predicted - when he was gone from the house it was a huge relief. i didn't have to cringe at every little sound anymore. i could breathe again. i was really, really sad - but my space was my own.

aaaand then i got laid off. no joke. helluva one-two punch right there.

the past two years have, on the whole, been incredibly painful. the year that my marriage fell apart, and then the year i had to spend recovering from that blow. i had to job hunt while mourning the death of my relationship, and as soon as i found a new job i also found out my house needed hugely expensive repairs that, after all of this mess as well as having supported my ex not working for a year, i just didn't have the cash for. and figuring out how to be on my own for a while - i had people there to support me, but in the day to day, hour to hour through this mess i was ultimately on my own, and that was hard. (bingeing 'the marvelous mrs. maisel' helped a bit.)

he also kept reaching out. for a while it was occasionally chatty, but as time went on and i came more to terms with how he'd treated me, and how frequently his messages had a tinge of emotional manipulation to them, i distanced myself. he messaged me once to ask if i regretted our entire relationship, on the whole, or if i thought he was a terrible person, on the whole. i didn't respond to that one at all. then he'd reach out with things like ""hey, the tv i took from our living room broke, do you want it from me? like to sell or try and fix?"" i've been doing my best to keep my responses short and clear, in ways that don't invite follow-up. lately he's been wanting to have a post-mortem conversation, to which i said that i wouldn't be ready to consider whether or not that'd be a good idea until our legal ties were ended. (he also just messaged to ask if he could be my roommate, because his rent is really high. i have no words.)

&#x200b;

the good news - and there's thankfully quite a lot of it - the new job i got is possibly the best job i've ever had. a step down in salary, but i'm super happy with the work and the people and the location, and i've been getting rave reviews from coworkers and management, enough that i think i can probably negotiate a decent raise in a few months. i had to get a new car as well (new to me, but purchased used) since my ex got the car we shared in the split, and i was nervous about negotiating and buying a car by myself, which i'd never done before. but i did it - and managed to negotiate the dealer about $1k down - and i absolutely love the car.

also - i met someone new. this person reminds me of my ex in a lot of ways - things like shared hobbies and creativity and sense of humor and charm - but very different in some really important ways. he treats me really well. he's thoughtful and kind and generous - not just to me, but to everyone. in the conflicts we've had (very few) we are able to talk through them calmly - no yelling! - and he shows me how much he respects and cares about my perspective and boundaries and autonomy. he's not broken and doesn't need me to fix him - and i'm not broken either, thank god. maybe carrying a bit of extra baggage, but such is life. this relationship is still new, but it feels like a game-changer for both of us, and i'm excited to see where it leads.

&#x200b;

and one more bit of good news - i will officially be divorced on friday! (yes, the day after valentine's day xd ) there are a few more loose ends to wrap up after that, but not many.

&#x200b;

i wanted to provide this update in part because i know it can be nice to see updates from folks, but also because i wanted to give a bit of hope to anyone who might be in a situation like mine. it can get better. it really, really can. i'm actually happy. it took time and hard work, and things aren't perfect - i'm definitely going to need a lot of time to recover financially, and i'm still sometimes processing the weight of 11 years of emotional abuse (a+++++ for therapy) - but i'm actually truly happy. sometimes i wonder how much of the depression i'd been feeling before he left was the result of how much emotional weight i'd been carrying for so long - his and mine - without truly being aware of it. it's so easy to feel like that dark tunnel is all there ever will be, when you're in the middle of it - but i'm out in the sunshine now, and it feels amazing.",8

&#x200b;

well, it's been like 12 days. the long and the short of it: the truth came out. wedding has been put on hold while ""she gets help"" and i am left to pick up the mess and deal with everyone. i need a stiff drink and a vacation.

&#x200b;

a lot of people said some things that really struck with me. the photo of the stripper seemed to be odd, and you're right, it made no sense. why would he take a picture that was so compromising? why would he risk possible criminal charges if someone felt he went too far? how was he so cavalier? i sat her down and demanded the whole truth. we talked the night that i posted and we talked from 6ish until 3 or 4. we went moment by moment, step by step, and i demanded to know what happened. so, here's what *actually* happened:

&#x200b;

they got together for pre-fun cocktails and dinner but ate very little. they drank and drank and then had a hotel room booked as their base of operation from which they'd change and go to a club then crash at the end of the night. they got to the hotel and everyone was drunk. instead of cooling their jets, they wanted to have more fun. two of the bridesmaids suggested getting topless (one is a school teacher and the other is a surgical nurse...) and then my fiancees bright idea? *get high.* but on what you might add? oh, only painkillers she illicitly procured during her mother's final months and had been taking to help deal. yeah, fucking lovely. my mil had been on dilaudid, ativan and others. they all popped a pill, finishing the bottle and then the moh's surprise - a stripper. so, who took the pills *and drank?* only my future wife. yeah, the rest of them realized that was a shit idea and instead just stuck to booze. it's why my fiancee was fall-down dumb and couldn't hold herself together. my fiancee doesn't drink, so i should have connected the dots there. that's on me i guess.

&#x200b;

the reality of the stripper is that they jumped around topless, drank and laughed while my fiancee was stoned and drunk. stripper never fingered her. she kissed him then he kissed her neck and she hugged him but he was clear what the rules were and not only did he not touch her but they are pretty sure he ended things early and left to avoid a problem. the photo was a set-up and she was wearing underwear but not much else. she then admitted she would have fucked the stripper so that i would leave her. she said that she was mad at her mother for declining treatment early on and for her father for not pushing her into treatment earlier. she was mad at the whole situation and she began to take some pills. then she was mad she was taking the pills and wanted to put distance between us. i couldn't figure out what pills she was taking until it dawned on me: near the end her mother was in pain and they gave her a prescription that made her really sick so another was issued. i thought the pills were destroyed but i guess my fiancee didn't do that - i had no reason to assume she would lie. in the years we've been together/known each other she's drank maybe 3 times and been really seriously drunk only once. i didn't think she'd do that.

so, that brings me to the texts. i ask her why, if she would have fucked that guy to hurt me, she didn't want me to know. she explained that she felt horrible guilt, didn't know what to do and realized it wasn't what she wanted and got scared that i was going to find out and leave her. her moh, who hired the stripper, wanted me to know about the drugs and thought she could scare her into telling me. her bridal party were divided all wanted the wedding to proceed but half wanted her to disclose the pills she stole and the others didn't. by this point i didn't know what to do.

i followed advice given her and said we needed to delay the wedding. she began to panic and begged me not to. she started making bizarre fucking suggestions - we could do whatever i wanted for the next year and even offered to let me hit her to get back but begged me not to walk away from us. she then said she had a problem and needed help, her dad is a nice guy but not emotionally all that available. she said that without me she'd be alone and that despite everything she loved me. that i don't actually doubt, i think she really does love me.

&#x200b;

so what happened?

&#x200b;

she saw her doctor on monday who immediately used the words ""abuser"" and ""addict"" and strongly recommended blood tests, medical tests and a referral to a psychiatrist. we got the name of the doctor and i guess they move quickly because by the following day she was meeting with the psychiatrist. he recommended different types of therapy. we had a ""group meeting"" and he's said my wife is absolutely an addict - she was using the prescription pills and alcohol and my fiance admitted she had been drinking on the sly for some time. she's taken a leave from her work and is in group therapy sessions, meeting with a psychologist and recuperating by focusing on diet, exercise and self-improvement. we're down to one salary (mine) and absolutely cannot afford extras, so the wedding is currently on hold.

&#x200b;

this meant that i had to have very uncomfortable conversations with everyone, including my family, her family and our friends. her father talked to me and told me that he feels terrible. he knows he has trouble being emotionally available and said that he wasn't really there for his daughter and felt horrible. my parents are well-to-do and helped with some bills that unexpectedly came in and have been helping a lot with everything. my fiancee has been going to my parent's house to work with my mother on gardening and to do other things around the house. the bridal party & maid of honor came to meet with me and bought me breakfast. they admitted that they suspected she had been taking the pills as she was a little looser with them and felt that the bachelorette party was a huge mistake. she drank way too much and they didn't stop her. i thanked them for their apology but said i didn't know what to say. they just offered their apologies and said that i was a great guy.

&#x200b;

the long-and-the-short of it is we're not sleeping in the same room. we aren't having sex. we are right now in this weird healing phase. her team has recommended i see individual therapy which i haven't yet had the time to do. a lot of bills have come in and we've delayed the wedding - no rest for the wicked, i guess. my parents have been absolutely wonderful in all of this.

&#x200b;

fiancee and i are in a weird place. she's overly nice and sympathetic. since she's home, she cooks a lot more, focuses on tasks around the house and has been working hard on exercising. she submits to drug tests and we have a bactrack if i'm concerned she's drinking. i'm a lot more aware of what's going on. she's attended a secular sobriety organization and meets with them. she's in group therapy and individual therapy.

&#x200b;

i kind of feel like i got shat on again and don't have a next move planned. people keep telling me to watch out for myself, but i'm not sure what to do.

&#x200b;

so that's what happened. i'm stunned and confused. turns out people can really surprise you, and not always in a good way. i still love her and depending on how things go, we'll see about getting back to a place where we can think about a wedding. for now, i'm going to eat some bacon and try to enjoy the weekend.",8
"i hooked up with a guy in my airport hotel room this morning before checking out. turns out he is on the same flight as me and guess what, he's traveling with his wife and kids.. i know reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. this morning i was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. so i got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. so i said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. after 45min to an hour of fun, i thought i'd never see this dude again because i'm flying home this afternoon (right now).

wrong. i went to the gate when they started boarding. guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? you guessed it. to make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and i can hear all their conversations. i'm in the plane right now and he keeps texting. i am saving screen shots in case i need them in the future. i'm sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

this is so uncomfortable.

tl;dr: hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. turns out he's married, and he and his family are on my flight home.

edit: i gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. he texted me just now telling me he found me on ig and fb so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. now i definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.

edit 2: a) i'm male. b) the wife does not know. he texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. and then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet i saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) c) i knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies

just wanted to respond to popular questions.

"for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""?. i am 24m and i have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. she is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. i have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. lately i feel like i've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

last week i won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. she also happens to like this singer so i asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. i said i can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. she said she'd love to go, but only as friends. she says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. she told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. i said i'll think about it. i was quite hurt because honestly i don't have much experience with rejection, and i was annoyed that she turned me down. 

today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. she immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. still, i'm taking her out for drinks on friday. but just now, the friend who i asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. i told her honestly that i already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

when i told my sister about what happened, she said i'm being really douchy. she says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and i should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. i said she can't understand because she's not a dude. because let's me honest, if i had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously i'm taking the second one. for just being honest about what i want?

**edit**: because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: yes i would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. nowhere do i even say that we have to share a bed...

but the part where she says she's not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. she likely said she'll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. so why would i make the experience awkward for the both of us when i could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **edit over**",3

"(update) neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

i'm sad about this update for the kid, i took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because i had questions about an issue i'm having and briefly explained it.

officer shows up, i invite him in and explain the whole situation. he isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. supervisor shows up and i go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where i have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

we watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. a few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what i put on the drive and then signed it, i repeated it all 3 times.

about 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 cps workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. this took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as i remember it and left out anything i wasn't 100% sure on.

the officers and cps workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times i'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

after they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. i'm in my garage so i don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the cps workers van and they left. the father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

i talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

i haven't seen them since the day after the post, i feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (i didn't think it was anything like they found, i just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). i should have called them earlier once the cps reports i was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.",2

we spoke via text and then i called her at lunch. it escalated where i was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that i should trust her.

i stated they can be friends, but i expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something i'm comfortable with, and i try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because i know better.

i expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

she doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200b;

i don't think she cheated. i know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. some men are okay with that, i'm evidently not.

"by making fun of anti-vaxers at my new job in front of my pregnant and (apparently) anti-vaxer manager.. so i just started in this company a few weeks back. i'm your typical shy person that in the first few weeks doesn't say much and really needs some time to get comfortable with the new situation and new people. starting this job it was no different.

now, a few weeks later i'm starting to feel comfortable around everyone and also starting to make jokes and joining non-work related discussions between co-workers. somehow we landed on the topic of old diseases that nowadays barely occur. my manager named a few and i said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.

then i jokingly said, 'and nowadays you don't know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.' ...

my co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. she raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. it was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.

"my aunt is taking me to court after my mother's suicide and has accused me of ""killing my mother"". a few months ago my mother killed herself. i (22m) am her only son. my parents are divorced, and i had not seen my mother for a long time (about 2 years) due to the fact that i was living in asia teaching english. i promised my mother that i would visit her when i returned home (she recently moved to a different state from my father), but about a half month before i came home, my grandfather on my dad's side became very ill and would not live much longer. my mother told me i should visit my father first because of this.

i should also add, that at this time and the past few years, i was very, very depressed and had some mental and physical health problems that would not improve. i really wanted to be at my home where i felt comfortable (my dad's house) and recover for some time. when i got home, my grandfather passed away on the day i arrived, and i was not feeling well enough to travel at all, so i stayed with my father for a few weeks.

later, my mother told me she would visit her parents (in another state) in a few weeks. i debated visiting her at that time, but i wasn't sure i would be feeling well enough to travel again. my grandmother (mother's side) called me and asked me to come at that time, but i told her i would have to think about if i can come then. eventually i decided that i would visit them at the same time as my mother.

the night i arrived at my grandparents house was one night before my mother and aunt would arrive. that night, my aunt called us and told us that my mother had just killed herself and they found the body at her apartment in the afternoon. i was driving home from the airport at that time. i remember that night so vividly as i could not sleep and was crying so hard my body hurt.  my aunt arrived a few days later, and we stayed together for some time. i noticed my grandmother's behavior was quite unusual at this time, and my mother had mentioned previously that she was beginning to show some dementia symptoms but both my aunt and grandmother were not hostile to me at this time. they seemed like they wanted to stick together and get through it as a family.

after about a week i returned to my father's home and stayed there. i was an emotional mess for the following month. i had a lot of trouble remembering simple things and felt exhausted all the time. eventually i began to feel better and start to move things forward with my mother's probate and planning my own life, when my grandmother and aunt call me to tell me that ""this is my fault"" and ""you killed your mother."" i was absolutely shocked to hear them say this. they accused me of not calling her enough, not wanting to visit her, only caring about her money (even though she was a teacher with a small condo and was not wealthy) etc. they even insulted my father. relatives from my father's side called me to help me through this, but i have not spoken to my aunt or grandmother since this incident. i know both my grandmother and aunt feel immense guilt for my mother's death. especially my aunt since it was her who suggested my mother come to live near her, and my mother hated living in that area.

today i received an email from my aunt that told me that i would have to go to court. it simply stated that i should call this lawyer. i am so hurt that this is how they decided to handle a tragedy like this. it's so difficult for me to think clearly, and i can't believe that this is how they chose to behave. any advice would be appreciated. i feel like i missed a lot of details, so feel free to ask me questions if need be.

aside from the seasoning (yeah, agreed that this only really happens with some chip types), the bigger part of this for me is that the little crunched up pieces fall into the big chips, so you get big chips that are topped with tiny more seasoned chips throughout the bag.

also agree from a health standpoint, the better lpt is probably to eat fewer chips :-p but nothing wrong with treating yourself every now and then.

"tangled was a better movie than frozen.  tangled had a better storyline than frozen. tangled was about escaping a toxic environment and finding one's self. for all rapunzel's life, she was stuck in a tower having one view of life. her mother told her that the world was cruel and unforgiving. while her mother was partially right about the world, (the stabbington brothers were kind of evil) they also were good people. while on her adventure, she learned not to judge based on appearance. she even had a musical number with people that were considered thugs. rapunzel was also an icon. she didn't need eugene but knew when to accept help. she saved eugene and herself many times during the movie with a frying pan. even the song ""i see the light"" was better than let it go. the song is about her finding the light and finding a new perspective with eugene. she admits that she was blind when she was in the tower. let it go is a good song but its not as good as ""i see the light""",6

edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. i hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because i sounded like i wanted a cookie for being a dad. it may have sounded like i wanted credit for some shit i'm supposed to do. 

that's not the case. i've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and i'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then i play with my kid so i'm not just there on my phone. its not the same for us. we don't have the same resources. although some of you have suggested some that i hadn't heard of. 

anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and i think that may be how it came across. thanks for all your support and for making me feel like i'm doing good as a parent. 


edit 2 - well this blew up. i'd like to say that i really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. to those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why i put this in unpopular opinions. not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

as has been repeatedly pointed out, i know i'm not a full time single parent. i'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. sometimes its hard. just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. i can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

edit: this post got more traction than i was expecting. i'd really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where i am. i grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. from elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

they've had dramatic changes over the years. in high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). a decade later, i can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. it's become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. many middle/high school kids have lan parties. smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). my library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

even though i prefer pin-drop silence, i have no issues with these changes. **it's better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. and putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!",9

edit1: well this went out of proportion. rip my inbox. 

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man! 

edit 2: getting a tons messages from the  people who were adopted. 
you guys are amazing, yes some of the replies on this post are harsh. but a lot of them are positive as well. we can always look on the brighter side. love and respect to your parents who loved you and raised you like their own.
keep them stories coming, i'll reply to everyone of you!

"college isn't the only way to start a good career. apprenticeships, trade schools, and military training can be great alternatives in today's world.. the price of four-year universities in the us, among other countries, is huge and growing. there are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

if, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**to high school juniors and seniors:** 

your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. if you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. here(https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

these jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. as that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. according to this article(http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. anecdotally, i work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**is there any money in it?**

there definitely can be. unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. i'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until _ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt later. 

that's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. there are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. you're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**what are my options?**

there are a ton of ways to start a career, but i'll talk about a few.

**apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

a recent report(https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from npr took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in germany's industrial success. the us government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. the federal program is here(https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest american job center(https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

the federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. in a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. one example would be the ibew(http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so i won't bother trying to list a bunch. searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**trade schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. there are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. it isn't for everyone as i understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but i know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. a computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**military** training can also be a great economic ladder. the pay and benefits are good from the start. depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. there are some huge risks associated with this route though, so i would reserve it as a last resort. 

regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. that is not the only income, though. in most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. that's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. on the outside, that would cost a lot.

regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. you could also be a bus driver. you don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. i would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. i really enjoyed most of the time i spent in the military. there were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. the good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. the bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

i know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. in reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**tl;dr**

if you want to get smart, go to college. if you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**edit:** based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. as a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the af lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""no thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

also about the military, i offered it up as a last resort, and i mean that. plenty of commentators are saying ""don't ever think about joining the military for training!"" i don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. you would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. if you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

regarding rotc, it is better than nothing. i intentionally didn't mention it though. my philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing rotc vs my immediate family and i enlisting. if you do rotc, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. after 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. if you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the af, can't say how easy it is in the others. so you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. from a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. additionally, i had a way better time than any officer i know, and i didn't even like the military. the lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. i wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

still relevant to rotc, but about school in general... a ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. i'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful lpt. you have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",9

so after i went home yesterday, i cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her.

i called her, she accepted my call and said ""what?"" i told her ""i'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

i texted her, ""i need the copy of my house keys back, i'm breaking up with you.""

she didn't respond. i got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

i looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. so i texted her ""where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

i drove back home and i noticed her car parked next to my house, i carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there i see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my ipad...) that's when i tell her ""what are you doing?"" 

she tells me, ""i'm taking back what's mine."" that's when i tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""get off me."" she started kicking me and ran out the house.

i tell her to give my shit back or i will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so i whip out my phone and dial the cops.

she drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my ipad.

cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and i told them what happened and i tell them the location of her house.

they sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics.

the cops start asking me questions like ""is this the first time?"".....

40 minutes later i got my stuff back.
she has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. however with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence. this can essentially amount to mob rule even if they are eventually proven innocent, reputations can be irreparable.

&#x200b;

tldr: dad thought i wasnt his kid and left me. now, it turns out i am his kid and he wants to be in my life again. but it's been four years and he was really shitty to me all this time, so i dont really want to be his pal. family says i'll regret not giving him a chance, and i came to the internet for perspective.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice, but i decided to go with my gradpa's (which was kind of the same most of you gave me) and i'll be standing my ground.

i've been really annoyed lately cause a lot of people around me keep saying i'm a crazy teen and i'll regret it. but grandpa made a point that i need to stop trying to decide how i'll feel in the future. cause truth is you can never know. you have to make decisions now, based on feelings and info you have now. not based on feelings and info you might have later.

right now, i´m disgusted by dad and brother. i want nothing to do with them. i don't trust them. and i even think there is a chance they might be doing this (reaching out) just for optics and money.

if my feelings change, i will deal with that when they do. cross the bridge when i get to it and all.

i wasn't really gonna post an update on this, cause i don't see the point. my story is kindda over.

but something happened yesterday and i wanted to share.

so i decided to stand by my ""fuck no, i don't wanna talk to them"". i'll be moving to another city soon and decided to change my number. grandpa is the only one who will be having the new one, i asked him not to share and i know he wont. he is a retired cop, so he's really badass and has zero patience for bullshit, my new number is safe. he called my mom and told her that, from now on, if anyone wanted to reach me, they'd have to go through him.

so mom showed up at his place (i've been living with him for a while) and tries to talk to me, but grandpa says she has to talk to him first, so he can decide whether she is allowed to talk to me or not. looool so mom goes insane, and starts telling him that it's none of his business and that this is between me and my dad, so grandpa goes something like ""if anybody shows up at my lawn to disturb the boy, i'll get the cops, a restraining order and a shotgun"". it goes on for a while until mom says i'm not the only family grandpa has, and that by doing this, grandpa is pushing everyone away and splitting the family, he has other grandchildren, why is he picking just the one, and so on... so grandpa fucking laughs and tell her that through no fault of his, this family blew up long ago, and everyone just grabbed a piece of what was left and ran for it. he looks at me and says i'm his piece, so he's not letting go and fuck it.

i was feeling like laughing up to this point cause mom was going crazy and all, but when he fucking said that, i broke. mom left after a while and i just hugged my old man like life depended on it, and he just said something like ""enough now, no need for that, i'm your family, family doesn't leave. you remember that when you have one of your own"", and i fucking will.

&#x200b;

tldr: won't be pals with dad and brother. i'm good. grandpa is the shit.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit - o, before i forget. some people were asking about what my siblings were like. well, my older brother stole/took shit that were mine or supposed to be mine, he lied to me and about me (and not the innocent kid lie, but fucked up shit that ruined relationships i had with friends, family, even a girlfriend i cared about). he was a huge bully for years, even hit me once. mom said ""he's going through a lot to"" and dad couldn't care less and just protected him. grandpa told him if he ever hit me again, he would break brother's teeth in. i guess he believed him, cause he never touched me after the one time.

younger brother is cool, i'd rather not talk about him here

&#x200b;

another edit - i read the comment section to grandpa, i had to explain what og is and he now wants to watch breaking bad and better call saul lol, but we thank you for all the love. reading the replies on my first post he just said ""the internet is very smart"", reading the replies on this update he got a little emotional and left saying he had stuff to do. but he got a beer, came back and asked if ""there were more people saying stuff"". the comment comparing him to clint eastwood made his day! thanks for the love guys",8

this morning i was walking to my car from my apartment and i had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. my neighbors basically jumped me from behind. one grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. he was saying stuff like ""the nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" as a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and i think my nose is fractured. most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that i was not about drink and drive, but that i was drinking apple juice. this all just happened. i'm calling the cops. any suggestions?

btw, i didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. they said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

update:

the police showed up. as soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

update #2:

both men were arrested and i will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. i will be talking to detectives. the police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ",2

"the glorification of weed on this site is extremely irritating. most people, on reddit or not, agree that opiates, cocaine, and even alcohol have negative effects on people and society at large. yet whenever someone points out the downsides of weed, they are immediately swarmed with ""its just a plant bro"" or ""weed is healthy!!1"" in spite of the fact that marijuana *can* have long term effects(https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/263936.php) on your brain especially if you start young. weed is arguably no different than other drugs in many respects, yet people act like it's some miracle plant or something. which is an absolutely terrible image of what it can actually be.

i'm not here to make a political statement or argue for or against the legalization of weed. that's a separate discussion imo. but i think people need to do their research instead of buying into stoner propaganda every day.",6

"wife died unexpectedly, discovered her affair. my wife died this past week unexpectedly. she was young and healthy, and the illness took her in hours. i thought things had hit rock bottom. she essentially died in front of me, and i was wracked by grief and guilt over her death. 

all things considered, i was coping as well as could be expected. make no mistake, i was going through the expected grieving reactions. i raged and hysterically cried for days. i went numb and then silent, then hysterical again. but i have good friends and i have been surrounded by family from both sides of the marriage. 

in the process of going through her belongings i discovered on her phone that she had been having an on and off affair for the last three years. it looks like she started cheating during a period where i was depressed after losing my job and father in the space of two weeks, both unexpectedly. after mourning for three months and seeking treatment for diagnosed depression, i was back at a new job. however, at the time she said that she felt lonely and that i was distant to her. in the following years we worked to try and mend our relationship but she would always come back to saying that things changed those months after my father's death. 

what more can life do to me? this man she was having the affair with appears to be an asshole that may have been abusing her, based on the text messages. he appears to be the exact opposite of me. i am a kind, generous, attractive, and intelligent person with a good career. the logical part of my brain knew that she had the capacity for dishonesty and selfishness, but i could never have imagined this. 

i am absolutely and totally devastated. the only saving grace is that we never had children. i wanted them and she did too, but she kept wanting to put it off. i suppose now i know the truth of why. 

i feel like i will never be happy again. ",8

original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ykrq1/mym25_girlfriend24_of_15_years_broke_up_with_me/

> as the title says, we broke up. it was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. we broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so i can see why it happened.
> 
> this isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any pda while i'm around. i still both consider them friends and i just want them to be happy.
> 
> for the most part, they are quiet at night. if i really listen i can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. except for last night. we went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. i was the dd because i don't really drink. anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. i made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. i then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. as i was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. she thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when i was ready. when i finally got to bed i could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. then it got quiet and then it started.
> 
> i don't know how long it lasted, but it was louder than normal. i've been okay with the break up until now, i'm glad they're happy but last night i fell asleep crying.
> 
> i woke up this morning, made breakfast for everyone and started to clean up.
> 
> feel free to ignore this, i just needed to get this off my chest. i'm sad when i really think about the situation, but that's why i try not to.
> 
> tl;dr: my ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

taking everyone's advice i announced that i was going to be moving out. my now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. i told him yes, but i'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. he decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. it's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. my landlord is xrms(ex-roommate) family friend, after xrm explained the situation i ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

xrm and xgf and a few other friends helped me move in. i had a house warming party and was specifically asked that i not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. xrm and xgf also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. my xgf stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. she said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. she told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. it was great. we've gone out a few times since our first date. 

the past few weeks have been the best in a long time, i never really realized how bad my situation was. obviously everything isn't perfect, and i still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but i'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

tl;dr: i moved out and started dating a new girl. ",8
"by fucking my dads couch. throwaway, because i don't want to become a notorious couch fucker on reddit.

this happened last week on saturday, because saturday and sunday is my father's custody time for me. saturday is also my dad's day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got ""called into work"" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.

this made me think about all the possible (private) things i could do to anything around the house. then i saw; **the $700 leather couch**. i executed my plan. 
materials needed: dish soap, a couch, and rags

i started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. then, i put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. then, the couch bestiality commenced. lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin i am, and there was no turning back. 

another detail about my dad getting called into work is that i was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. on a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. 

not today

he left at 9:30 am for work, and i was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which i felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn't supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. then it **happened**. the couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight

here(https://imgur.com/wi2nz1q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.

i heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. the knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. he gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words ""what the fuck are you doing"". i couldn't decide what to do, so i just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags i stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly ""sorry^sorry^sorry"". he walked back out but before he shut the door, he said ""don't clean that; im throwing it away, now."". the rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.

tl;dr: fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected 

edit: typo

edit no.2: holy shit yall blew this up.
i really, really, really appreciate the gold; regardless if this is a throwaway or not. my couch fucking earned me a dollar and i'm proud!",4

"by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my gf. minor background: i am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. i'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that i was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but i also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. i'm not gay, i just am me.

so while i was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. mine makes me look like a star wars character and his looks like the outlaw josey wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. the first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. whatever. so i get a call from my gf, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so i bid these mean girls and shawlbro adieu and head home.

i'm still wearing the shawl when my gf arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until i take it off. we get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if i'm gay. and she's really serious and aggressive about it. i tell her i'm not, that if i was i'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that i own a shawl. anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. so yesterday i invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to the big city, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually i just tell her very politely to get fucked because i'm pretty insulted by this point. on the way back, now that i'm not directly in front of her, i get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because i wore a shawl.

later on, i tell shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

we are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

tl;dr: me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

"update my father got my 14 year old sister pregnant.. a lot has happened since i posted.

i talked with my sister for a long time over the next week and she eventually agreed to talking to an adult at school. i went with her to talk to a teacher she was close with. after a lot of crying together she called the police and our school counselor and principal. they basically didn't let us go home that day from school. 

we ended up getting a case worker and parents of my sister's best friend (not the mom who was constantly harassing us about going public) took us in temporarily. we are currently still with them. 

the police visited my dad who won't admit to raping me or my sister, but they found a ton of child porn on his computer and other things they wouldn't tell us about. he has been arrested for the child porn. unfortunately, that did make the news and everyone knows. it's extremely embarrassing and stressful to have people judge you all the time. people wouldn't shut up about it for like two weeks. 

my sister moved to a different school that helps with troubled kids and special situations for while she is pregnant. we are hoping she can go back after she has the baby and continue at her first school... ideally.. 

she and i both have gone through a lot of counseling and she is okay giving up the child for adoption now. our case worker and counselor are both really great about this whole thing.  mom is still not in the picture.

i fully plan on changing my name to my mom's maiden name and so does my sister. my case worker says that's completely possible for us to do. thanks for that advice reddit, i got that from here. 

anyway, thanks for the advice. it helped me talk her into how serious it was.

"my husband has sex with me while i sleep wth?. ive been married 5 years,  the sex is good and usually regular (providing we're not fighting) but my husband has been having sex with me while i'm asleep. i know it sounds crazy! im a very heavy sleeper and he's taking advantage of it. on a few occasions i've awoke to him fingering me and about to put it in, if he knows i'm waking up, he stops. i am all for being woke up for sex but what is driving me crazy is that he stops every time and pretends like he isn't doing anything. i hate sleeping in clothes, i'm a naked sleeper but i don't think that is an open invitation right?

 last weekend, i woke up again to him trying to get his dick in me, he froze until i acted like i was still asleep, i wanted to see how far this was going to go.  i pretended to sleep and wake up 3 different times, everytime i ""woke up"" he pulled out, heart racing and held me in position real tight until i fell back asleep,  finally he finished all over me and went to get up to get a towel and i said.... was that good for you? he tried to act like he was asleep!!! i told him i was awake the whole time and asked why he did that and why he thought it was okay. his answer...i was horny, it wont happen again. 

fast forward a week...i haven't been talking to him all week. i go to bed with clothes on all week because the thought of him doing it again just disgust me. i confront him about it, he acts like it's no big deal, i'm his wife so it should be fine, he wouldn't care if i did that to him and when i asked why he stopped when i woke up he says because he knew i'd be mad, he didnt want to get caught. i am trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. i'm pretty open minded, if it was a fettish or something, maybe i could be ok with it but he will not give me anything. 

at this point in feel like i can't trust  him anymore and i don't know what to do. has anyone else ever dealt with this? do you think i should believe him? he is only admitting to doing it this 1 time even though i've told him i've caught him before.

last night while my so was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. she is a bartender and didn't want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. so i jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

while i'm making my journey, i decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. i'm in a pretty great mood. i had the day off and my so was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some new girl. 

my journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. just open desert. so while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. ""what can i do to add a little romance to this situation? cover the bed in some dove chocolates? maybe some flowers?"" 

i make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. miraculously, i made it back home before her.

finally i decide, ""nah, romance isn't nearly as great as comedy."" so when i get home, i break open the box and spell out ""anal?"" on the bed with the tampons. 

so gets home and goes straight to the room to change. i follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

she takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. now she won't stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is ""famous"". 

i've created a monster.

"if you're pro-choice, then you need to support the right to assisted suicide. it's the same concept imo. for women, it's their body and they have the right to choose whether or not to keep the child. i think the same concept should apply to suicide. if someone is miserable, depressed, chronically ill, disabled, etc, then it should be 100% their choice to end their lives. it's inhumane to force people to take their own lives using makeshift methods which can result in brain damage or permanent injury (shotgun, nitrogen gas, etc). obviously there should be safeguards to prevent spur of the moment suicides after a traumatic event or something, but the option for a safe, sanctioned suicide should be there after proper vetting.

edit: 

a lot of people are agreeing and saying ""i agree with this only for terminally ill people in pain."" my entire point is that you shouldn't be able to pick and choose who gets to kill themselves.

that's like saying only rape victims or medically vulnerable mothers should be allowed to get abortions. anyone should have access to a safe and reliable method of suicide, regardless of why they're doing it.",6

flash forward to the other night and i was pulled over for an improper lane change. officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when i was being pulled over. he asked to search the vehicle and which point i said no. waited half an hour for the dog to show up. he alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  he checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. after his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. they cut into the leather seats. they also cut into my spare tire. mind you, i have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. they cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. i'm obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. after this well over 2 hour ordeal, i was told i was free to go. when asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. before i do that i would like to know if there's any better options and how i should pursue this. the seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there's so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what i probably would've payed for it. not to mention they also ruined my spare. thank you.

"should i (23f) tell my boyfriend (26m) about the egg?. pretty short and sweet. together for 3 years, discussing marriage, have our own place finally, deeply in love. he admitted to me today that he has preemptively hid 50 eggs and 1 giant egg in our apartment for me to find tomorrow. this guy's pretty good! up until then i hadn't seen any. but i just spotted the giant one. i really didn't mean to, i haven't been trying to look for them. 

should i tell him so he can re-hide it? or do i take it tomorrow?

edit: i forgot to mention he had to tell me about the eggs because i was mentioning plans with eggs (we hide them together).

edit update: he came to the room and i said ""what if i told you i found the giant egg?"". he laughed and told me ""well, i got it way up there, since you found it early you'll have to work for it and get it down."" i jokingly pouted until he relented and said ""but if you need help i will."" 

i am not allowed to get it down until tomorrow though! will update then :)

mini update: doing my morning routine. so left for church with his family while i get ready to go and clean a gentleman's house and answer some of the reddit comments! one of the eggs was in my coffee pot. i guess some of these eggs don't stay closed very well, because it was taped shut as well as the ones sitting on my balcony table :) he put so much effort into this! i'm so touched, honestly. it kinda makes my kinky idea for egg hunting look lame by comparison! will be back later once we're both home and i can hunt down all the rest of the eggs

update: firstly, a couple people i think asked so here are the eggs in question(http://imgur.com/a/lw1xoy3). the reese's thing is more of a basket, but i won't question his use of the word egg to describe it. on the shelf i could only see a vague top part of it, but he did mention there's reese's for me in the ""egg"" xd. if you bother to count the little ones there's only 48; i took one with me to the house cleaning (and checked to make sure it was strictly candy inside first!) and ""hid"" it in the gentleman's kitchen. as for the last one, both of us swear i found it, but i must have dropped it somewhere? under the couch or something. idk. in the giant egg there was candy and a frisbee. 

for everyone waiting on the edge of their seats, no proposal :c. but, i mentioned ""a proposal in this would have been pretty cute"" and he laughed and said ""yeah but you'll like the way i've got it planned much better."". which isn't much news to me, as i've said we've discussed marriage at length (i even have potential venues, the first draft of the guest list we both agree on, etc). all i've gotta do is sit tight and wait for him to do it.  i mentioned having hopes, but not expectations, so i'm not disappointed or letting it taint the happiness. searching for the eggs was very fun!! i needed a couple hints, and to get the giant egg i needed quite a bit of terror inducing help including me getting stuck on the night stand i was using and him having to pick me up off of it :) 

and no, i don't think i missed any eggs or that he's hiding one. i think i really did grab them all, and misplaced one.

now it's time for his turn to egg hunt! i'll put slips of paper in each egg i hide that have different ""prizes"" ranging from things i love about him, to kisses/massages, to more r rated things ;) so, that's all folks. no proposal, but a very happy easter on both ends! thanks for sticking with this tale of mine. keep up all your great advice to everyone that needs it on this sub. and to those of you who seek advice for more serious problems than whether or not to admit to finding an egg; i've been there too. if you go through my posting history you'll actually find that so and i went through a very rough patch on r/justnofamily. it took a lot of work on both sides to rebuild and have the healthy happy relationship we have now!

tldr; boyfriend hid eggs. i found eggs. reddit hoped for a sparkly in one of the eggs, but alas, the only sparklies are the foils covering my mini reese's :) but a proposal *is* somewhere on the horizon!

edit: oh and if anyone is wondering how to propose to their so, easter eggs *are* a cute idea.",8

"tx - my pregnant ex girlfriend is told several lies about me and got me arrested. kid was born and turns out not my kid. she just called me.. ex was a one night stand with no protection. she gets pregnant and we assume its mine. 

things go to shit and we break up. talk of custody and child support comes up and i tell her i was going to try for custody.

three hours later i am picked up for questioning. i refuse to answer any questions, get a lawyer after release and find out i have a restraining order against me. 

the kid is born. dna test is done and its not mine. 

since all of this started i have been recording all phone calls on my cell phone because cya has literally saved my job. 

i just got a phone call from an unknown number. it was my ex. she said since she was using a friends phone and wanted to apologise. i told her we should not be talking. she agreed and apologized for lying to the police about the rape. 

i immediately hung up the phone. i have her on recording admitting to false rape reports to the police. 

will i get in trouble for this? i made no effort to call her and she called me. the call lated 1:28 seconds and i hung up on her. 

second question. what are the chances of using this recording to get restraining order dropped?

third. what are the chances that dallas police will arrest her for the false claim?",2
"if you get a kitten, do use your hands for play so you can teach restraint when they are too rough. restraint is naturally learned in play with hands and littermates because the fun stops when a bite or scratch is too much. adult cats who didn't play this way are more likely to scratch or bite.. obviously this only works if you shout loudly (""oww!"") and stop playing if a bite or scratch is too hard.

i've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. for example, i have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and i can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. but once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

similarly, there was i time i had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. this goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.",9
"- mad at my wife for throwing away pendant from previous marriage. i'm really upset with my wife after what she's done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. so i'm posting here to get an unbiased perspective.

i've been married to my current wife for three years. we dated for 2 years before getting married. before meeting my current wife i had been married to my ""high school sweetheart"" for well over a decade.

my late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. it was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and i didn't start dating again for several years after the fact. i never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

i've always had a momento from my previous marriage. it was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. she gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. before meeting my current wife i would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

when i met my current wife she wasn't comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. so i started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it's an extremely important item to me. for a time she accepted that until recently.

over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she'd bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding i get rid of it. i can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but i had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... why can't she accept it's very important to me?

long story short, when i was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. when i found out i broke down because it was literally the last thing i had to remember my late wife.

 i don't know. maybe i am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. aita?

edit: when i say ex-wife i mean late wife. we never divorced.",3

"bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike. **tl;dr: short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

the recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

she survived, but she easily could have died. *on a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

i myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. the only time i've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. i got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. it really can happen to just about anyone. i got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

and now, with the popularity of parks exploding, i see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. if anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

so: never go unprepared. get a wide-mouth nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

the things i have in mine include:

\- survival heating blanket

\- plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- whistle

\- flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- critical meds and bandages

\- zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- compass (if you're able to use it)

\- paracord

\- knife

\- duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (i always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing i can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - i've experienced this first-hand).

\- iodine tabs for water

\- beef jerky

\- energy gel

**edit:** because it may be of interest: i just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that i don't mention in the list. for reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**edit 2:** i wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. the kit i describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

the kit i mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

for people wanting to see the kit i made, or skeptical it can be done - just google nalgene survival kit. lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than i have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *this kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*",9
"i (26f) am an escort and i am falling in love with one of my clients (39m). if you are going to pass judgment on my profession please dont, if you are going to tell me i am being exploited please don't i am not here for that.

&#x200b;

i took on this client about a year ago. i was immediately struck with how handsome he was. as i got to know him he showed himself to be a kind, sweet, charismatic, utterly brilliant person. he is always gentle i never had to enforce any boundaries with him. over the last year i have come to look forward to visits with him above any of my other clients. if there's a scheduling conflict i will give him the priority, lately i have been more intimate with him then my other clients, cuddles, kissing, hugs, and other things i dont do with my other clients. i love my overnights with him. we have long deep talks about everything we have a lot of shared interests and we just get along really well. i feel very safe with him.

&#x200b;

i am falling in love with him. its never happened to me before. i have always kept emotion separate from my work but i cant help it with him. i will spend time with him i dont bill him for, i spend extra time with him and just love to be with him. i've been spending time with him casually, going on... dates i guess for lack of better word that i'm not billing for either and the lines are starting to become very blurry.  i dont know what to do. i think i want to move the relationship from professional to personal, truth is it's already becoming personal to me, but i cant imagine he would be ok with my work if i was his gf. i am afraid of being rejected by him and ruining our work relationship, i think i would give this up to be with him but that presents a whole new set of problems for me in finding a new career.

&#x200b;

i dont know what to do. do i go for it? risk rejection and ruining our professional relationship? do i give up my career for him if he says yes? i dont think i could continue this if i was with him personally. do i just keep silent and continue our relationship as is? or do i drop him as a client altogether? i was never looking for a guy to ""save me"" but i cant help what i'm feeling for him.

&#x200b;

\*edit\*i know why hes single. his wife died in an accident 3 years ago.

edit2 i cant believe how many responses this post has gotten. i am going for it. i'll tell him this week. now to figure out how. lots had asked if i have a back up i do.

edit 3 i'm about to leave for lunch with him. i'm not going to bring it up yet but i do intend to ask him if he ever sees himself getting married again. thanks for all the support. i didn't expect to see this much support.

edit 4 lunch was nice. we had a good time. i did ask him if he felt like he could ever be married again. he said 3 years ago the answer would be a hard no but now he wasn't so sure. then he asked me if i ever saw myself getting married and i had a similar answer, i told him i asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my place tonight, not work, personal. he said he's like that. i'm going for it.

final update 

well i truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. i didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. i really didn't expect all the support i got. i was flooded with comments, pms and chat requests. some were about what i expected. accusations of gold digger, and ""cant turn a hoe into a housewife"" type comments thats really the response i expected. what i didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. you were all right in that i did know what i really wanted. i did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push i needed to not waste anymore time. shoot your shot right?

&#x200b;

i'd like to address a few things before i get into the update

&#x200b;

a few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. i was pretty sure he wasn't married i did out-calls to his home and my married clients never take me to their home always a hotel. but i was regularly in his home, i saw the pictures of her around the house i know she was real. 

&#x200b;

how can i trust a guy who uses escorts? well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what i do. i cant imagine judging a man for using my service. i was his first too and unless hes a good actor i know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. i never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business. 

&#x200b;

i should wait for him to approach me. unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. as the lines became blurred i did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous i had to drop. i am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. i had to be the one to make this move

&#x200b;

do i want to do this forever/do i really want to give it up? different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. some in favor some against. bottom line is i don't think i see myself doing this into my 30's. it used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets i look forward to anymore are the ones with him. i also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. i heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but i just cant. even if he would be ok with it i just cant. another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what i do. shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

&#x200b;

a lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our ""working"" relationship. i imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so i'll put it here. we have been. for some time now. we meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. we also text throughout the week. 

&#x200b;

ok on to the update. i think i left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. this was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. i posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. he said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. then he followed up with a question about if i would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. and i sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. he had to go back to work by this point and i invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. he has never been to my home. i dont bring clients back there only friends. i hoped that sent a strong signal to him. 

&#x200b;

i went back home and started getting ready, i had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. i called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more ""normal"" i told her about the reddit post and said i was making the jump. i also let her know i wanted to take her up on her offer. i called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. i said something had come up and i wouldn't be available. i'm out. i'm done regardless of what happened with him if i cant get my head in the game anymore and i'm getting too personal, plus now i am realizing i want to be in a relationship and i cant separate sex from my feelings like i thought, its time to call it. this isn't what i want anymore. this choice was for me not him. even if things didn't work out with him i realized i really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. one thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when i told him. i honestly didn't believe he would but i asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. she knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

&#x200b;

i got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. he came by at around 7. he had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. i invited him. he said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. i told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. i dont bring clients to my home. i was really hoping he was getting the hint. dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but i could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. so i put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and ""shoot my shot"" as you all put it. i told him i was dropping him as a client. he looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? what did he do wrong? did something happen. i assured him it want about him. i was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. i told him about the job i took and he wished me good luck, he said i was attractive and charming and he was sure i would do well in sales. he said he was going to miss me. i took a big deep breath and said. ""you dont have to miss me if you dont want to"" and then i spilled it. he was the only client i brought home to tell in person. i laid it all out all the things i mentioned in the post. how i felt about him and how i didnt want to be his escort anymore. i wanted to be his girlfriend. i said i understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now i was asking to stick around and i would understand if he didnt want to continue on. he said who told you that? that he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. he said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. he was still hurt over his wife and that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. he asked me if i was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. i told him i could work with it and that i wasn't trying to replace her. we kissed. i led him into my bedroom and we made love. 

&#x200b;

we spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. he offered to help me make the transition but i told him i wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. i appreciated his offer and if i needed the help i would ask but i need to do try on my own at first. he respected that. i told him that things would change now. as his gf i would have expectations of him i never had as an escort. he was ok with that. i told him i never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now i wanted monogamy i would give it and i wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and i reminded him i dropped my clients. he said that wasn't a problem. i was the only one. he spent the night with me and left this morning.

 

&#x200b;

where is this going to lead us next? i have no idea. maybe i am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was god working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. i'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. my whole life has drastically changed in just a day. i didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it. 

&#x200b;

to everyone who said i was a worthless whore who could never be loved, fuck you too, to everyone who expressed concern thank you, maybe this is a mistake but i have to find out, to everyone who encouraged me to go for it thank you, you were right, without the thousands of responses to go for it i would have languished in that limbo for a lot longer. 

&#x200b;

as a final thought i want to say that this isn't normal. if you see sex workers please dont see think this is the norm and that the women you see may also fall in love with you. while i'm sure it happens and ive heard from others who were in similar positions to mine its really not the norm. if you're considering sex work because you think you can find prince charming know this outcome is very unusual. oh and i hated pretty woman btw. i never thought it would be me one day.

"i'm tired of the racism and heterophobia coming from ""woke"" poc and lgbtq+ communities. i'm a pansexual black/cuban poet who has been doing slam poetry for 5 years. throughout these 5 years i've seen so many people who swore they were ""woke"" proceed to do a poem that isn't much more than hating white people and bashing straight people. at the end of these poems, most poc go insane with applause, and the white people in the room all clap along too, even though they've done nothing but try to be an ally. 

this kind of behavior can be seen on social media too.  a person of color can post anything about white people. they can post anything from a joke that uses white people as the punch line to straight up saying ""i hate white people"" and be fine. same thing with queer people and straight people. 

and i get it. i'm black, cuban, queer, and a woman. i'm made up of two races that have been enslaved, tortured, and shunned. my gender has been put down for centuries. i would've had to force myself into the closet if i was born a couple of centuries earlier. i know what it's like to be hated for who i am. i know what it's like to feel angry for what's been done to my ancestors, and my queer brothers, sisters, and siblings. but i don't compliment these poems. i don't applaud. i don't like these posts. because it's wrong. this is the same kind of ignorant hate being flung by the homophobes and racists on the other end. this is all just tit for tat. 

you're not woke if you:

- make racist/ sexist/ straight bashing jokes and can't take it back in your direction. 

-use generalizations like ""all white people"" or ""all straight people"" but then get mad when someone uses generalizations like ""all black people"" or ""all queer people. 

-refuse to talk or communicate with someone simply because they're a white straight cis man but then feel angry that someone doesn't want to interact with you because you're a queer person of color. 

-push allies away when they're trying to help you. 

-think you're better than anyone because of your identity. 

everyone has the right to be who they want. to be proud of their identity. you have no control over what you are and who you are and you shouldn't be hated and put down for it. but you shouldn't put another person down just to lift yourself up. 

next time you write a status or a poem about the ""other"" side, insert blanks on every time you name them. insert something represents you into the blanks. then read the poem and visualize someone from the ""other"" side reading it back to you. do you feel put down? that's what you're doing to others. 


tldr: love yourself but don't put other people down in the process.

"for telling a friend's girlfriend that she's spoiled?. several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. before we start, some background about my friend: i've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. he worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. he paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. he recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.

on to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. i could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. when we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how ""at 33 years old i shouldn't have to take the bus anymore"", and ""taking public transportation is for losers"". as someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, i'll admit i took some offense to that. i've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it ""beneath me"".

the real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. here's where i may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. 

after a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. after they left, my wife said i shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and i almost ruined dinner for everyone. my friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.

"i (m 31) am growing tired of my wife's (f 31) hangups on sex...... ive been with my wife for about 15 years, if you include the time we dated. we have been married for 11 years in august. 

i love my wife, but the sex just fucking sucks. and it has sucked for the last 5 years or so. every now and then she will get adventurous and try a different position, but its almost always missionary or ""doggy style"". sometimes she gets on top, but its rare.

i constantly tell her how beautiful she is, i tell her how much she means to me, and i try my best to do whatever i can to lay signals that im into her. i hug her, i stand close to her in public, i make it well known that im pretty damn proud to be with her. 

she reciprocates none of it. she never comes on to me unless i straight up ask her to (seriously, ill ask, ""can you do me tonight?"") she doesn't spontaneously get playful (in an adult way), she does not masturbate....^ever. i work long hours, and ill come home and playfully ask if she got adventurous with any of the toys that we have (which are literally collecting dust, btw) and she just snips ""no"" in a fashion like it would be disgusting if she did so. she gets upset if i cum anywhere but inside her or out away from her, as its an inconvenience to be cummed on (one time she got pissed because she had just showered and i came on top of her pussy). she keeps the same positions, same setting (always on our bed, on my side), orgasms and goes to sleep. it fucking sucks. the sexiness factor is zero. i love that fucking woman to death but the intimacy isn't there at all and im not sure i can do it anymore. its like its a chore for her, and not something she looks forward to. 

anywho, it came to head tonight. i asked her if we could, ya know, tonight before bed. she said yes. so the time comes, she was on me and i wasn't totally into it, so i started to get soft. i made up a bullshit excuse, and asked her to just stroke me to get me hard again (oral would be totally out, as i had been inside her, and that is an absolute no go zone for her, so i didn't ask). so she climbs off me and proceeds to take my cock in between her index finger and her thumb and stroke me as she didn't want to touch my dick because it had been inside her. i lost it. i said how depressing it was that she didnt even want to *touch* my dick after it had been inside her. this is supposed to be our sexy time and she is out here acting like everything is icky and im fucking done with it. she has since rolled over and went to bed without saying goodnight.

i cant live like this. there is no adventure, no surprise, and no spontaneity.  im too fucking young to be having old people sex for the next 20 years. this was probably more of a rant than an advice piece, but damn.

"a 32 yo man picked up my 16 yo daughter from school (with her consent, obviously without mine) and they had sex shortly after. do we have any legal recourse? mi. the child is my step daughter. she was picked up from school after a half day while her mother and i were working. after she was picked up, they went to the man's place and had sex (it doesn't matter, but she was a virgin prior to this). 

she was then dropped off near our home and walked in our home before her mother or i were home yet. she met the man via a mobile app days earlier. this all came out today during her counseling appointment (she has ongoing issues with anxiety and a lack of friends/feelings of acceptance).

ignoring the fact i am unbelievably upset with her and will be dealing with that situation separately - do we have any legal recourse against this man?

i believe the age of consent in michigan is 16, but i do not know how that works as far as getting picked up directly from school without permission from parents and if that is allowed. to the best of our knowledge no pictures were exchanged.

fwiw i understand and accept the fact that my step daughter made this decision on her own, and that it is jointly a failure of us as her parents that this happened (read: i do not blame the man for this happening 100% as the step daughter and we as parents should have done better, but i need a place to direct my anger).

"update i 34/m found condom wrappers in our trash can. my wife 34/f and i don't use them and i'm wondering how to approach this.. link to previous thread here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ba2nt4/i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash_can_my/).

opinion on whether i should talk to my wife or not was pretty even and quite divisive at times.  ultimately i decided to talk to her for a few reasons.  she wasn't exhibiting any other suspicious behavior that i could tell.  i know her pretty well and i think i can read her reactions to things well too.  and she's my wife, she's been honest and faithful, as far as i can tell, for the 15 years we've been together.  i owe her the benefit of the doubt.  and finally if she was cheating, she was getting away with it, so maybe bringing this up would shake something loose and i'd figure out what was going on.

i brought it up pretty casually.  just ""hey, i found condom wrappers in the trash can outside, any idea where they came from?""  we discussed it pretty calmly.  she didn't have any idea where they came from and suggested some of the same theories that you guys did and that i had thought of myself.  there was no indication she was lying or hiding anything.  she understood why i was concerned and didn't freak out and accuse me of not trusting her.  

so that's pretty much the end of it i guess.  i don't see any further evidence that she's cheating and i'll chalk it up to one of those weird things that happens sometimes.  i'll probably be on higher alert for odd behavior for awhile, but that's really all i can do.  sorry it's not the fun drama-filled update you were all hoping for.",8

we should be realistic with children from a very young age. say things like, ""you can do so much"", ""the future has so many possibilities for you"", anything else besides the false promise of ""you can be literally anything you want to be""

"can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?. yesterday my phone was stolen at lunch and i chased down the girl who stole it making a scene in the mall. a plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.

the girl tried to say i was trying to steal her phone. i told the officer that i could unlock the phone and the girl could not, i told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. 

he refused to give me the chance or believe me. he told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. 

i left. 

the girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so i decided to check back 2 hours later. i saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. 

when no one was in her store and her back was turned i took my phone back. 

before anyone starts going off on me for it, i know. i know exactly what i did was extremely stupid but i am still paying for that phone so...yeah. 

i am asking for the legalities of it.

the phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. 

the place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that i am on video. my questions are simply did i break any laws?

if the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and i was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did i break the law?

"by buying my mom an amazon device.. i want to start by giving some background here. i basically live, eat, sleep and breath amazon. i need something, straight to amazon. i use kindle and audible daily. want to stream music, amazon music. want a new movie, prime video. run out of something randomly, ""hey alexa......."" laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. so when looking for a place to store photos, i see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with amazon photos"". naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. automatically upload photos from my phone? even better. 

rewind to september 25th, my mom's birthday. i thought about her gift for a while, but when i remembered she didn't have a smart tv, the answer was easy. i hop on amazon shopping and use my amazon credit card to purchase one firetv stick. she was so happy she could watch netflix on her tv now. yay, success! or so i thought. 

yesterday i get an email from amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the fire tv family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did i imagine that it would sign in to my amazon account without even asking for a password. surely she'd have to use her own account. 

fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. sitting in my mother's kitchen, i glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

i spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. i happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. i'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. i took probably 40 pictures that night for my so to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my entire family to view. i have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

nobody helped me. the remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where i'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. i didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, i just ran away. 

the worst part, i asked alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, i'm not sure about that."" fuck amazon.

update: i promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. i talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. however, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

i'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an amazon ad, i just wrote it how i wrote it because i thought it was funny. i wish amazon was paying me for this crap. 

i'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. yes i fucked up, i was a dumbass, that's why i posted it here. yes, i should have known this could happen. call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my so do. it's fun. i don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. it happened.

this time, i turned a corner with my dog and her dogs saw mine, overpowered her (walking both at once. about 60-80lb pitbulls) and even though i picked my dog up, they bit her leg and dragged her down before going for her neck. i screamed for help and eventually people came out to help.   

one bystander said i ""should avoid that area because i know her dogs live there."" and i guess they convinced that owner that it was my fault that her dogs attacked my dog.

edit: sorry for all the edits but i think i need to clarify something. the reason my roommate isn't paying rent is cause her parents hit a tough spot financially last winter, and my dad wanted to ease the burden on them a little. he said he would help out by giving my roommate a place to stay so her parents could just worry about her tuition and not room/board.

i told them ""you might want to cut that out! llamas spit in self-defense."" but they kind of laughed my warning off.

now, i knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. but i decided not to tell them about that. i figured if they persisted, i'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

the llama was being patient. at one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. it got the girl square in the face. she dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that i was in.

to make things worse for them, i didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! it was a slow day, so i just locked the doors. i told them i didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

"by giving my 19 year old puggle the fat off my t-bone steak. this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. 

on mobile so forgive me for my sins. 

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he's been my best friend my whole life cause i'm 22. so he's all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, i was cleaning my t-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. i thought, ""man, buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so i proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. i proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (quickly for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so i didn't expect this, but i suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. i'm watching him eat it cause i'm all stoked he's enjoying himself & feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk irishman.   i instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so i grab the fucker & tug it out. he's unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. i'm freaking the fuck out. so i start giving him cpr. (i don't know how to do cpr for humans, let alone a dog, but i gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day i die. he lays there for a second & i rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug i gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat i ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. i monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. i gave him some love & he went to sleep. 

my life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us.

"update - the current owner wants us to pay for ac unit a year after selling house. this is the update to this post: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9z8ei4/sold_townhouse_a_year_later_ac_goes_out_new_owner/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

i know only a handful of people will read this but i figured why not do an update. 

we were sued via small claims court for half of the amount of the ac unit. the case predictably was dismissed as we didn't misrepresent the condition of the 14 year old unit.  

what was interesting is that he genuinely thought that we owed him the money. almost to the point of self righteousness. the way he talked about us; what he supposedly was told with nothing evidentiary to back up his claims. additionally stating that his lawyer said that his case was strong. his lawyer didn't manage to show up to court but still very strong case. oh well. it's over.

"i swiped right on a girl without a picture, and we matched.. so after a brief chat i went to go pick her up. i wasn't expecting much, probably 300 lbs with bad skin, but hey, i was so desperate it was this or join an incel chatroom. 

i walked up to the door and lo and behold, 5'2"", baby blue eyes, strawberry blonde hair, all the right curves in all the right places.  i couldn't believe my luck. 

i asked her what she did for a living. she said she taught sunday school. now i never had me a christian girl, but i'm open minded so i took her to dinner.

on the way, i lit a joint and asked her if she puffs.

""oh heaven's no, what would i tell my sunday school children.""

i said okay, weed's 50/50 some people do some people don't.  and i took her to the best restaurant i knew. i ordered the steak, she ordered the lobster. i asked for the second most expensive bottle of wine on the menu. when the waitress came to pour, she said she didn't drink.

i said ""you don't drink?!?""

""oh heaven's no, what would i tell my sunday school children.""

excellent food, sparkling conversation but i'm bummed out, i don't know what to do with a girl like this.

so i'm driving her home and pass a cheap motel, i figure, what have i got to lose. so i ask:

 ""wanna get a room and knock boots?""

she says: i thought you'd never ask!

i say: really? what are you gonna tell your sunday school children? 

she says: the same thing i tell them every week. you don't have to drink and do drugs to have a good time!",0

"banned from public unuversity due to false allegations without hearing my side. banned lifted three weeks after person reda ted all charges and admitted to lying. usa, washington. edit: title should say ""redacted"". sorry for the spelling errors. i didn't spell check before posting.

edit2: it was a female. it is a title ix investigation
i did speak to a lawyer for 30 minutes who said i didn't have much to fight for. the ""online"" courses were not online. it meant my normal classes that were lecture based could provide me info vis email. it wasn't a set up online course and 4 of my 5 professors didn't have any way to provide online lecture info. and even so, only one class provided me resources. the dean did not provide any info even after emails from me asking for it.

i was banned from campus following allegations against me. i was accused of sexual misconduct and assault charges. the allegations not only never happened but i have never even met this person for longer than 5 minutes at a party.

i was brought into the dean's office with officers in the room who showed me the charges. i told them i had no idea what they were coming from and i barely know this person. they still issued a no trespassing issue until ""further investigation"".

i was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. i am a senior and about to graduate. they reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. they only gave me info for one class. then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. and another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. despite this i am still ""under investigation"".

i missed too much class to reasonably still complete. three full weeks of missed senior level classes. i had to drop out due to this condition.

i was also let go at my prestigious internship because they only hire full time students. 

because of this i have no school and no job.

the university refused any refund to me upon request and their response was ""the actions were necessary due to the severity of the accusation"" despite never hearing my side.

"instagram is ruining everything (a rant). i think that instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. let me explain:

1. **ig is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. while social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. no political or important dialogue is happening. i would argue that even pinterest is more worthwile since at least diys teach you something.
2. **ig is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** why we are all pretty much aware from our own instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **ig is bad for your mental health.** because unrealistic standards are set on instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in ig. this also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (see also this article: http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/(http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). i also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **ig makes people vain.** taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. it's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. this makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **ig gives the worst incentives to people.** the reason i am ranting right now is that i saw a vice video about a poppy field in california that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for instagram (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxurr-cigka)). they then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". so these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. this shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. now i don't think that they are inherently bad people but i think that instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

i would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: a lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. so just to clarify, i do think that one can use instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. what i wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. and while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives i feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. i do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. however, i feel that while some good instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",6

17 years ago i passed my driver's test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. being a huge nerd i checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when i found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. i just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. i handed it to him, said i didn't care who it belonged to but if i ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren't going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn't hers. he just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, ""it's your mom's for her glaucoma"". whatever, fine, just don't keep it in the car anymore.

i was at a family a dinner awhile ago and i can't remember what someone said but i replied with, ""yeah, because mom has glaucoma"" and my mom goes, ""i don't have glaucoma"" and i, incredulously, said ""dad said you had glaucoma"", in which my dad responds to with, ""what the hell are you talking about, i never said that"". after reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn't believe i believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. i told them i had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit i'd been on for the past like 15 years. they just laughed harder.

"update i allowed my sister to move in with me, dad tried to say i kidnapped her to avoid child support (ct to ny). update of my previous post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i\_allowed\_my\_17\_year\_old\_sister\_to\_move\_in\_with/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/)

&#x200b;

tldr: i didn't get in trouble for taking in my little sister and a court order for child support was issued.

&#x200b;

so, i had my day in court today for the child support hearing. dad actually showed up for court instead of using the option of conference call like my mother did. my sister (let's call her valerie) wanted to sit in the courtroom in case the judge had any questions for her in particular (he didn't, but i'm proud of how brave my sister is for going to court when she didn't have to) because i could feel my heart beating in my throat the entire time. 

the judge started out by saying he was unsure if a support order could be issued today given that valerie is now 18 and in ct would be ineligible but in ny would be eligible until 21 but then began asking some some questions.

dad did a lot of talking at first, mostly saying how he had a court order that gave him full custody of valerie and that mom was supposed to be paying him child support.  then he said how valerie dropped out of high school and left the state to live with me without telling him or getting his permission and how he didn't know for a month after the fact. he complained that mom never speaks to him about anything, that i make no effort to have a relationship with him and that valerie doesn't either. boo-hoo, we're all ganging up on him and he doesn't know what he did to deserve it, etc.  sure enough, as a few of you kind folks mentioned, the judge asked him ""why didn't you know where she was for a month if she was supposed to be in your custody?"" 

he then says that she was staying with her mother at the time but that she would've had a place with him and still does have a place with him if she had asked. at that point, sick of hearing him play the victim, i piped up and asked as calmly as i could manage ""why didn't she have a place with you 9 years ago when you dropped her off at mom's house, didn't tell her you weren't coming back for her and then got rid of all her belongings?"" 

my mother on the phone confirmed what happened and said that she asked me if i could take in my sister because of my brother's violent behavior early in 2017. valerie was 17 at the time she moved to nys and is still attending high school to earn her diploma (better late than never) and i've been her sole source of support ever since. 

the judge then reviewed the guidelines for monetary support. my mother, being disabled and on social security, was to pay no more than $50 per month for support. dad was to pay no more than 17% of his income, which translated to to roughly $800 per month. the judge asked me what amount i was looking for. my answer was that i just wanted some help with the groceries and her medical bills so i asked for a total of $250 from dad and the max $50 from mom. dad tried to haggle me down to $200 per month because he just bought a house last year (you should've seen the look on the judge's face). the judge reminded him that the guidelines recommended $800 a month and i held firm on $250. dad sighed and said he'll have to give up smoking to afford it (this is supposed to make me feel bad?). 

the judge made the order for support, effective until age 21 and i never did get in trouble for allegedly ""kidnapping"" my little sister.

thank you to everyone here that gave me encouragement to see this through and not fall for dad's intimidation tactics.

hey guys. first of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

so, long story short, 3 days ago i ""broke up"" with her for good.

now, you guys might not agree with the way i did it, but i did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. even though i am sad and disappointed, at the same time i understand she wanted to see other options and i respect she didn't outright cheat on me. that being said, i am also not a backup plan and i deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

i didn't see her anymore and i finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""hey \name\, first of all, i don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. i took some days to think about it and i realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and i would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. i understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. i respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. i wanted to thank you for all those years and i wanted to apologize for any wrongs i did to you. i want you to know that i am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. i hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. goodbye, op""

the message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but i realized i am already getting over it and that i no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. she replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. so, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, i am almost certain that i would accept her back. so yeah, until next time.",8

"subaru service center gave my car to someone else. final update

so i dropped my subaru wrx off to be serviced at a third party service center.  they called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when i arrived today i waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  they offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  should i take any action against them/is there any action i can take against them. 

<edit: i need to clarify a mistake i made earlier when posting this, they are not an official subaru service center as i previously thought.  they are just a third party service center, i have and do not want any hate going out towards subaru, they did nothing.  this was not their fault and i love their cars/company.  i will be posting a final update later tonight about how everything is ending.  thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

edit:

thank you all for all of the advice.  im not good with legal stuff and if i had not posted here i probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  i called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while i called the cops.  i still have not seen it but i was told the damage was extensive and that i would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  at this point im going to get a lawyer involved right? i shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  even if they offer to cover fixing it im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  they if i didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but im really not having that.  not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

final update:
hey guys i just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  i did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  little backstory, when i first bought the car in november the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  that is what i was getting fixed.  that being said, in the end i will be getting a new 2019 wrx, i am pressing charges against the sm for theft, i have filed official complaints with the motor vehicle dealer board and the office of the attorney general consumer protection section, and i will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  luckily my lawyer was pro bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  all in all i am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  without this thread i would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  for everyone dm'ing me and asking about what the location is, i am not at liberty now nor will i be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  it is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  thanks again everyone!

"alcohol is overrated and drinking in general is not that fun.. i personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me i personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. i never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am i missing something ?

and before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends i doubt that since i have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. hes probably part of the reason i dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

im trying not to come off as someone saying im holier than thou, this is just something i couldn't understand why its as popular as it is.

edit: umm tbh not quite sure where to start, but i guess thanks for the rewards its very much appreciated!(although i have no idea what they mean still very much appreciated!!) this post blew up wayyy more then i expected since i think i mentioned in the comments im relatively new to redit and made the account several months ago although barely used it until recently and never got more then 20-30 upvotes or likes on any other social media platform (expected this post to do about the same as any of my other if im being honest) so this was definitely a surprise... as i have been very well informed in a lot of comments this isn't actually that unpopular. i was basing my opinion of the country i live in as its has an extremely big drinking culture or atleast in the communitys i've life's and always just thought of it as the norm. i actually just wanted to say thanks to the people that was really nice and gave really interesting comment, rewards and making probably one of my first interactions with the community a really pleasant one, so to all those people a big thank you!!",6

"my dog keeps getting attacked by an emotional support dog in our apartment.. \wisconsin\ there is an 8 month old male german shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. i have a six month old australian shepherd. we live on the fifth floor and the gs lives about four doors down. we run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

he has attacked my as in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. he attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the gs was hostile. the worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. when we walked inside the gs was off his lease and immediately started attacking my as. the owner did not immediately intervene. i got down to try to get between the gs and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. after about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the gs off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. i took pictures after the event. i had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my as's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

i first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. they said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. i spoke with the owner of the gs after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their gs just for on the grounds. the attacks have happened so often that i do not think they can easily control their dog. my as is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from gs's if he sees them in public.

after seeing the gs and the owner for about a week after these events, i kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. i spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. she said that the 8 month old gs is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. i suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. she said she is not comfortable with that.

i do not know the logistic of esd's but i do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. what should i do in this situation? i feel that if i go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume esd's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).

&#x200b;

**edit:** this post got a lot of responses and i'm so thankful for it. i read all your comments. unfortunately the post was locked before i even got off work so i didn't get to reply to all.

stemming from the advice i got i contacted the apartment again via email so that i'd have a paper trail, i explained that she said she would not muzzle him due to him ""being a esd"". i also provided links to local government sites stating that esd's are not the same as service dogs, and directly asked that they intervene at this point. i am awaiting their response.

i also called the local department of neighborhood services. i filed my case, she said they will assign someone to it who will contact me and begin the investigation into it.

in lieu of this, i then contacted the pet store where the worst attack occurred. the owner was very supportive on the idea of starting a case against them. she remembered the incident and said that i had made a purchase afterwards, so she looked up my name and found the exact time we were in the store. she said she will trim the cctv footage into a clip and email it to me.

so now i will have footage of the attack in the store, a picture of the resulting marks on my arm as well as my dogs bloody paw, and the email exchange with the apartment. i feel pretty ready to get this started now.

thank you to everyone who came here to help. i really had no idea where to go with this. i'd just like to say that my goal is not to have their dog euthanized. i blame the owners completely for this. i'm sure with the proper training he would not be so uncontrollable. my goal is for the gs to be muzzled while he is in public, and hopefully to be removed and given to responsible owners if possible. thanks for everyone's care and advice!

"as a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: ""5 lamb chops, please."". as a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: ""5 lamb chops, please.""
amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop.
he follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and
trot across the road to a bus-stop.
the dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.
when a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.
the butcher follows, dumbstruck.
as the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.
after awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell,
then the butcher follows him off.
the dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.
he goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door.
he does this again and again. no answer.
so he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,
jumps off, and waits at the front door.
a big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.
the butcher runs up and screams at the guy: ""what the hell are you doing?
this dog's a genius!""
the owner responds, ""genius, my ass.........
it's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!""",0
"judging people by their looks works well for the vast majority of cases.. so here's the thing: looks are not something that just randomly fell into place or whatever, but they are to a large part the result of choices and efforts made. for example, if you are well kept and wear a professional outfit, you're probably someone that cares a lot about impressions and your career, and most likely you have a fairly conservative outlook on life. equally, if you look like a stoner or like you don't care about your looks, then that also says something about your values and beliefs. there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's just obvious. if you are a woman, cut your hair short, and dye it three different colors, it's also not too hard to guess your political leanings. same for someone running around in polo shirts and boat shoes only.

in the vast majority of cases, going by the initial impression leads to fairly good results. no, looks don't mean everything, and yes, i am aware of the halo effect, but really this ""don't judge a book by its cover!"" nonsense needs to stop.",6
"in a lot of children's shows like peppa pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids. like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. the girls save the day. i don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. like there's barbie movies too in which barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. a lot of kids shows are like this. the father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

in peppa pig, specifically, the father of peppa is an engineer. he has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. it's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. meanwhile ""mommy pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. the whole thing is pretty insidious.

from an early age it sends a message of girls being empowered, but how about the little boys? like sure there's still superhero movies but those are aimed at a little older audience, plus all those superheroes are usually genetically mutated in some way and unrealistically handsome, so few kids would identify with them.",6

"by accidentally dosing myself with lsd at work.. throwaway.  well it was around noon when i ate my pasta.  shortly after that i found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  i initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee i shouldn't have had.  at 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which i always use for some gym time.  as i was walking out of the office i realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  the possibility that i was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  somehow.  life finds a way.  saturday morning i had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent tupperware lid as the backdrop. some of the residue must have lived through the night.  on sunday i made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the tupperware.  i put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  today i ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  or maybe i laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  i'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since i microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. it did though and by the time i had walked to the gym i knew damn well what was coming my way.   well anyway, i went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  the work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, i started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when i didn't know where i was going, or why.  i pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before i had to take the plunge.  i did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  i cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. my behavior was normal except for when i forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  we had a new team-member start today and i had to give her a tour.   i don't think she could tell i was fucked up but i know i was sweating a lot and rambling.  i now have another 50 minutes before i very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  what a fucking monday.

tl;dr: accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending i was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office.",4

"by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp. technically yesterday and not today, but yifu sounds like some odd anime genre so...

so it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. i was dropping her off at about 8ish and i was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. for the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

anyway, stopped at the summer camp. my daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. i signed my daughter in and then i.... just drove off. in my defense, well, i got nothing. honestly, i just forgot the dog there.

so my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. i now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). she also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. she got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. all in all, could have gone worse.

edit - i get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  sorry, but no can do.  pics include other people's kids and i'm not going to post that.  also, i think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and i've said way too much shit i regret on reddit for that to happen.  just use your imaginations.  she's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  she's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

edit 2 - for those asking.  yes, camp called me.  twice.  and left vm's both times.  number was not one i recognized so i didn't pick up or check vm (i know, tifu!  number is now programmed in).  both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if i could come pick the dog up.  i clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  and yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  huge huge props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

edit 3 - for those asking.  i did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  so i left them an awesome review on yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

edit 4 - yah, i get it.  this could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  yes, it was a mistake on my side.  that's why i'm posting it here and not on r/todayiwasawesome

edit 5 - holy crap.  came back to see this hit the front page and my inbox has 500 messages.  i just want to take a moment and say thank you to my mom and dad for having sex with each other and making this moment possible.  

tl;dr - dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. dog had a great time and i think she's now a camp counselor.",4

"i think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. he is a doctor.. this is in north texas. 

hey so i must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. i started typing it up in word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

i think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. i know this is going to be hard to explain, but i have been having gaps in memory that i have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  i was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then i started to notice that this seems to happen when i go on dates with him. 

i know it must be crazy, but i have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  i know its him as… well i wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

the first time it happened was when we were drinking and i wrote it off as too much to drink. we get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. but then there were a few times when i know we were not drinking. 

i decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. i had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time i talked with him. i remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. my car and his car was in the parking lot too so i was confused. 

i decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

after 3 days at his place i remembered everything so i was started to trust him again. knowing he was an ent i know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. i was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said i should be treating those sores. 

i had completely forgotten they were there. these little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. i got so freaked out he mentioned them that i decided to leave. 

the next day he came over to ""check on me"" and i remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. i never agreed to me with him and would never want to. he does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something i have no memory of. 

i am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

this has started to affect my work life as well as i start to get paranoid when i see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. i get paranoid that they are about to fire me. my friends also state i have been acting strangely and out of character. i have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when i do.  

is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? i do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so i want to be damn sure when i go to the police.

"minnesota: landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. what now?. for some background i am renting an apartment and my lease ends on september 30th. my landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. i do have a lease that says i get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which i believe is the law itself, but in this case i did not get that notice.

last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8am saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). he asked if i could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing i'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

i did not see these messages until i took lunch at 12. i texted my landlord back saying i thought i am supposed to get notice for entry and i'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though i'm sure that doesn't legally count).

long story short they robbed me and i have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. they took everything of value such as laptop and tv and even some stupid things like my lamps.

my renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and i should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. he met them at dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. i told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place i would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

what now? push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? i would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",2

the same thing happened a second time the day after i posted that, so i went along with the suggestion of filming myself while i sleep, and did that starting just over a week ago whenever i napped during the day/evening.

long story short it clearly is my brother, i've got him doing it on film twice and thats without even filming myself at night. i have no idea how to even start to talk to him about this, or if i should just stay quiet and try to sleep less until we're back to separate bedrooms.

i'm still getting comments and private messages asking a lot of the same stuff, so - i'm 14, he's 13. as for why i 'let him do it a second time', well i do still have to sleep, and i kept recording myself until i made this post and people pointed out why it might be such a bad idea. also a lot of people asking how i know what semen smells like. how do you think? calm down and stop calling me names.",8

"by missing every sign on a date. so didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. i invited a close friend to the movies with me. a few odd things happened, and it wasn't until i spoke to a friend of mine that i realized i missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) beforehand, i jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and i got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). she replies ""don't worry, if that were you and i, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. i laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. i replied, ""i guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. she then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in my car though"". i then replied ""you know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) when we get back to her house, she asks if i want to go inside to get a soda, to which i politely declined because i wasn't thirsty.

tldr: i missed strong signs that she was dtf

"by masturbating too hard which led to having surgery. obligatory this didn't happen today but when i was in the 8th grade.

8th grade was about the first time i discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (whatever year they show the ""birds and the bees"" movie at school) well, needless to say, i was all for it. i think i did it just about everyday after school. and i was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.

one day in particular though, i wanted to see how fast i could do the deed. so after school i ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. i counted down from three and went full speed. let's just say i was a little too rough with my ding\-ding.

after i beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times i had ""spatooshed"". i just assumed i over\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so i laid down on my bed to take a nap. the tightness never went away so i had a hard time falling asleep. the tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.

i was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. i told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (i failed to mention that my dangly bits hurt a little bit too) so my dad, being the classic mexican dad that he is, just said ""just drink this 7up and take some tums and you'll be fine in no time."" unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says ""thats it, i can't take it anymore. we're going to the hospital.""

oh. my. lanta. talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  i thought i was going to pass out from the pain. this was my new worst pain of my life.

we eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. i tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won't go away. i didn't tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th grade me was too embarrassed and didn't want people looking at my dingle\-dangle. so they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn't you know it, they don't find anything. at this point it's been 2\-3 hours since i got there so i say screw it and i finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum ""hey mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda."" right away she yells why didn't you say something?! then she calls a nurse to take a look.

the nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then manhandles my beanbags! for those who don't know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. so this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! i scream in pain. now, i would never hit a woman in my life but i would be lying if told you i didn't raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. haha. remember when i said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.

the surgery was quick and i didn't have a lot of pain afterwards. they went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn't turn again. i just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then i was back to ""normal"". well, because righty decided to take a left turn at albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. this means righty shrunk. like a lot. lets just say lefty towers over the little guy now. could be worst though. the doctor said 30 more minutes and i would've lost him.

i ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. rob and big, dr. evil and mini me, pinky and the brain are some of my favorites. lol.

lesson to be learned here: some things are meant to be taken slow.

tl;dr  wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.

"by putting a rock in my ear, then leaving it for roughly 13 years.. bit of context; i was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. i'm 26 now. 

well it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and i had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. it's where i got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?

while i sat amongst rubble and dirt, i had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.

again, i wasn't bright. 

well. i drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.

that said, i flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly i can't remove it. not a single adult was even aware i was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.

so when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.

i lost my mind.

my dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. whatever really.

either way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that i was overreacting.

okay. sure.

let's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and i'm in highschool.

this is where the real fun begins. equalbrium (equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. i could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. was a nightmare, really.

i get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that ""imaginary rock"" i had long ago forgotten.

all i hear is scrapes.

scrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.

i'll admit, i immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. that's another topic entirely.

well wouldn't you know, though? the doctor said i was faking, examined my ear, and said i just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. right. it was probably june at the time.

my mom didn't really believe him, but i decided ""balls to it. let's get some hydro-perox!"", because fuck hospitals really.

skip along the years a bit more, i'm 18 and i know for a fact there is something in-my-fucking-head. i'm losing it. so i hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, ""there's definitely blockage. i'm not sure if it's a rock, but i can certainly try to help.""

so this professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of scissor-hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. it was audio torture, hands down. rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.

the end results? ""you'll need to see a specialist"", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.

i'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.

the sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and i began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when i reflect back.

let's time jump one last time. i'm 22, couple months away from 23, i have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. great.

but now, out of the blue, i'm losing hand-eye coordination. well damn, you know? i attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.

i lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that i could dig this chunk of earth out myself.

three different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. but that last one was phased from the situation immediately.

this was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and i locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.

eventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. in an instant i froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.

jackpot.

now, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.
the pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like i was passing a kidney stone from my skull.

all in all, 2/10. wouldn't do again.

but now it's totally out and i have it put away in a ziplock bag.

i had no real recovery issues i guess. as soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. now it just rings occasionally.

my balance won't ever be the same i feel, but it's fine enough as is. otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, i have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and i get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.

not a bad trade out.

**_edit_**: for everyone calling me an idiot, trust me i know. for everyone concerned about my follow through, it was 3 years ago and i've been to the hospital between then and now for basic check-ups and have mentioned the stoned-ear before. it's fine. this is why i can laugh it off.

**_another edit_**: 9yrs old at the beginning, 22 at the removal. had to check a few timestamps.

i'm currently 26.

also, spelling

&nbsp;

tldr: i put a rock in my ear at 9yrs old, went to two doctors, one didn't believe me, the other couldn't help. pulled it out myself after 13 years when i was 22 and now i can't swim underwater, storm cells give me minor headaches, and i have poor balance.",4

"update. my parents joined a new age cult and tried to drag me to a compound against my will.. since my last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ccd4vh/fl_my_parents_have_joined_some_new_age_religion/) got popular and people still seem interested in my situation i thought i would give you guys a update on everything. it's been over a month and i'm sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn't the best idea to rant about it online till i felt ready. well, now that i'm settled down a bit i feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says i should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though i know the group now i won't be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).

&#x200b;

so after i stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. my dad said not to go so i somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and i would come home that night. this plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. it didn't take long before my mom caught on that i was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  my mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because i had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. my friends parents called the police and i called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. i'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.

&#x200b;

my mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. in the end my dad made it so i would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. i stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. my mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: my step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month i was coming no matter what. 

&#x200b;

after a week of this, everything changed. my mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. my sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. during this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  after this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200b;

she proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". all to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand i was being used by evil.""during these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn i was."" according to her i am a ""evil seed"" and that i not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". i also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. she told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. she ended by telling me that i was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". the last contact i know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

&#x200b;

at the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. i moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. things are still pretty raw right now and i really don't feel like getting into the emotions i feel towards this. but i feel like at least updating this may be a start. thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. i really do appreciate it :)",2

"for being mad my girlfriend took my keys?. my lovely girlfriend and i have been together for 8 months. she slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

my issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student id to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

i asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my id on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. i told her that i didn't appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. we started to fight about it and i ended up asking her to leave.

since then, she hasn't answered any of my texts or calls. when i told my roommate about this he said that i was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and i yelled at her about it. i think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. aita?

edit: i thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, i get that she was being nice but why couldn't she have asked??

edit 2: and no she still hasn't responded to me

edit: i'm at work now obsessing but i know that i screwed up. i had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess i'm projecting or something. and no, my girlfriend hasn't responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money i tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it's early in my time zone

final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. i brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. we had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  she chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

also, i am already in therapy but thanks for suggesting it",3

"my (20f) boyfriend (21m) wouldn't pay for my meal when i forgot my wallet. basically the title. 

usually on dates, we split the bill. i don't really care like in the past, i've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. like we'd go back and forth. 

my current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. from the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. i was fine with it, i didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. paying on a date is sweet to me and i like it but i have my own job so it's whatever. i figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

anyway i didn't really have any problem with it. but we went out to some random spot. like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. so he went down the line and he got his own meal. i ordered mine and then when i went into my bag, i realized i forgot my wallet at my house. i told him that i forgot it by accident and i thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

i was just like what the fuck..? this guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and i paid him back through cashapp. after we ate, i lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city.

"by going jogging - i'm bloody and afraid to go this route again.. unlike most posts, this happened just half an hour ago. 

i'm a 21 year-old male. i was out running my 2 miles. headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. i round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and i see this big black duck looking at me. as i get closer, i think to myself, ""man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?"" i keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. so i stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. this bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.

i'm thinking to myself, ""what the fuck?"" so i'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and i keep running think he will leave me alone. i start running again and the faster i run, the faster he chases me. i start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. i'm thinking, ""i've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, i don't need this shit"" so i stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. in all my years of being a person, i've never trained for this.

this little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. he starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as i'm trying to run backwards away from him. we've covered a quarter mile at this point. i try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. i'm thinking, ""how the fuck am i gonna explain this if i have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? i'm a grown ass man. this is bullshit.""

i try running again and he keeps flying after me. i'm at a loss. i don't know what to do at this point. i'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. am i really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? like, i don't want to, but i might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? seriously?"" we have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. he bites me again and i drop my phone. i pick it up quickly. who do i call? i've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. while i'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, i hear a noise; someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.

this was a big mistake. the duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. i saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. i feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. the last i saw of him was the look i took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake i did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.

i cannot make this shit up. i would have recorded it, and i tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.

this is bullshit. i'm covered in cuts and bites. most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something i was not ready for.

tl;dr i'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. i'm covered in blood.

we had a trip planned for this upcoming week to go to spain and i was going to ask her to marry me - she was well aware this was going to happen. she always told me there was nothing she wanted more. 
she tells me she was drunk and it ""just happened"". 
i'm so hurt right now. she's said how sorry she is many times, and i believe her, but i feel so betrayed. 
we've had a great relationship up to this point, i've loved every minute of it. to add to it she tells me before that how she confided in him that she was scared of spending the rest of her life with someone and how she was unsure about our relationship. 
this hurts me to my core to think that someone i wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. out of all the women i've ever dated she was the one i was least worried about this happening with. 
she tells me that it was the biggest mistake she's ever made and how she regrets it, i just don't know if i can move on. 
we live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult. 
i just don't know what to do. i still love her to pieces  but idk if i can get past this.

my husband and i are looking to upgrade homes given we're planning on expanding our family, so we've been looking at a few open houses recently. about a week ago we were at an open house when our daughter (4) wandered off and picked up this mask type thing laying out on a table. super bright, very loud, apparently very fragile and pretty much right out in the open. when i saw her touching it i told her to put it down but it was too late and somehow it had gotten cracked down the middle. now, i'm not sure if it was already broken and they had left it out as some sort of trap (because who leaves something bright like that lying around during an open house, with children walking around?), or if she did anything, but i felt extremely embarrassed and grabbed my daughter and told my husband it was time to leave.

a so called friend of mine who knows the house owner saw me there and apparently told her she saw me rushing out of her house on the same day she returned to find the mask broken. now she's hitting me up on the phone demanding i pay her back for breaking ""art"" and naming an absolutely ludicrous price (think four figures). i'm absolutely not going to pay her that, but a few people i know think i'm in the wrong here. i personally think if you're having an open house that children will be visiting you don't leave expensive breakables out in the open. i also do not believe for a second that thing was worth thousands of dollars, and if it was, i think there's a very good chance she broke it herself then left it lying around to pin it on someone else and guilt some money out of them. whose the asshole here?",3

"for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?. hi all. 

i gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter charlotte. 

my cousin alice and her parents were among the guests. the first thing i'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. she's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. she doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. she is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

it was alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly charlotte vomited on her. alice handed charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. i went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. my mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

today i got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

i have said no. at the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. she took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. i feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

he isn't a bad guy, i'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. he tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. i think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

he's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. they aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~.

"for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?. i (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. my boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. he gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. i'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

however, there's one girl in our class, let's call her victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. she goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. i know this is the case, because i've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

i've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. she was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him i was there too.

victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. i snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. you're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

she looked super embarrassed and walked away, and i later heard she'd gone home crying. i feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. aita?

edit: since this has blown up beyond anything i could have expected, i feel the need to address a couple of things. there are about 1000 of you screaming ""just make it from scratch!"" and y'all are missing the point. whether you love it or hate it, box cake mix is a thing, and they're extremely popular. millions of people use them all the time. they use them because they're easy, inexpensive, and accessible. there are 8 billion people on this planet and not everyone knows how to bake. not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. and that's ok. but for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point. all i did was mention a couple of easy things to improve on that that people might not know *because maybe no one had told them before now.* some of y'all are getting awful snobby about cheap cake and it's not a good look. 

second, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda. and you know what? that's fantastic! if you have something that makes baking easier or makes a cake that you think is delicious, then do it! you bake that cake! baking should be enjoyable, and if it's delicious then why does it matter how you get there? everyone has to start somewhere so play around with it, experiment, learn what you like, and what works for you. have fun with it. it's just cake.",9

"found cash in my walls. it's mine right? can i deposit them in the bank & pay back my student loans? (washington). update: it is deposited and my student loans are paid back!. my question(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72wjbw/found_cash_in_my_walls_its_mine_right_can_i/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i watched the vhs tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. that's why he kept his savings in cash. he didn't even trust a safe deposit box. that's why they were kept in his walls. and it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. i found the other $20,000.

i went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. she talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

i scheduled an appointment with the bank. when i told them it's for a cash deposit they told me i don't need an appointment for that but i told them it's for a large deposit. they still said no appointment is necessary, but then i said it's a very large deposit. so they booked the appointment. everything went smoothly at the bank. they made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. money was in my account a few hours later.

i made payments and my student loans and car loan are both paid off and i now have a larger emergency fund.

"mylife.com has a profile on me with identifying information. their website falsely claims i have a criminal record. isn't that technically libel?. long story short, i googled myself and saw the first result was a link to a webpage for a company called mylife.

it's a little jarring to see that a company i've never even heard of has a profile on me with my pictures, my hometown, political party, and phone number. it's a little more disturbing to see them falsely claiming that i have a criminal record, which is the first result for anybody who googles my name.

it's not that big of a deal, but they seem to have this ""alert"" on everyone's profile saying that ""\insert name\ does have arrest or criminal records.""

i know anybody with more than two brain cells would realize that this website is a scam, but out of general curiousity, i was wondering if this would technically be considered libel, considering my record is perfectly clean save for a single traffic ticket for an expired registration sticker.

"update my (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22m) tried to spike my drink.. this is the link to my original post:

after reading everyone's advice and telling my boyfriend, we went to the police station. we spent most of the night there.  i told them about what i saw and that he wouldn't let me go easily when i wanted to leave. they asked me lots of questions: if i am sure, what the glass looked like, what the pill looked like,  how drunk i was, how drunk he was, if i had ever liked him etc. it was very uncomfortable but they had to get all the information.

the police suggested that they take my report to have a file ready but said they can't arrest him or go to his place or check anything as it's too late. they did say it would be a good idea to try to message him and get information from him that would be proof of what he did, screenshots and all. i am not sure if i can do that, he has sent me a message asking how i was that i showed my boyfriend but i haven't answered him yet. i am guessing he's going to start thinking something is up since he has texted my bf who hasn't answered him either.

after coming back from the police, we just decided to get some rest and talk about this today. we haven't yet, we were both exhausted and there was a lot of crying on my part. so that's it for now. i don't want to have to talk to him or face him but i will have to anyway. this is all just so confusing, but thank you all for your support and advice.

edit: i just want to give some more information after reading all the comments:

\-i didn't feel the police was victim blaming, i am sorry if i made it seem that way, but they did explain they had to get as much information as needed and i did tell them everything: there is no history between me and s, we became friends through my bf and common interests and i showed them messages between us, they are mostly about when we're meeting with others and music exchanged. they talked to my bf too and they didn't try to say i made it up in anyway and seemed to believe me. i am in a big city in europe, i guess they are used to dealing with cases like that. the officer who talked to us was very nice and said we reacted very well to this, advising my bf that turning it physical would not be a good idea and even telling me i could come directly to him if i felt threatened by s.

\-i am not makng this up, i have read comments suggesting i did and it honestly hurts. i am not crazy and i never wanted things to get this messed up. this guy was my friend, as are the others in the group.

\-my bf and i aren't telling s we went to the police. i gave my boyfriend my phone to text him as me if he wants but i can't do it. i also showed him the posts on here so he can have everyone's opinions on the situation.

i am sorry to seem this pathetic but it is not the easiest thing mentally. and i am so grateful for the support, i wouldn't have told my bf and let alone the police without it.",8

"for singling someone out at a comedy show?. i do stand up. i also have a day job, because, you know, survival. 

i mentioned at work that i couldn't do any shifts after 4:00 on saturday because i had a show. my coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

i had no problem helping him out and i knew this club wouldn't care if i slid a couple people in. but i've been trying to get more bookings at this place and it's kind of a level up from the sort of places i usually get to perform at so i told them, you know, ""please make a point to laugh.""

i'm up there doing my show and i see them and they're the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren't laughing. it bugs me a little but i didn't want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. then i see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. 

so i start telling a joke about a time i gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as i'm doing it i'm slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes i'm talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn't notice or look up until i'm literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

it killed, so that was the good part. but when i showed up to work i was expecting an apology from him. instead he was expecting an apology from me for (i'm quoting here) ""inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke"" ""making him look like a fool in front of his girl"" and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

he basically summarized it as ""you're supposed to be a professional and if you couldn't handle me texting you shouldn't be in show business.""

i think, without question, that he's the asshole. but he doesn't believe me and the only people i could tell this story to and ask to confirm i'm not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased. 

who's the asshole?

"by letting my wife into the bathroom while i was taking a shower. so we had just finished having a wholesome breakfast of eggs, potatoes and cinnabread my wife made and i hopped into the shower. when i shower i listen to a bluetooth speaker, mostly youtube. midway through my shower my wife unlocked the door and busted in claiming she had to pee. i'm a private person and always shower with the door locked, but obviously she isn't. after she finished she asked to come into the shower, but i was in the midst of shaving my legs (yes i'm a guy, i just don't like body hair) and told her no because i had a razor in my hand and our shower is a tiny two shoulder's width stall. she said fine and walked away. shortly after her departure my audio goes out, and i hear the sound of a cat meowing angirly into a microphone blare out of my speaker. this is followed by a series of animal noises and a slew of additional videos including such gems as ""top 3 minecraft songs"" and ""3 hours of farting."" sure enough, she'd stolen my phone. i got out of the shower when she started blasting victory royal fanfare and when she saw me she started dabbing furiously and ran away. this behavior continued for at least ten more minutes before i was finally able to get my phone back.

edit: first time using reddit, color me impressed. i did not expect this to get nearly the attention that it did and thanks very much to the lovely people who gave me the silvers and the gold! this is not an isolated incident, if my wife finds that i've left my phone unattended while she suspects my headphones are in she will steal it and my music will be instantly cut off and replaced. her go-to video is '3 hours of farting' and her stated goal is to one day have me make it through the entire video in this manner. i am extremely aware that she is an absolute gem of a woman and i'm very grateful to have her in my life, thanks to those of you who've pointed that out. for those of you 
asking, shower sex was not an option. our shower is smaller than the tiny shower stalls you'd find in the changing rooms at your local beach. we've done shower sex before, it's a miserable experience, shampoo bottles falling all over your ankles, would choose a bed every time.

"i'm a guy and i wish i could be pregnant. i think pregnancy is wonderful. i know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and i helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. i know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. i wish i could do it, though.


my wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (i really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


she loved being pregnant. every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. i kissed her belly hundreds of times. and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her. her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


the hardest part about it is that i'll never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter. women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. and i don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. i know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant i'd consider it. i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant.


every guy i've ever told has either looked at me like i'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. women i've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. she knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. any guys out there agree with me?


edit: some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. i do not disagree. however, i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy. just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. as i stated above, i am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

"by putting a thong that was not my wife's in her underwear drawer. this happened 2 days ago. so last week i found a thong on the floor in my living room. smelt it like the animal i am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.

2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.

huh... i found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? it was clean so i put it in your drawer. what it's not yours?

angrily, she answers it's not hers. you just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?

i tell her what the hell am i suppose to say. she goes back upstairs really angry at me.

so last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. i send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. it is. we're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... we came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

now the real fuck up. my wife is in the bed. i go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. just texted her and the thong is hers. the only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

you want me to believe that?! that makes no sense

jesus christ, i don't even believe my explanation myself. i tell her to believe what she wants, i don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that i don't have anything to redeem myself. i take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

the next morning she calls me. she tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that i'd put it in her drawer. and if i was cheating on her, i'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

"by ruining a movie shoot with jennifer aniston. disclaimer: this should be, ""several years ago ifu,"" but i'm a reddit n00b and wanted to share one of the most awkward series of events i've ever caused.

i had plans to meet up with some friends in atlantic city for the weekend. i got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the taj mahal. i had been there once before, but didn't really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.

i parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. on my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. he let a bunch of people in and, of course, i squeezed through as he was closing it off.

that is where things went sideways. i saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, ""huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if i'll be in it?"" but before i could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. a second later, someone yells, ""action!""

i start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, ""i'm not suposed to be here, am i?"" he immediately shook his head no.

so, i see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two 'extras' are about to get on it. i think to myself, ""if i can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they're doing in the lobby."" 

i make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. success! i didn't screw anything up!

after a few more steps, i catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. and they're blocking the full width, and not walking! i mean, come on!

only at this point, do i see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. then someone yells ""cut!"", and the two people in front of me turn around. 

turns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were jennnifer aniston and gerard butler, and i completely blew up their scene. there was nothing i could do.. i just said, ""uh, i'm sorry."" i figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.

tl;dr. i somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation.",4

a friendly officer went to his house and got my couch back, as well as a few other stolen outdoor furniture pieces (one was a bench from a local restaurant, i don't know the other situations.)

"by performing the ""major tom"" technique and now i think i'm going to be disowned. if you aren't familiar with the ""major tom"", it's because it's a thing i (hopefully) came up with. it's a form of ""auto-erotic asphyxiation"" by using gravity.

basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. this part is called ""getting in the shuttle.""

as you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. this is considered ""take off.""

if performed correctly, you should become very lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. this is called ""being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

this is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **i, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. you see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. no oxygen = no consciousness.

when i ""took off"" i fucking jumped up at mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. because the next thing i know i was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

before i could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if i was okay. she heard my re-entry. this part is called ""disappointing your mother.""

you can just imagine the scene she walked into.

she stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. i stared back with what i thought was confidence like i was buzz aldrin and just got back from the moon. but thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while i was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (at least not to my knowledge.)

she ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more judge judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. i cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and i managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

i'm currently writing this in my room right now, and i don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until i can think of what to say to her. if there is anything to say at all.

**tl;dr: tried a new experimental masturbatory technique, ended up passing out, mom caught me with my pants down, and now i'm stuck in my room. planet earth is blue and there's nothing i can do.**

"wife asking me to get circumcised - advice?. hi guys!

my wife and i have been married 2 years, 4 together total.

i grew up in europe and circumcision is extremely rare there. apparently it is much more common in the us.

all her past bf were circumcised and she says she prefers it that way.

she stopped giving my oral sex once we got married and she says it's because she doesn't like doing it for me because of how i am not snipped.

she also calls it anteater penis and makes increasingly disgusted faces when we have sex.

i am willing to do this in order to make her happy but i just want to know you're all thoughts about this.

back in november 2018 i was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. it was the most humiliating thing i've ever experienced. i later learned at the police station that i was being charged with multiple felonies. this came as a huge surprise. luckily i was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. for $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, i was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. however it cost me everything and i was unable to pay my bond. this resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. at a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and i ended up having all my charges dismissed. when i finally got out i learned that i had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. his mother is a heroine addict and i haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. they wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200b;

since my release, i've learned that i can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that i was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. i've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. they took down my info but never followed up. so what i did was create a website sharing my story. i also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. literally the only reason why i was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. if the detective had done his job, he could have verified that i wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. this is what pisses me off the most. my life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200b;

i'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. i live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. my web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. i received a cease and desist letter recently, which i showed to my attorney. he said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything i had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. yesterday i received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. he apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" they then talked to me about my website and asked if i could remove it. i said i would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200b;

after the visit i received, i'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. i don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. my friends think i'm being spiteful and have suggested that i just delete it. for keeping my website up?

"the real ""alpha"" males tend to be respectful and chill people. it's the guys with insecurities and problems trying to be ""alpha"" who are assholes.. growing up, i was in a position where i was always going through some sort of adversity whether it be family, school, illness, ect. and there were days where i wasn't putting my 100% game face and attitufe outside the house. 

i notice that my acquaintances and friends who tend to be very accomplished people, and are the epitome of the successful man tended to be some of the realest and most genuine people around me. for example the traits they shared would be: athletic accomplishments in sports, lifting, strong career and academic goals, involvement in clubs and student activities (both in hs and college), traveling, open mindedness, self created good appearance (due to taking care of self and clothing), and humble/positive personalities. i've had lab mates who went to oxford and harvard who i wouldn't have even suspected gone to such schools, because when you talk to them,  they wanted to know about you and really laid back people. you know they're awesome people from just the way they carry themselves.

i had former friends and acquaintances who were the opposite. for example one example of a former close i had was somebody who barely got through high school and participated in nothing back then. after, he would be extremely stubborn about getting a job, going to a job training program, or putting himself in positions to meet new people, ect. his ass was just sitting around broke and always creating drama with other people, while mooching off others. he did not work out much, yet bragged constantly about his childhood accomplishments, claiming to have played 10 different sports. he always talked about being alpha and tried to act like the top dog around others. people initially are drawn to his charm and good social skills, but over time they see the truth that he's just a total loser. in the neighborhood i grew up with there were a lot of people like the one guy i described above.

"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to last vegas in january, only to be unfaithful and carry on an affair with a family friend (37m).. this has been a whirlwind of events. i am in shock writing about it and need an outlet to express whats happened.

my gf and i have had an amazing relationship and always wanted a future and family together. this all changed and i no longer know the person i once loved. full disclosure: i have never suspected my girlfriend was capable of something like this. she has had the wool over everyones eyes.

in 2018, myself, my gf and her mother planned a weekend trip together to las vegas for her moms friends 60th birthday. plane tickets were bought, accommodation arranged, and a whole weekend of events was planned from jan 11 – 14. what could go wrong.

come christmas time, said friend (60f) from las vegas flew up to our hometown (where she is from), with her extended family to celebrate christmas in canada. she has a son (37m). over christmas eve, christmas day, and boxing day, we hung out at this families air bnb house in our hometown and i got to know them very well. i consider myself to be very observant, and i noticed zero interaction between the son (37m) and my girlfriend (24f). after christmas, the family flew back to las vegas and awaited our arrival for the january weekend.

here is where i should have clued in, which i partially did, just not to the extent that would have helped. about a week before las vegas, my girlfriend informed me that the boyfriends of couples who were supposed to fly down to las vegas had bailed out on the trip, and slowly the trip was turning into a 'girls trip.' my girlfriend never outright expressed to me she didn't want me going, but did her best to ensure me i wouldn't have fun there. 3 days before we leave, my girlfriend outright tells me i cannot come; accommodations have been rearranged and i'm no longer invited on the trip. given that i had paid for this trip, i was visibly upset. i expressed that i didn't feel as if this was a partnered decision but rather her trying to intentionally exclude me from something i was invited to. ultimately, she left the decision up to me. i decided it didn't feel right at this point to go unless i was convinced she wanted me there, which i wasn't. friday came and went, she flew with her mom, i stayed home.

my girlfriend ended up losing her passport down there. (the lie detector test determined that was a lie.) she stayed a few days extra and flew back. she met up with me the following friday and told me she no longer is happy in our relationship and wants to break things off, hoping that we will get back together in the future. i protested, but understood from our current spat that something wasn't right and that we should go our separate ways. maybe one day we would get back together.

this leads us all to today. for the last month, my ex girlfriend and i have been communicating on and off (phone and texting) but have never seen each other. she has been extremely busy preparing for her teaching practicum (so i thought). she and i would both initiate conversation, and discuss our relationship and talk about working things out in the future. she and i both told each other we had no interest in seeing other people. on valentines day, she even messaged me saying how we should be together and she misses me.

after struggling to move on with my life i decided today was the day i would head over to her parents house (where she lives) and express my feelings and ask if this could be worked out once and for all. by pure coincidence (because nobody else was home at the time) and the kindness of a step-father, the truth was revealed to me.

i called her house and asked her step-dad respectfully if he'd allow me to come to the door and speak with my ex. him and i got along great and he said i'm always welcome to come and talk but unfortunately, she is not there and neither is her mother. she is in banff during her 'busy practicum weekend'. her step-father sat me down and began with this: ""i'm assuming you're here because you don't know everything. if you knew everything, i don't think you'd be here. i have been told by gf, gf mom, and other family members not to tell you anything, but i have a lot of respect for you. my ex-wife of 10 years cheated on me and i know how it feels. anything you ask me, i will answer completely honestly.""

confused, i sat down where everything had been explained to me. my girlfriend had begun an affair in las vegas with the son (37f) of her moms best friend. every weekend since, he has been flying my ex-gf down to las vegas to meet him and this past weekend took her to banff with the whole family. keep in mind, he is divorced, and has 2 kids (8 and 10). i am absolutely disgusted and feel sick about what really happened. i don't even know how this happened.

i cannot thank this man enough for telling me the truth which nobody felt the need to pass onto me. i feel betrayed, deceived, heartbroken, and angry. suffice to say, i am in an absolute state of shock.

i simply texted her saying ""i know everything, never contact me again,"" and my phone has been blowing up ever since. her demanding to know who told me, her denying what has happened, her being angry with me.

i'm completely lost reddit. i thought i was going to marry this girl one day. how does someone change in the blink of an eye. i learned more about my girlfriend in 30 mins than i did over the course of 3.5 years.

where do i go from here? advice very much welcome.

update: thanks for all the comments everyone. i've read them all and they do show the upsides to this garbage situation. since this shit storm began, my ex returned from her trip and figured out within a few hours who spilled the beans. just to clarify: the step-dad assured me on my way out that he would be crucified for this and had accepted his fate. her house got turned upside down like the circus it is and i've been being blamed for it all. i haven't responded to text/calls from my ex, her mother, or their house. after denying what had taken place, i just assume at this point it will be more lies. she has every reason to lie about it. whereas, the step-dad had every reason not to lie. thanks again everyone for the support and advice. the succubus has been phone blocked and on all social media.

 one particular day i dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that i had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. so as we arrive i mention this to the rider:

me - hey i just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

rider- no, must be the wrong house

me- nope, he walked right out of that side door. i dropped him off at *names local bar* his girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (i had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) you guys having a family/friend vacation?

rider- this is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. nobody lives here but me and my wife and i've been in ny for work for the past 4 days.

we drive around 30 mins to this park, listened to a bit of music on the way, still getting to know each other a bit and everything was going fine. 

i parked, we got out of the car and walked a bit, still chatting, nothing deep, but the usual what you do for work, hobbies etc etc.

i had to take a leak, so i go to the bathroom and when i walked out, i noticed she was talking to a guy and he was being very flirty and when i walked up to them, he asked who i was and she responded: ""oh he's just my friend hahaha"" and he said he wanted to grab her number to go out for a drink sometime. she was all too happy to give him the number and they hug with a kiss on the cheek before he leaves.

"for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?. i'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. i mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. she embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. personally, i have nothing against this at all. i am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. however, i do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. i don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

however, despite being a ""supporter,"" anna regularly comments on my body type. for example, i always bring food for my shifts since i personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). anna will often say things like, ""you should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""you look skinnier than last week. i told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" she'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if i was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that i look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" one time i was changing into my work shirt in the back and anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" i have no idea what that even means but i doubt it was a compliment.

these hypocritical comments have pissed me off. i enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and i enjoy working out and staying toned. anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. i don't think this is healthy. 

finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy i kinda like came in to get some food and i was super excited to see him. he turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. oh well. anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""maybe he's into curvier girls."" i basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. i asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. then i told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (i called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

she called me insecure and told me i was being a rude bitch. it was reaching the end of our shift so i clocked out early and left so i didn't have to argue with her more. i was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. she said that i was right and all but that i was insensitive in the way i brought it up and suggested that i apologize. i'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",3

""oh, it's just a statue,"" she replied nonchalantly. ""the smiths bought one for their bedroom. i liked it so much, i got one for us too."" 

no more was said about the statue, not even later that night when they went to sleep.

"i (36m) think my wife of 8 years (31f) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42m). throw away for obvious reasons.

so my wife and i have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  at first it's good and we start communicating better.  

about three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". alone.

around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

she starts telling her friends about ""danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which i think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""dr. soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""danny"".  (i don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and i were intimate.

there have been a couple of other weird coincidences that i thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  she went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  it was about 9;30 at night and that seemed really odd to me.

about a half hour later i tracked her iphone and the location showed up as his office.

when she came home 3 hours later, i asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

i think i'm going to confront them in the session this thursday.",8
"by falling asleep in the back of my boyfriend's car. last summer. we're on a road trip from new mexico to mexico. we have a honda element converted for living in, so i crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. he stops at a gas station in the desert of arizona and while he's pumping, i get out to use the bathroom. come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. i jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. i sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. i reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.

i go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. obviously they do, but whatever. so i start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think i'll steal it i guess. i go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. i realize i don't know my boyfriends number by heart so i just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. he doesn't. i use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when i call.

i resort to explaining to everyone whose phone i ask to use my situation. some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and i was just being modest. it's been about 2 hours now. the store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, i'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

a cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. i explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. she tells me i can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. i ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. we're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. i just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. and there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

he said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized i wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. and that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. he thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

edit: i understand ifu by not relaying my need to pee.
also that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. also have never heard of this last man on earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. i have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened irl.

"update, for despising my mentally handicap sister?. i'm back like i said i would be,. my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

well, since that day i made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. the week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

i started by telling my grandpa the story of why i broke down the way i did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. no one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. my grandpa told me some things that i don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this i was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. with everything else i told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. he pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when i sat down with them. it didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. this included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

suffice to say, this week has been rough. but, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. my grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things i want to do. my aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

well, saturday night i sat down with parents to talk. it went badly to say the least. they came clean to me about everything. they told me things i will not repeat here. but they did not apologize. my parents still claim that i some how owed my sister my time. my father even saying ""you were put here to be her caretaker"". i won't lie and say i was composed. after everything i learned i confronted them. on the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. the money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. they denied it or made excuses. and in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

today will be my last time talking to them for a while. after talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, i'm not going back. later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. when i graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. my aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. my parents have called me twice since saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when i was coming home.

i won't be going back to them. right now i still feel pretty uneasy about everything but i feel like that will pass. the rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. but in the end i lost my parents. over all of this, i've learned something that i wished i saw earlier. i don't hat my sister. in fact i love her with all my heart. i should never have never projected my hate onto her. that was wrong, and someday i hope to make up for it. but for now i need to leave.

so, there's my update. thanks again for the support my original post got. i really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. thanks you.

we just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. every thing i wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. i have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record i could think of. my parents were quiet the whole time i was there. shorty after i arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. it took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. i hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. even now i sit here and think if she really meant it. after this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. i hope she meant it. right now though, i think i just need to look ahead. maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. i hope so.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice and love. it's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience i at least got some positive out of this mess. will i come back? i don't know. if something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. but for now i'm going to move on. for all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and i hope to see you on the other side. see you space cowboy's :)",3

"by shaving my butthole before a first date.. edit1: technically ""trimmed"" not ""shaved""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

so the happened last night, but this requires some background explanation...

this is gonna be tmi, but that's kinda the nature of tifu, so whatever. i'm a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. i also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and i don't know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (aka the taco bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it ain't fun. so i had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. so i trimmed it off at night, added some aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. win-win!

fast forward two days, and i'm going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she's like the best looking girl i've dated, so i wanna shell out the monies of course. dinner went pretty well, and we got coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren't home) for a movie. turns out they aren't home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.

but, guys, i can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  we're sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and i just had to let one out. i'm usually pretty good at silent farts, so i'm not paying attention to the fact that we're in a quiet spot in the movie. and this fart was not silent! it was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart i've ever had in my entire life, hands down. i was mortified. she immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and i of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. she did not laugh with me...no text-backs so far.

i googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. so a little there for you inside this tifu. just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so i can go on dates again.

&#x200b;

edit2: man i shouldve used my real account for the awards! guess i'll have to switch over to this baby.

tl;dr - i shaved my butthole to make wiping easier and prevent rashes. turns out it makes your farts super loud, which i discovered during a movie in my apartment on a date, which ended awkwardly and soon after.",4
"if you make your husband/boyfriend sleep on the couch because you're pissed at them (and you share the same bed) i'm gonna assume you're a bitch. short of them cheating on you or something similar that is a huge breach of your relationship, no one has the right to force someone else out of their own bed. it's just as much theirs as it is yours. if you're too pissed at them to sleep in the same bed then that's on you and you should go to the couch.

this goes for guys too, but i've never heard a guy say he's gonna make his wife sleep on the couch because he's upset with her. i've heard it multiple times from women both in real life and on tv.

edit: i really appreciate everyone's concern, but i'm fortunately not posting from the couch. the issue was between two friends in a relationship and my wife and i both thought it was terrible.

also, from reading the comments i think i was wrong about it usually being women who kick the dude out. it seems like there are just as many bitch dudes who try to pull this and you women deserve better.",6

"my 33 m wife 32 f hit me at a family bbq. everybody laughed.. i don't think i'd ever felt more pathetic than i did at that moment. we'd gotten into an argument. she wanted me to drive to the store to get a certain kind of ice cream for all the kids there (including our own). i'd already had a few drinks and was feeling a bit tipsy. i didn't think i should drive. my sister was also urging me to go. she was standing right there when my wife hit me. it was square across the face. i'd just told her there was no way i was driving since i'd been drinking and that if she wanted the kids to have icecream to go get it herself. my wife called me an asshole... then wham...

my sister looked a little shocked at first and then just laughed. everyone around us laughed. maybe some of it was awkward laughter, but i can't say for certain. nevertheless i felt humiliated.

the thing is that was far from the first time my wife has hit me. it started a year or two after we were married (we married at 25). it was infrequent at first. she was always super apologetic. over time it escalated. she started throwing and smashing things. screaming. berating me. hitting, kicking, and punching me. i don't even know how it got so bad. it just is and i feel trapped. who in their right minds would believe me? who would ever think she was capable of this? sometimes i feel like i'm hallucinating it all and i'm just losing my mind. she was once such a wonderful woman and mother, and now? i don't even know.

now people do know and it doesn't even matter. it's funny. i'm funny. it's so fucking funny. look at him getting hit by his wife. so damn funny.

i want to disappear. i would if it weren't for my kids.

i don't even know what my question is. i don't really have one.

is even possible to come back from this? i wish i could reverse time and pause it when we were happy.

"for withholding from my children that my husband had a wife and child before he met me? they've just found out and are acting like i've betrayed them.. my children are 17 and 14 respectively, and i'm hoping the fact that they're teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. 

my husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. no one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. 

i had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. it was at an aa meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the us. 

i have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. i like to joke that i'm keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. i've had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- i am so damaged that i just feel lucky that i got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. 

we had two children- two sons. we'd never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it's a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. 
he has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. 

my mother in law told the kids this sunday gone, as she decided it was 'time for them to know'. she didn't consult us before telling them, and certainly didn't do it in our presence. 

since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they've been prodding their dad asking why we'd never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they're acting like we've kept a secret affair family from them or something. 

my 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. i broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing i'd ever heard him say. i asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. 

he told me that it made 'so much sense' why we were abnormal, why we don't drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. 

the two are pretty heartbroken, and i feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children's lives as a result of us staying quiet. i am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and i don't know how to proceed. i have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.",3

as soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. she told us how she didn't want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. we explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

fast forward: our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad.

the bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it like this(https://i.imgur.com/llijq5v.jpg). i was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. he squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

while he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. he couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as i screamed and jumped off him.  the bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

i now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. we sobered up real quick, i fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

my oldest son is in the marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  he took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  at first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. when it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  i tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



i get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  he gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his dress blues.  now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



we discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  we go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  we settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... free internet points and all that......



i walk in and the house is quiet.  no one in the living room.  a little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



what i did not know was the entire time i was gone, my wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  she got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



so no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to surprise her.  a handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  the text told my son to stay outside.  i had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



so my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  i told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  the look of confusion on her face was priceless.  it took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, there was our son in his dress uniform and she was estatic.  the noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  it goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess will have to suffice instead.




tl;dr  didn't tell wife that marine son was coming home, missed out on sexy times and the second half of the packers/falcons game



edit 1: goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.

update: wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  she is worried that this story will end up in one of her marine moms fb groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.    son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.

"my 36m wife 34f has been having an affair with her own brother and i realised our son might not even be mine.. i dont know how or where to begin. this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

​

my wife and her brother has always been messing around, they were the type of siblings to take joking a bit too far (sexually). new people who meet with them have always said that they are the type of siblings who you would think are married if it wasnt for them being brother and sister.

​

my brother in law lives very close to us. he is divorced and has 2 daughters who live with his ex-wife. my own wife very often takes over our son to his place, and also very often visits him herself. this is something i never ever had anything against, after all they are brother and sister. it wasnt until recently when my 4 year old son told me mommy and uncle tommy (lets call him that) had been kissing on the lips that i got suspicious. apparently my wife had gotten angry at our son for no apparent reason for having seen this and she had told him grownups do this as a gesture of love.

​

now, i understand hugging or kissing a sibling on the cheek but in my 36 years on this earth i dont recall kissing my own sister mouth to mouth. that is just...disgusting to me. tonight i did something which i never done or felt the need to do before, and i checked my wifes phone only to find a load ton of messages between her and her own brother. most of it is just regular chat, nothing special. but after having scrolled through a ton of messages i find sections of intimate pictures between them, and even messages such as ""horny"", ""want to come over for a quicky"" and similar sentences. i am grossed out by the sheer imagination of my wife having had sex with her own brother, as this cause me to imagine ever having kissed any of my own sisters which is disturbing to say the least.

​

having sit here now thinking about what to do i cant do anything but to think my own son might not even be my own. so many times have i heard how ""he looks like uncle tommy"" and just looking at his face makes me believe this even more.

​

i am really at a loss at this point, i have no doubts about what she has done, but i cant imagine also having lost the only thing that meant more to me than my own life, my own blood, my son.

​

i feel like just jumping off a building or taking my own life if he ends up not being my child.

​

i want to divorce her, but i dont know how to go on about finding out whether i am the father or not, i really dont know what to do if i found out my son wasnt mine.

​

edit: after reading several comments i decided it is best to not confront her now. my wife has been asking me multiple times what is wrong and i just told her i am not feeling well. i can barely look her in the eyes at this point. the only reason i am keeping it together is for my son. i wanted to go and sleep at a hotel but it would just raise too many questions on her part, so i will sit infront of the tv and sleep on the couch.

​

edit 2: had no idea this post would spiral out and get this many responses, thanks i guess. i wont be reading more pm's, i have gotten way too many of them.

currently staying with my sister, i decided it was not a good time to confront my wife yesterday, so i just told her i will be moving in to stay with my sister for a few days as she needed help with some stuff. my sister lives about 30 minutes away from us. i have told everything to my sister and she thought it was best to meet with a lawyer. we scheduled a meeting today, he will be helping me with the divorce and has also offered to help me get a paternity test (read some comment about a guy who did a paternity and got the wrong result) which is why i will get it via a court.

i will be getting a divorce for sure, this is not something i will ever accept or can forgive. it's beyond f\*\*\*ed up. to the feminists out there who messaged me and told me to step up and forgive her, f\*\*\* you too.

i will confront her but i cant tell when, probably tomorrow. my sister wants to come with me, but i wont let her, i will head over there by myself and let her know what i found out, will see where it goes from there...

"the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action tx. when i was 14, i was raped by a close family friend. i got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when i was 15. i knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but i did not know their names or what they were like. we received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. i do not remember signing anything.  i do not know what happened to the friend; i asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. my mother said he was jailed but i don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. i  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. my husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

&#x200b;

a month ago, i received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. i believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. she told me that she wanted to get to know me. i spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. i found myself disgusted by her. there are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. she is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. i decided that i would not be comfortable meeting her. i blocked her without responding. after a week, i began to receive letters from her. four letters in total. i did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. i finally answered. i told her that i was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or i would get the police involved.

&#x200b;

she  began to berate me. she told me  that my family was her family. she accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that i had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that i had held back important information. without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  she told me that she would be making contact with my family whether i liked it or not. she also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if i did not comply and that i could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. when i began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. if i agreed to pay for a round of ivf, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. here are my questions:

&#x200b;

1. does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if i tell her to stay away?
2. could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. my parents are dead and i do not know how to find out information about the adoption. i did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. i am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. could i be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. i have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. could i form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if i agreed to pay?

edit: amount asked for was removed. also, because several people have asked: i do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. it only stopped once i left the state. i am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and i will need to move again.

"if we should blame anyone for the lack of action on climate change, it should be greenpeace.. because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

because of their crusade on gmos, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

and because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a unesco heritage site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against ddt.

they personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. they have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. they are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

edit #1: a slight correction on the ddt point. it was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. it was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. however, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that ddt is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

"should i (24m) leave my gf (24f) over her weight?. hi, before you start thinking im shallow hear me out. ive been with my gf for about a year and she is the kindest person ive ever met and i love her to bits. she is perfect in every way except one.

&#x200b;

she has gained alot of weight and is now obese. i have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and i know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.

&#x200b;

it doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, i have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. lets go for a run, same thing. have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. i  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, i found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. she also lies about what she eats.

&#x200b;

theres an excuse for everything. when i think of my future, i think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. when i think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because i dont have much hope that she will change.

&#x200b;

you can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. when she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now i dont even recognise her. if you have any advice or comments i will be super grateful, thankyou

&#x200b;

edit: i went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. im glad people understand where im coming from. i thought most people will be angry that i dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which i just have to say you are dillusional!.

i am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, i wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. i feel like the word therapist scares some people. also whenever i see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. alot of people mentioned sports too, i could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. i wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind i will give her 5 months to get into a reasonable shape. if i dont see any improvment then i know there is no hope and will leave her. thanks again you lovely people, i will be reading the comments still :)

&#x200b;

another edit: i cannot reply to all your comments but i have read most of them! some of your stories have been great to read. a quick update i decided to book her a therapy session for a few weeks time and told her about it. she took it really well. to all the people who are asking how much weight she gained, i dont know because she would never tell me her weight. i really hope this relationship survives because i litrally love her with all my heart but i shall know in a few months. i will make an updated post then if anyone is intrested too.",8

"by walking in on my teenaged son masterbating.. this just happened and i am still wishing it didn't.   my  15 year old son and i are home, i'm working on a puzzle and making dinner, he is playing fortnite.   he disappears for a little while and i go to find him.    i didn't really need him for anything, just wanted to say 'hi' since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.

i start walking down the hallway towards his room—our house isn't super big and i knew he was in there.   the lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but i could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.

i decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   he was lying with his back to me, i could tell by where his phone was.   as i am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, i see it.   my son's boner.   as i was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   it all happened so fast and i was already airborne before i realized what was happening.   i did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son's boner through his boxer briefs.   

the entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, i'm sure.   i have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, and i don't want to.

at that point, i am still flopped down on his bed.   both of us are well aware that i just saw him whacking off.    both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   i say, 'dinner is almost ready.'   (it wasn't)
he said, 'ok, i'll be out in a minute.'
i said, 'no hurry.'

now i'm standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he'll need if he ever finds out i posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering why don't boys close the door when they are masturbating?  

tl/dr:   basically the title.     

edit: spelling.   dammit, i can't change the spelling of 'masturbating' in the title.   oh well.   i fixed 'fortnite' though.   

edit 2:  for those asking:

—i am mom.
—i want to be clear, i have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   i am a nurse.   i talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   the horrifying part is that i walked in on him.   that was not ideal.  for either one of us.  
—his door was open.  
—i have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before i walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   
—he isn't on any social media.   i am quite confident that his identity is protected.

edit 3:   for anyone still interested...

shorty after i ate some of my soup i couldn't breath and was breaking out in hives. i woke up in the hospital on christmas day. (my mom called an ambulance when she saw my face was swelling). my cousin didn't say sorry when i started breaking out in hives. he started laughing and told me what he had done.

"for denying water to a group of women who were supposedly dehydrated as they refused to pay?. a very popular hiking trail actually crosses my (privately owned) land that is nestled inside a national park. i've never objected to people crossing our land as i'm an avid hiker and don't want to deny them enjoying the scenery, though it can get annoying at times when groups of 10+ people litter on my part of the trail.

anyway, a few years ago my daughter decided to set up a small stop to sell cold drinks and snacks on the trail. it's basically a caravan she lives in, but with an attached section to serve drinks and food. so she'll spend her time in there and every now and then people will pass by and happily top up (it's a multi day hike). 

it made a surprisingly large amount of money, and so we began taking turns spending time in the caravan on the off chance someone (or a hiking group) passes by.

now, we live in a place that gets very humid in summer. it ""feels like"" 40-45 degrees celsius during june-july. today i was watching a movie in said caravan when a group of 5 girls rung the bell. they said they were out of water and asked if i could refill their water bottles. i told them i could for 50cents a bottle. the reason we charge money is that all of our water is rainwater and hence limited (especially in summer). we aren't connected to an endless supply of water.

they were furious that i refused to top them up for free and said they are dehydrating and could faint from heat stroke. i told them where a clean creek was about 1hr down the trail that they could top up (i've drunk from there countless times, seriously no risk) but they refused and insisted i top them up. 

they had a young girl with them (around 13) while the rest were in their early 20s. so i refilled the young girl's bottle and gave her a sprite for free, but insisted the adult women with her pay. they refused and very angrily went on their way. my wife says i should have filled them up, but imo so long as the little girl is okay i don't think they deserved anything given their attitude.",3
"update: ex-wife has custody and wants me to allow her new husband to adopt our son. do i have to do this?. https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5cku3a/tx_wife_has_custody_and_wants_me_to_allow_her_new/

thanks for the help!

she ended up taking me to court. her lawyer focused a lot on my criminal record (which had happened before i even met her, and she married me knowing it). her lawyer claimed otherwise, that i had hidden my record from her and she only learned about it after our marriage. this was very easy for me and my lawyer to disprove as i had email communications with her acknowledging my record. she insisted the emails not being in her inbox is proof that the emails are made up. perhaps she seriously thought deleting the emails from her account would delete them from mine too. her own lawyer looked really upset after this. 

she dropped the case immediately after that hearing.

her own husband apologized to me, said he wouldn't have agreed come forward for adoption if he knew the truth. he was a decent guy. ex lied to him about me to get him to adopt my son. it's been a couple of months since then and according to my son they're now separated.

i'm talking to my lawyer to change the custody agreement too.  ",2
"for telling my girlfriend her hate for babies is pathetic and doesn't make her cool or edgy?. i (18m) have been dating my gf (19) for about four months. we met on instagram, i followed her for a while and she has a real grunge/edgy aestehtic going on. i thought she was super hot and cool, and when we started going out she was basically also a really edgy person. she makes the occasional cringey edgelord comment about hating people and how life was sooooo much better in the 80s (when she wasn't even alive), which cringes me out but whatever, it's manageable. 

however, she also has an immense hate for kids and babies. whenever kids get near her she gives them dirty looks and moves away or groans. she has a four year old sister, and she won't even sit on the same sofa as her, giving excuses like ""she's dirty"", ""kids are all feral"" and so on, just ridiculous shit you say when you're 13 and in your emo phase, not 19. 

recently, she came to a family party at my parent's house and long story short, she ended up alone in a room with my sister (who is a new mom and is only 16) and, because of her social anxiety she was 'too afraid of seeming rude' to say no, but she ended up holding my sister's baby while she was in the middle of changing a diaper. as soon as my sister leaves the room to grab a new diaper, my girlfriend put the baby down on the couch, getting shit on the couch and shouting for someone to come take care of the 'gremlin'. 

this really annoyed me, i get that she doesn't like kids and that she doesn't want to be near them, but she doesn't have to be so rude and obnoxious about it. if she didn't want to hold the baby, she should have said no or got someone else. she just seems to think that kids should instinctively know to keep away from her. i just don't get how she expects to go through life never having to deal with children at all. 

also at the party, she moved away from my five year old cousin when he sat next to her to eat some cake, and when asked to pass the baby's blanket to my sister, she pinched it with two fingers and flicked it over.

on the way home, i told her it's ridiculous she acts this way and she basically said something along the lines of ""kids are disgusting, they're entitled and dumb can't see the world for what it really is"". i told her not everything has to fit her stupid edgy narrative, and she thinks i'm an asshole.

"if your girlfriend refuses to do something sexually with you that she has willingly done for her previous boyfriend/s, you should break up with her.. for the record, i'm not talking about things she tried once with an ex, but never did again because she genuinely didn't like it (although, an argument could be made for her letting you try at least once, too).

what i am talking about is any act she willingly performed for an ex that she either enjoyed or was at least indifferent to (i.e. she had no negative feelings about it).

&#x200b;

there are two main reasons for this behavior and neither of them are good.

&#x200b;

the first reason could be that her ex is more important to her than you. he is so important that even though the relationship is over, there are still things that she wants to reserve as only being for him and, in her mind, giving those things to you would feel like cheating. i know, crazy right?

&#x200b;

the second reason could be that she is less attracted to you than she was to her ex. you are second best in her estimation; good enough to date, but not good enough to give all that she has to offer. does that sound like a desirable relationship to be in???

&#x200b;

now, reddit is filled with easily triggered women and the whitest of knights who have this magical ability to read things that were never typed, so let's make some thing's clear:

&#x200b;

1. no guy is entitled to sex from a girl just because she is his girlfriend, but no girl is entitled to a relationship with a guy she won't fuck.
2. i'm not saying that a guy should say ""do this for me, or i'm leaving."" i'm saying that, once he finds out that she's holding out on him sexually, he should move on. that relationship is toxic, and you can be sure that sex isn't the only thing she's keeping from him.
3. this obviously goes both ways and pertains to more things than just sex, i only picked men and sex because i tend to hear about that situation more often.
4. obviously not suggesting that the girl should be forced to do anything she doesn't want to do.
5. if both the guy and the girl are refusing to give each other things that they willingly gave their ex's, then i guess it's a match made in heaven.

&#x200b;

this post was inspired by myself and a group of guys talking about our past relationships and the commonalities we noticed with each other.

for me, it was a girl in high school who refused to kiss me (we did everything else but no kissing), but admitted to me that she'd kissed her ex a lot. i dumped her. girls i've been with since haven't held back like that (at least not that i was aware of.)

another guy had an ex that wouldn't do anal, but she talked about doing it with an ex and how much she liked it.

another guy wasn't getting blowjobs, but found out from a mutual friend that his girlfriend loved giving them to an ex.

there are more, but they're all pretty much the same story.",6
"new york- mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while i was babysitting 4 year old step sister. hi folks

i'm a 21 year old college student. my parents separated soon after i was born, and my my mom raised me alone until i was 15. she met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister eliza. she's grown up with me, and i often baby sit for her for short periods of time. i live with a roomate in apartments owned by the college

late last week, my stepfather's mom died. he's polish, so my mom and he left for poland leaving me to babysit eliza for a week. yesterday, i got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in poland. i've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

i have no idea what to do. my biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. my mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the usa that i am aware of. i'm studying political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but i have no job and no salary. 

eliza has no family other than me that i can turn to. i'm not ready to take of a child, but i also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and i've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. but we also look very different- my dad is jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. so i'm a tall, mixed race dude while eliza is a small blonde girl (i bring this up because i was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

so what do i do? i'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and i haven't even told eliza yet. it just hit me that we're now alone, and i now have to step up to the plate and take care of eliza. i have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

edit: thank you for all you advice. i apologize if i do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

edit 2: thank you to everybody who has offered to send me financial support. however, i am currently ok, and my mom's friends, and my college friends have kindly offered to help me out, and i also have a little bit saved up. but i greatly appreciate your generosity",2

we also got child protective services called on us anonymously.  think it's the teacher but it may have been a parent.

"the death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.. generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. frankly, i believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

the child leaves almost nothing behind. it's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   on the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. they had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

i don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking i think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

"by c*mming so hard i fainted. so this happened a couple of days ago..

had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. after changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, i went to visit a dermatologist. anyways, turns out i have a skin condition called pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. so she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. after showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and i sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. i noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back reaalllyyy good. so naturally i took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. naturaly i decided to take it to the next logical level: flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (yes i know this sounds mildy retarded). what ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. i busted a nut so hard i started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and i fucking fainted. my parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a reaaal worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. so yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. fml

tl;dr: found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided i wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. came so hard i went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

i'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol

"update my(27f) son(6) doesn't like my boyfriend (31m). everyone thinks i should break up with him but i don't want to. what do i do?. original post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cohppg/my27f_son6_doesnt_like_my_boyfriend_31m_everyone/)

turns out it really was something his grandparents said as many of you suggested. they said some things that made my son think that my boyfriend and i will make our own family and he'll be the fifth wheel and i will no longer love him. i reassured him and made sure he understood i will always love him and that he will only have more people love him, not less. boyfriend and i agreed we needed to spend more time together with him and we've been doing that and he's warmed up to bf surprisingly quickly. so that's working out really well and my boyfriend has been really wonderful throughout this, i feel kind of ashamed for even considering breaking up with him. i've been told ""i told you so"" by my brother..

i have been putting off talking to his grandparents. but i will definitely talk to them before i let my son spend time with them again. i want to make it clear to them that it's not acceptable to say or insinuate things like that to my son but also want to reassure them that they will get to see him (so long as they don't put weird ideas in his head). i think i will see them by myself and lay it all out and then maybe have a little break before letting my son visit them...?

edit: thank you all for your kind words and advice. honestly overwhelmed by the amount of responses. wasn't expecting it. i know many of you think that i should cut his grandparents off but i honestly don't think they must've said something like that directly to him. maybe he misunderstood. i will find out for sure when i speak to them. i am taking this very seriously and it's definitely a possibility depending on how everything goes.",8

"if it's socially acceptable for women to put ""sorry, no short men"" as a requirement in online dating profiles, then it should also be acceptable for men to say ""sorry, no flat-chested women"", or ""no overweight women"" in theirs.. i understand that a women may only want a guy of a certain height for whatever reason they may have. that's fine. you are attracted to who you are attracted to and there is nothing wrong with that. 

maybe she just wants to warn a guy before wasting their time with meeting up somewhere, or stop them from getting their hopes up. i get that too. 

however, if a man were to say  ""sorry, no (blank)  women"", they would get accused of body shaming and everyone would lose their shit. 

it's a double standard, and its absolute bullshit. whereas someone would say of the woman ""oh, she's just very selective and knows what she wants"", they would say of the man ""what a pig! how dare he!"". no one would ever say ""he's just very selective and wants to find the perfect soul mate"".

i'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  i definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what i posted.  but hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes i guess.

anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  i told her everything that was going on.  the urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  i told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

she agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  she didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  she knew i was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. we talked about it sunday, but i can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  and so while she had thought we were communicating, i wasn't.  we decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

the money was the real problem for me. she agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  she offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if i really wanted we could move the money back.  she does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

we read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  it seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (cbavd) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. we're going to go back to the original specialist i was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  it turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  i told her i took off work to go with, and she was relieved i could join.

once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  after going through each thing i was just wishing i believed her a little more before. she's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. she even offered an open phone policy if i needed.  we did look at the text i had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  i declined though right now, since i don't want to be that husband.

this has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  that level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  i think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. i was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  this has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but i'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

she thought that an nipp asap was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  i'm not big on therapy, but i can probably agree that it will most likely help.

i'm feeling a little better about everything.  thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (every other comment here i read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   it's time for me to hopefully be a father.

"got a friend or family in the hospital? consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/ereader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.. note: *this is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

i was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. this made me realize what i would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- hospital hvacs systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. i was told they could only bump it up or down here at my va hospital. also, this was the first time i received an iv treatment and let me tell you they are cold... had an iv in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and i am pretty convinced i could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**warm, comfortable socks**- reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *credit*: /u/getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so i followed up and asked my nurse about this.  turns out, the va hospital does have socks available and my new rn was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


**condiments** - i believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. this problem might be compounded by medication. may have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **edit** i recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  generally, it would be wiser to consult with the rn or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**open toe slippers**- luckily i had flip flops on when i was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if i only had tennis shoes. probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**long, braided phone charger** - my wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. i can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. i recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. also, i am using a 5ft usb hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**entertainment**: a book, ereader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   the tv service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. if they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. the gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *edit* /u/stjerndale recommended audiobooks.  great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**gift cards**: *credit: /u/1900grs, /u/halftimeheaters.*  gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*bonus lpt*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  they take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  this bonus lpt is intended for *adult patients.*


edit 1

**power bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  this was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


edit 2

**eye mask & ear plugs** - /u/ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/suedeveil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**moisturizers & chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/fatjennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  i will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing.",9
"for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed?. me (28m) and fiancee (27f) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. i also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

on saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. i stayed with my parents but i left the dog with her because she likes having him there. however, *i made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on sunday i get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. she was drunk, so i told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. when i got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. i felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

but then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. the girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

when we got home, i told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. i told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and i'll tell mine. she was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, i get bombarded by messages on messenger, whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that i am insane to do this to her after 4 years. they started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

the logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. nope. they all fucking agree. my mom said: ""well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" lucky me, eh? my dog didn't fucking die!

my sister was appalled that i cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said i might have overreacted. yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. but i am so disgusted at my fiancee that i can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. she isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

by the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. she likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar dangerous things. it's not something i hold against her in the sense that i would ever mention in a fight, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. for example, my dog.

i'm 99% sure i will stand by my decision. but am i really an asshole? literally nobody is on my side and i have no idea what to think.

&#x200b;

**edit: posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. she is negligent and irresponsible and i don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. i'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. if she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, i would also leave her. i guess i realized i don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",3

update post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

so firstly thanks for all of your input. i read and considered every single reply. first i'll update you, then i'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. i want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, i'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and i feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

update: 

i spoke to her in person after i posted my update. from her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. she was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""i don't know, i'll probably tell him that i feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

i said great, all that is understandable. just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

she said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

i thanked her for telling me, and then i called off the wedding entirely. 

she cried, i cried, it was a goddamn mess. she asked where we go from here. i told her i don't know. i don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but i know that the engagement is over, and that **if** i decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. and now i have to decide if **i** want that. do i went to spend another 4 years being undecided? if i'm being honest with myself, i imagine it taking another couple of years before i can trust her again. do i want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? close to 40? 

i told her that i have a lot to think about. 

i spoke to her dad last night. we shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. my ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. she's been crying a lot. i do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

her dad caught wind of the situation on facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. he'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. she told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. he told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. he said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

so that's it. i still have a lot to think about. i know a lot of you guys are telling me that i have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that i still love her and have loved her for a few years now. right now, i'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

as for my reputation, nobody thinks i'm an abuser. it's firmly out there now. her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. i haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. there's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

my family agrees with a lot of you. they're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. just give me some time. i'm not going to make another update post, because i've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe i'll just update this post in a few days after i've decided what to do.",8

tldr: mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


i just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. this will be my final update.

a few days ago, the abortion was carried out. during the weeks beforehand, my gf went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. she was also tested for any stis (she's clear!).

she went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. a few days ago it was successfully carried out.

they went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. gf said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

when she came home, she cried and cried and cried. she says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

we took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). while in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

she's amazing, man. seriously.


update on the mum! so my gf received a call from her mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

my gf and i have an agreement that if mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. in this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

i told the mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. i then said ""how jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

my gf didn't find it funny...

anyway, that's it.


good luck to everyone in their lives.

"ny- i sent a rent check to landlord who then claimed non-payment. i sent a new check. he cashed it, then cashed the first check a few month later. i paid twice for the same month. is this fraud? criminal? where to report him. he's trying to evict me and the court case is ongoing.. ",2
"for sending my kid to school with ""adult"" snacks and lunches?. living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. i have a second grader who i have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. 

she came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. i thought for a minute that maybe i accidentally grabbed one of my quest bars or something for her and asked my daughter.

for her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. my daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, i put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. the teacher commented on it.

lunchtime came around, and i guess a similar thing happened. my kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week i made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and i guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. this is what sparked the note. 

so i explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured i'd skip the pickles next time. well, it wasn't good enough. just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a pb & j, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.

i called the teacher and asked her about the note. teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. i asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""no"" and ""this really shouldn't be a big deal.""

this might be where i fucked up. i told the teacher that i'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. that when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, i will continue to send my kid to school with the foods i pick. teacher got huffy and hung up. 

just to double check, i asked my daughter two things: does she like her lunches? (enthusiastic yes about most of them!) and ""are the other kids making fun of you?"" because i know that can be an issue. she said no, and that sometimes they even ask for a pickle too. 

so aita, or is this teacher way out of line?",3

"american ""left"" vs right politics is ultra toxic and how they have you riled against each other is just a means to keep the 2 party system alive and well.. they way i see it supported, on here not just the media, is like how people support sports teams. you all seem to just want to trigger each other pretending that your ""left"" is against all guns or that all conservatives hate gay people. as such seeing a responsible gun owner will make democrats angry and an inclusive senate will upset the conservatives. 

it really perpetuates the ""well i have to keep voting x or y will get into power"" mentality. i believe it is stirred up deliberately to make sure there will never be a viable third party.

"for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? my family is derisively calling me ""scott's tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.. edit: for all the people asking, scott's tots is an episode of the the office, the plot is michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. he assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. the episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. i've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of tv ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. i've watched the office 8 times and i skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. parks n' rec is a better show though...fight me. 

so how do i begin with this. i am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. my grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who i call niece because i truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. the condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise i would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. the stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (i really hope this is making sense). basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do i get to keep it long term. 

my cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to university of arizona so she can start next week. either they didn't know or didn't care about the gpa requirement because when i asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. i don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 gpa. i asked her how she got into uofa and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

i basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my grandma's will and that i will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

that's when all hell broke loose. my mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. my sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that i'm running my own version of ""scott's tots"" because i taking away money that was promised for education. there's also an undertone that i'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so i can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

no amount of explanation is helping. i've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can i keep their shares. if they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. no one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and i imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

there is really nothing stopping me from doing it. i write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what i'm doing. 

i have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the scott's tots thing because i don't want to be seen like that. 

would i be the asshole if i withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

edit: just for my own notes since i'm saving this thread and i guess if might help other people be clear.

"i'm so tired of reddit's uncontrollable need to be the funny man in the comments no matter how serious the post may be.. people on reddit have always had a great sense of humor to me, but sometimes the impulse to insert a joke or a pun or a series of weird strung along comments gets. fucking. old. 

sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. and you just have to give credit where credits due. but lately i've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. sometimes i feel like i should laugh at the cleverness of some. but it happens so often and in so many posts that i find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. not unless there's just a golden moment. i've even begun to roll my eyes the moment i open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. i never roll my eyes. at anything. 

i used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately i've been really turned off by it. maybe i just need a break.


edit: thank you for the gold and silver!  wow. this blew up... i just wanna add something to this. i'm not saying it's bad to have some fun in the comments. one of you pointed out that it's okay to be serious and to have fun. i agree. i'm saying that when i'm intrigued by a post sometimes i really want to see what the reddit community has to say about it... or to see if there's additional information in the comments. but a lot of the time all i see for miles is the repetitive back and forth joking. sometimes i really just wish the top comments had less to do with clever jokes and more to do with the content of that post...

edit: i never talked about acceptance speeches being annoying. i also never gave one. i said thank you. i'm learning real quick that a lot of people don't actually read your posts before commenting. lmao",6
"someone in my apartment building is smoking weed and it's coming into my unit through the ventilation somewhere, making everything i own smell like weed.. my wife is in the military, so this is a huge fucking deal. there's a ventilation shaft in the utility closet with the water heater, right next to the door, which is also right next to the washer and dryer. anyone outside of my door can smell the weed coming from the ventilation, and any time you walk into my apartment it's the first thing you smell. being a military family and having our laundry smell like weed can get us both in really, really big trouble. is there any way i can prevent this?  
  
it happens around 10 at night, clearly outside of the housing department's operating hours. this place was built in 2016, so it's pretty new.  
 
  
edit: wow this blew up. i was not expecting that. try to get back to the comments in the morning lol  
  
edit 2: thanks for all the responses, guys. wasn't expecting this to be popular at all. reading through most of the comments (and sorry i don't have time to reply to everyone!), i think my best temporary option is to try filtering the smell from the vent i think it's coming from as best as i can. if that doesn't work, i may try the ""positive air flow"" technique recommended by the thermodynamics stoner. a more long-term solution would be to contact housing if it continues to be a problem, as my only two concerns is that my apartment doesn't have a smell when i move out, and my wife's clothes don't smell like weed when she's at work.  
  
reading through my lease agreement, i actually don't see anywhere that mentions drug use, or even smoking of any kind. thinking back, the area around the demo room when we were being shown around before we signed a lease reeked of weed as well.  
  
lastly, i'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. i don't care if anyone else smokes weed. i was born and raised in austin. i can probably count on one hand how many people i knew that didn't smoke weed in my 30 years living there. i just don't think my apartment needs to smell like that, you know?

"by telling my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me. this happened approximately six years ago, i was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that i post it here. 

&#x200b;

so, flashback to undergrad, things are good and i just started dating this beautiful girl that i had met in class. i was enamored with her, shocked that i loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. the first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&#x200b;

after a few months into our relationship, i started to notice some concerning symptoms. as you can probably hypothesize, when i pee'd, it burned. at first, i just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, i decided to stop taking creatine just in case. but, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. i would literally be struggling to stand while i pee'd because the pain was so intense. after, i would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. it was bad. 

&#x200b;

well, at this point, i was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. no, it had to be what i thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. i hadn't been with anyone else. i hadn't been with anyone else since i began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. i was shocked. things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had i gone wrong? the thought made my blood boil, until i outright confronted her. i told her i knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. she told me no. i demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. she said sure. (looking back at this i feel like a complete dick). we agreed that we would go the next day.

&#x200b;

the same night i confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. she was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. around this time my roommates and i had just moved into a new house. in the process all our belongings got shuffled around. as she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" i heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, i've been pissing out bleach?!?! i instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. she took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr - months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when i pee'd. i told my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an std test. the night before we went, i inadvertently discovered that i had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap.

"police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while i was asleep. this has been a really weird morning... not sure if i chose the correct flair

i have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. he sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. i put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. around 3am i got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. she gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

at 6:30am i am awoken by a single low knocking sound. i get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point i usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more z's). as i exit my room i am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. i dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if i should serve them a drink. one cop asks me who i am to which i reply with my full name and ask what is going on. he continues his interrogation, asking if i live with a woman. fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. i answer that i live with my girlfriend. the cop asks me if i have a son to which i reply yes. he asks me where he is. at this point i lean over the wall and i see my door busted upen. i am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so i look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. i see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" the tell me to step out into the dining room and i put my hands up as i walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. i sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. i look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex i live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 the cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. he says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. he claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. they never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. my apartment has weird acoustics and i cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

he asks me why i didnt hear him and i told him i must have been deeply asleep. he asks if i am under the influence of drugs and i say i just went to bed late because i was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. as the cops leave i could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. the cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. i asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. i asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

so now i am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. i fear when i go outside i'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

i have been trying to understand the timeline of events. i went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. if the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. my son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. the cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" not a crying child. my son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? what about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? was that just an excuse to burst in? he sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

"by trying to gift my bf some sweet undies and subsequently spoiling his surprise proposal plans.  about three weeks ago, i began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who i'll call ""ray,"" to celebrate 4 years of dating.

we live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. he's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. i thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt i get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. they are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

i ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. i used his email on the sign-up so that i could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

one small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. i sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which i mean i entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. i simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. i know how to do this because i'm a brilliant hacker (i googled it).

while carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: a shipping confirmation for an engagement ring. i immediately noped off his computer, and of course i didn't open the email, but the damage is done. secret's out!

my heart fell right through my butt, you guys. i actually died and now i'm a ghost writing this.

i probably should have pretended i never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but i was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. within the hour i broke down and called ray to sheepishly confess what i had done. he wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that i spoiled the surprise. 

here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

my punishment for snooping is that the suspense is killing me. i've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

a romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, i thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""why would you think that i'm going to propose to you?"" he said. ""that sounds like something you wouldn't know about because i'd keep it secret in my personal email!""

now he's started intermittently faking me out. the other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. he keeps getting down on one knee... looking up at me... and saying, ""gotta tie this shoe!"" the emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is maddening. every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

one more thing: i somehow fucked up the email settings. the shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. so that surprise got spoiled, too. turns out i'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

i guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and i do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

if we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

"for ignoring my mom asking me to get involved with her new family after i got rich?. my mom left my dad when i was 17 (i'm 29 now) and had a new boyfriend literally straight away. we all suspected that she was cheating with this dude beforehand but there was never any proof and she even to this day refuses to admit it. she had 2 more kids with this guy. 

when my mom and dad broke up i moved out to live with my dad who had moved back in with his parents. the major reason for this was because she told me to leave as i kept fighting with her new dude. i really did not want to deal with a new guy in my moms life and i was really upset that she didn't give a shit about how much pain my dad was in. when she told me to leave...something in me changed and i am still unable to forgive her. that solidified bc my 14 year old sister stayed with my mom for a year and then begged to come and live with my dad because she hated it so much at my moms place. and my sister and mom were close so for my sister to feel that way it must have been bad. 

since i was 18 my grandparents kept pushing me to start a business bc i like to tinker and had built a few specialised tools for a niche construction industry that my dad was in and they saw potential in me. they gave me a lot of money as an investment (actually they re mortgaged their house that's much they believed in me) and basically, i majorly lucked out and managed to land some national contracts at 24 that turned into more than a few millions of dollars over a few months when the business boomed. the profit trajectory has risen since then and basically, i'm living a life i never thought would be for a shmuck like me. 

i moved my dad, sister, and grandparents out to the east coast a couple years back and we've started a new life. i am surrounded by people who see and saw the best in me and i'm grateful so much bc i was seriously messed up after my mom blew our family apart. 

for the last couple years or so my mom has been on my case to reunite with her. she is getting increasingly more insistent that i go visit her and her boyfriend and kids and keeps trying to guilt trip me because my sister has a much more privileged life now and my younger two half siblings don't. she keeps telling me that 'even if i don't forgive her i should look out for the kids as they're innocent in all this' 

because day to day i have no interest in helping her or her family? imo she made her bed and she can lay in it but the guilt eats me alive sometimes. i just can't forgive her though.",3

anyway, being a horny teenager i fapped in regular intervals. unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and i was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. one day i hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. honestly to this day i can't fathom why i thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


i end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. i decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. i fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so i blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

for the next week the coconut is my saviour. whenever i want to get off i simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. it's heaven. now before i continue i'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


about a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (i had been using it pretty much every day since then) i begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. must be the coconut right? so i decide that i'll fuck it once more before i throw it out and get a new one.


**worst mistake i have ever made.**


you see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. as i penetrate the coconut one last time i begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. puzzled, i pull my cock out to discover that it is covered in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *teeming with tiny fucking maggots*. they were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


i screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck i was doing with my life. 


**never again. never again.**


tl;dr don't fuck coconuts.



edit: jesus this exploded. i'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because i sure cry everytime i think back to it.

"by unknowingly doping for the entire school year. this has been in the making since last september. this is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.

late last summer i started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. i'm a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.

though i've always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call i needed to start working out. beside hitting the gym, i also joined a sharpshooting club, and was i was natural at it. over the course of a few months i moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. my aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.

i'm pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but i sure as hell didn't. in the meantime a cardiologist said ""tough shit"" and bumped up the meds.

during the course of this school year i was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. the stakes were high, but i was a stone cold shooter. later that day checking out my fitbit, i found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when i had to bicycle over the the range.

flash forward 2 more tournaments to today. my friend jokingly mentioned that i must've been doping to do so well and the dots connected. i googled ""metoprolol doping"", there it was. i still haven't told anyone, but reddit. what the hell do i do now?

tl:dr started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug.",4

i am equally psyched and afraid of what might happen, that is going to destroy my insides.  let's do this!

ps. i will have this filmed and post it on youtube with links.  not gonna be happy, but i will post video evidence whenever i can, maybe even the poopy (gross).

update #2: i'll be buying bread later today and doing this. i'll post a link here to youtube with the process. two questions: what sub should i post it in, in addition to linking it here? and is there any free video editing software, for trimming any boring parts, or blurring anything out (in case i have like a letter with my name and address out and i realize after the fact)?

"update i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. hey folks.

in proper internetiquette, i'd like to first say thank you to the community for your incredible response to what was a really bad day. i received so much support, constructive criticism, advice, and just genuine human connection. your concern, discernment, thoughtfulness... this is one of the best reasons for the internet to exist. even your scorn, some of you. i'm a big believer in ripping off the band-aid, and ya'll really let me have it. but when i said before that i wanted to take all of it in, i meant it. i intend to walk away from this situation a better person than before. tl;dr at bottom.

to the meat and potatoes: **i got my money back.** it wasn't as difficult as some of you feared. it was a simple text exchange yesterday, no heavy words. i also got a thank you from the newlyweds separately. i was surprised by the bride, but i welcomed it. you should welcome all positivity. i said my congratulations again and moved on with my life. i feel like, thanks to you all, i explored every thread in the tapestry of how i should feel and what i could say. it brought a well-measuredness to my thinking that otherwise would have taken maybe months to come by. you saved me from miles of tortured internal dialogue during my daily commute. you saved me from rash actions and words i wouldn't have been able to take back.

i know some of you will wish i went off. but i want peace, and what's the metaphor? bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity? i just don't need that kind of negativity in my life and what i'm trying to say is, i know now that i was just as responsible for how terrible an experience i had. this isn't a self-blame thing, i'm not being low-self esteem. the fact of the matter is, i could have said no, and i could have established a pattern of saying ""no"" to things prior to this that would not have led me to being treated the way i was treated. from so many of you i've learned that this is called self-worth. self-worth would not have seen me say endlessly, ""sure.""

don't get me wrong. i still 100% believe that if someone asks you to do something on their wedding day that you can do without undue burden to yourself, you should do that thing. it's their wedding day. and this goes double for people you're very close to. but you should also know your own limits, and you should teach those limits to others in how you allow yourself to be treated. and yeah, i accept that some of the things asked of me that day, in the context of being very close friends, seemed really shitty, and it felt that way. but from the moment the last groomsmen invitation went out, i should have reassessed the relationship. measured my value without the context of groom's friendship and focused on that.

i think part of the reason why i took so much on was to prove that, even in the face of being called unworthy, i could stand tall as the good friend and person i know i am. maybe some small part of me thought i could prove to the bride that i was someone she should have always counted on. show the groom how a groomsmen should be. this was foolish in a lot of ways, and it ended up costing me all of this torment. you should do good things not to prove a point, but because it adds value to the world. this can be done in a way that doesn't eat you from the inside. i know this now.

so what's the plan from here vis-a-vis my relationship with my friend? i think he made that clear. if i was so important to groom, i'd have been by his side that day, but i'm not so important, and so i wasn't. this is fine. it was his decision, and i told him myself the day he told me i was originally on the roster, ""no matter what anyone says, you need to choose the people who will get you down that aisle."" it's not the place of anyone else to judge his choices. certainly not me. not anymore. ultimately, this means i maintain a respectful distance, but will emphasize the distance. i have no intention of chasing after others to be in my life. when you find the right people, there is no chase. and one day, i'll let him know why he's the usher at my wedding. i don't think that's vindictive more than it is reciprocation. we won't have hella cursive name cards.

i want to impress upon you, if you are still reading this, that you have been part of my evolution. i was already in a place of growth and recovery and building, and god damn if this experience and your input wasn't a hell of a step towards becoming a better me. i'm not going to be a doormat, but i'm also not going to be fucking heartless. if people need help and i can help, i will. i'll just love myself better by knowing when to stop. i know that i'm a good friend, and a great person, and i'm not going to let my mistakes, or anyone else's, change that.

i know that i still have my problems and i'm working through them, and if, when reading my experience, you felt a bit of yourself in me, i want to encourage you: i used to be so self-conscious about myself, i'd sit down with my knees pressed inward and and my arms crossed tight because i didn't want anyone to notice how much space my fatness took up. i used to think that the only reason women smiled at me was because they were politely hoping i'd go away. i used to think that, to have friends and be accepted, you had to give them every bit of value you possess. i'm not that guy anymore, even if the wedding proved that i still have old tendencies, and if you're going through something like this, you can change, too.

i mentioned i was always an overweight person, but i should also say that i've lost 122lbs to date and i'm going to keep going (my goal is another 50lbs). at my average weekly rate, i'll hit my goal in less than six months. if you're struggling similarly, i want you to know that you can do it (dm for emotional weight loss support, please no essential oil pitches). also, this was supposed to be a thing where i counterpoint each of the previously stated insecurities in the above paragraph with some stark successes, but tbh women i'm in to still don't seem romantically interested in me, or i can't tell if they are (dm your relationship tips on how to figure this mystery out), but i'm not so insecure about it anymore. i know that when women smile at me, it's because i made a really bad pun and their better senses betrayed the smile. finally, and this is key, i know who my friends are, and i know that i never had to do anything but be my fucking self and they'd gravitate towards me (you might be thinking of a fat joke here, don't). i know that my real friends asked why i was working the wedding. they asked not why, but how in the hell wasn't i the best man, let alone not be in the wedding party. they tried to get me to stand up and dance when they noticed i was down. they invited me in to pictures. they said they wished i'd had a better time. they commiserated with me the morning after the wedding. they told me, in no uncertain words, that they appreciated how i go above and beyond for people. they told me that, at some point, i have to ask myself if doing this was worth overspending myself. focus on these kinds of people in your life.

you'll have your lingering questions about this. i'm sorry that this post became more of a introspective reflection rather than going in to more details about the wedding drama, of which, naturally, there was no shortage. if you have more questions, ask them and i'll answer. if you have more advice, i'm all ears.

i just want to close with this: so many of you offered to be my friend, and i want to live up to that. the heaviness i felt was lifted, message by message, in your every positive thought and shared painful experience. you helped me feel not alone. i want this to be the standard for everyone moving forward. please, treat each other like good friends. if you are ever down, if you ever want advice, if you need to hear an embarrassing life story to bring levity to your situation (my life story is filled with movie-level embarrassment) please dm this account. i'm here for you.

&#x200b;

tl;dr i got my money back, i learned a thing or two, i'm your friend.

"by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.. the overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. i bought a replacement bulb but when i put that one in it was also barely lighting up so i realized the unit was bad.  

the fan still worked great, it literally is the best fan i've ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. the fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so i didn't really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn't get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


so since then over the years my wife and i have had to make due with no overhead light. we open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. it's never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so i keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

after 6 years of living in the dark, this winter i just decided i would replace the damn thing. but before i did, i decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it's possible both bulbs i had tried were bad. 

so i'm up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as i'm turning the light on i realize:

the goddamn thing is dimmable. 


for 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to ""dim"". 

fuck me. 

tl;dr

for 6 years i lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",4
"for being upset because my son didn't talk to me, but talked to my wife.. i'm 40m, my wife is 39f, son in 15.

 i went downstairs and told my wife about it. she went upstairs to talk to him and stayed there for half an hour. she came back and brought him food upstairs. when i asked her what was wrong she said that it wasn't anything important and told me to drop it. i got kind of upset because i want to know what was wrong and i'm his parent as well.

"parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl. i've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. my parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

these girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

i'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but i feel they still need to be taught that. 

and same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

edit; if a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. he definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. if that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

this post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. that way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",6
"i (19f) dumped and blocked my boyfriend (19m) for his comments about my neighbourhood.. i don't want anyone having the slightest clue about where i'm from, so i'll be kinda vague.

&#x200b;

i live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang-related violence. it wasn't all bad, because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other. it's home. now that i'm at a huge university in my city, i've met people from all types of backgrounds. of those people, is my boyfriend, who is from a well-off family. he's never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn't cry when your parents think you're sleeping. but i was taught not to talk about money, so we really never covered that. we really did love each other and he made me feel complete.

&#x200b;

in my neighbourhood there is a small *""establishment""* that offers free *""services""/""products""* to kids who get good report cards/gpa. that applies from elementary school and until the end of college. college kids who provide id also get a crazy discount. finishing high-school isn't something super common, so it's a great way to reward us. the good-grades thing usually stops after like 6th grade, so it's a great way to encourage kids.

it's like, in my hood hood and hasn't been ""discovered"" yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy. i think they're too scared to come this far out lmao. it's super lowkey.

i took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time. he never seemed scared or judgemental. when we walked in, i was getting out my school id. i explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me. he laughed. i asked him what was so funny.

he said ""they shouldn't applaud a fish for swimming"". i asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that.

he says that they're just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum. that getting good grades and going to school is an expectation, not something super revolutionary. i told him that is where i live. it's not easy to stay in school, when nobody around you does.

this started a huge argument.

i asked him how many friends of his dropped out, he said none. i have 3. they were smart kids, but they got caught up in dumb shit. it's really easy to do that in my neighbourhood. my mom goes to a new funeral every week. some of the kids i grew up with are in jail right now. my mom still hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to. he said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don't deserve is like welfare. that there's ""nothing impressive about not being a criminal, it's basic requirement for being a part of society"". and that shouldn't get you free shit from a ""ghetto ass *'establishment'* '"". that this is why people get dependant on welfare.

at this point i told him i was done. i didn't want to debate, i didn't want to talk him. not then, not ever again. we just went out separate ways. i broke up with him as soon as i got home.

he thinks it doesn't make sense for us to break up after something so small. that we're not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation. i told him, yes the fuck we are. he's been trying to contact me but he's blocked on everything.  i think i may have overreacted with the block, but i want him to leave me alone. i don't want to work it out.

all my friends agree with me, but they've lived in the same neighbourhood..

i'm not saying i have to be with someone who's from my hood. but i have to be with someone who at least gets it. especially when ""it"" has shaped who i am today. idk what kind of person i am, but i think i might need to be in a relationship with someone who gets it. that ""establishment"" means a lot to me.

edit: i'm sorry i wasn't clear. should i let him reach out to me? i don't want to get back together, but should i unblock him and talk it out. i'm worried that i'll fold and we might get back together. i've seen my friends do it all the time, they always go back. i'm worried conversation will make that happen to me. **i didn't suddenly stop loving him** and he still means a lot to me. but our core values don't align. what he said and did disgusted me. in the very place that means so much to me, he shit all over it.

edit: guys i did not make it out the hood at 19, i still live there lmao. i'm still a fulltime student at a big university in my city, working my ass off so one day i can get my whole family out.

"by texting my pregnant wife that ""this isn't working"". my wife posted earlier today on la about this. not using my main because my fil knows it and i'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

i went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. i had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when i turned it on. most of them were asking how i could do this. i had no clue what she was talking about. she didn't answer any of my calls back.

i got home and she was packing up to leave. i'll admit it, i cried. a lot. had no clue what was happening or what i did. finally, it comes out that i texted her that i wanted a divorce. she showed me the text and i immediately realize what happened.

this morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. i texted her ""the new mirror came in! i'm going to try to put it together but i may need your help later"". i had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. i texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point i think i need to just give up"". apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. so my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while i was off thinking everything was great. she even called a divorce lawyer.

things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. she told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

tl;dr accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.

edit: wow, this blew up. to address a few things that came up in the comments:

\-i usually work from home unless i need to meet with clients. i don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. that's why she didn't know i was at work yesterday. i'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. if my phone goes off, i could lose my job, and our health insurance.

\-my wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. that's why she had the reaction she did.

\-my comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. neither of us is mad at the other. this was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. we're fine. i posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. no need to psychoanalyze my wife or pm me about divorce. we are fine.

\-and no, we haven't put the mirror together yet. we weren't really in a ""home improvement"" mood last night.",4

(she is us 14.)

i agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group's conversation moved along. 

yesterday ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. i really liked the green bateau dress so i checked if they had it in my size (i am us 8) and they did so i told our group that i was going to order the bateau dress. no one replied immediately, but i didn't think too much about it because it's not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. i ordered the dress.

a few hours later i got a call from one of my friends saying that ana called her and was upset that i ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn't buy it because it wasn't available in her size. my friend said ana thinks i'm trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that i can wear the dress she likes because i'm skinnier. 

to be honest i have mixed emotions about what ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so i tried calling ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that i didn't intend for her to feel that way. but she hasn't answered my calls or messages. 

so i just want to know: for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress ana liked but couldn't buy because they didn't have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?",3

"airport confiscated insulin. my diabetic (t1) mother flew from michigan to florida today with a connecting flight in philadelphia. she has been having a lupus flare up, so i arranged for a wheelchair for her weeks ago to take her to her gates/baggage claim. i also confirmed that she could bring a medical bag with get insulin and medication. when she landed in philadelphia, they said they didn't have a chair for her so she had to walk across multiple terminals to get to her gate. when she was boarding the plane, the ticketing agent told her she couldn't bring the medical bag on board (basically an insulated lunch box). she explained it had insulin in it which she needs to have with her. they told her she could check it or she could stay in philadelphia, but she couldn't bring it on board. she surrended the bag, boarded the plane super upset. when she landed in tampa, the wheelchair guy was waiting for her. he took her to baggage claim and i guess her medical bag was lost. she is now in florida with no insulin, no medication. her doctors are working with her insurance to get authorization for her get enough to hold her over.

"my fiance took my birth control pills and stabbed holes into condoms to try and get me pregnant.. i'm in my late 20s and i got engaged for my fiance (29) who i've been with for 9 years. our relationship has never really been tested and we get on really well. but recently he brought up that he wants kids. i said no i'm not ready and probably won't be for a few years. he got really mad and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes. i just moved on from it and didn't give it a second thought. 

a week later i couldn't find my birth control pills, they are usually in the bathroom cupboard but i couldn't find them anywhere. later that night he wanted to have sex, i said i couldn't find my bc pills and he said it's alright he'll use a condom, i supposed that was alright so he went and got one from the bathroom. for the next few weeks we just used a condom and i didn't take the pill. in hindsight i should have got more when i couldn't find the original pack but i couldn't be bothered (my fault) 

on a few occasions we were having sex i noticed the condom was split, he clearly noticed all times and didn't say anything so i said stop. the next day i was putting the recycling in the trash, as i was putting it in i seen my pills at the bottom. i instantly knew he had binned them. he knows i deal with the trash so why we he be so stupid to just put them in recycling. 

it all made sense so i confronted him about the pills and condoms and he couldn't answer me. he just kept walking away. i was so mad at him, it's not right. you can't just force someone to be pregnant just because you want a baby. does he have to carry it for 9 months?

"hey assholes, you're doing it wrong.. since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time i ranted about voting on this sub. so, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: welcome to the sub! second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

you may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **upvote real dilemmas**. if you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the op is an asshole or not, **upvote it**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. if you see a post where you think the op is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **upvote it** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **stop rewarding validation posts**. upvotes are not a political statement. they aren't something you give because the op is really nice. every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the op is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the op, they're ruining the sub. if you want to tell op they're great, write an nta comment and praise them all you want. don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

as you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. what makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. this is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. please be the better person and vote correctly here. interesting content depends on it!  (if you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

also important: in the comments, show a little backbone. **don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** if you say the post is nta, and someone else says it's esh, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. if you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. there are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. the whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. if you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and gtfo. you have come to the wrong place.

p.s. if you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. maybe you're not an asshole after all.

"doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. i'm 22 and no longer even live with her.. background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. my gp who i have seen since i was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. i moved away for college when i was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new gp and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since i've seen him half my life. 

i get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication i take to make sure that i'm not getting too little/too much. the results of this information or the fact that i have those tests done isn't a big secret i want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless i were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

the first time i had this work done, i hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. they even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/ml the medication level was. again, it's not like to my mother this is anything i want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and i never received any call about my results. i go in for these monthly, so the next month that i went i told the woman working in the lab of the office that i wanted to update my information to make sure i got the results (i thought also since i had been seeing this doctor since i was 10 i probably had never given them my phone number). a few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; i again got no call from the office. once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when i explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, i was a little tipped off that i wasn't called again. i chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

at this visit i had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. he asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. i wasn't worried that i was pregnant, but i knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. i asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. it did, so on my way out i stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that i and i alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. they nonchalantly agreed and i asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. i happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. my mom blew up at me asking why i needed to take a pregnancy test (i didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). that all blew over, but at this point i was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

i ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of hipaa and she knows it after working in a hospital. she laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since i was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - i'm your mom!""

since then, i've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. to no surprise there are no issues. i don't really know what to do here. since i cut ties with that doctor, i no longer have personal problems with this, but i'm sure other people do without even knowing it. i don't have resources really for a lawyer. i might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. so how serious is it really?

"update2: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

tldr: my gf was raped. wanted to abort. talked to mother. decided not to abort. i left her. 

update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

tldr: gf calls me, reveals mum made her not get an abortion because god cares. she wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. some of reddit think i'm a baby killer.


i was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but i thought i should provide an update on some recent events from a mother from the pits of satan's rectum.

on saturday, i answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. they asked me if i was who i was, and i replied i was. they then said they were looking for my gf. i called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.

the officers then split, one taking the gf to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.

the officer who took me started asking me questions about how long gf had been here. if she had any contact with anyone else. if she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. i answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on gf. i asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say. 

after a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. the moment they left, my gf told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if i had been hurting her. she was also asked if she was being held against her will. she said no to everything, of course. she said that the police received a call from her mother saying she might be in danger, and that i could be abusive her.

i was fucking livid. i immediately said i was going to press charges against her - for what? i dunno. harrassment probably?

my gf begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to ""calm down"".

wtf? she sent police to my house to get me arrested. how is that sane thinking? i could lose my job if i was arrested and charged. what the hell is she thinking?

i told gf that if the mother does anything like this again, i will definitely press charges. so the gf decides on sunday to talk to the mum to not do anything like this again.

they had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then i start hearing sobs. immediately, i walked into the room, saw my gf was crying, still holding the phone against her ear. 

i plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as i heard ""hello?"" from the phone. then i put it on me, and said ""you're a disgrace of a mother"" and hung up.

then i held the gf for what felt like an hour before we started talking.

apparently, the mother was telling gf how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the mother again, or her brother, or her deceased father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat gf, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because gf would be going to damnation.

i told gf that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. i love her smile.

what do you think, if anything, should i do about the mother? no doubt my words to her will have some reactions.


response to some people from previous threads and pms after thread was locked:

1 - abortion was never an option. gf was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her mother. and if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.

2 - you can believe my gf cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, i suppose.  just fyi, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. cheating...right........

edit: 3 - my gf and i are still going to therapy about all of this.",8

she gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. she cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. she always goes to the same coffee shop. 

me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. she always says the guy who serves her coffee is ""beautiful"", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. that was fine. 

anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. i trust her entirely, i know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

anyway, i went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. i ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and i shit you not he said ""oh is that for emma?"" and when i looked shocked he went ""i just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it"". i said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. the guy kinda laughed and i said that i appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, i think he was flirting. he laughed again and said sure thing. 


i didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare i embarrass her like that. this pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! she said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend.

"worlds fastest update - refused dna test (ca). while i was getting my ass handed to me in this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. from what i hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, i don't think they actually took anyone's dna.


many people pointed out that i sounded sketchy in my original post. that was probably true. i'm a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and i did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. i didn't know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so i thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things i never got caught for would come up. if i knew i was just being tested against a baby, i would have said sure.


i want to say that *because* of my past, i'm a squeaky clean employee- i never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an advil from the med cart. we're not supposed to ever be alone with members, and i never am, even if i'm just dropping off a tray in someone's room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen. i guess i was acting paranoid because i was pissed about being suspected when i've tried so hard to be straight, and that ended up making me seem more suspicious. 


hopefully now that the guy who did it was arrested, things can go back to normal. i hope the woman who was raped is doing okay (she's not here anymore, and i don't know what is happening). sorry for the novel, but i wanted to let everyone know what was going on.

"there was this tramp.. one cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slided over to a little girl. he managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. he took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

coincidentally the father drives up. ""how can i ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""just name your price - i'm a wealthy man.""

""ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, i'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""oh dear,"" says the father, ""i don't carry much cash with me, i only have ten pounds - but come home with me and i'll get more from the safe.""

""no! no!"" says the tramp, ""why ten pounds is more money than i've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""i'm rich! i'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

he finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""i'll have one holiday please!""

""ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""oh, any holiday i don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""ten pounds! you'll never get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

she goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. there - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""i've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""i'll take it!""

a few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""but i've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and i want on!""

""well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, i don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. come back at midnight when it's dark and i'll let you on then.""

so the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. it was the captain.

""hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

the tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

first they went down through the first class level: oriental carpets - 6"" pile. a genuine rembrandt on every wall. leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

then the second class: as above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""a room of my very own.""

""i'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. so that's what the alarm clock is for. enjoy your cruise.""

well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. one-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. he had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

he climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""that was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""where did you learn to dive like that?""

""um, well i've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""i've never seen..."" he broke off. ""hey, i've got an idea"", he started again. ""how would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. i'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""it's a deal!"" says our man. for the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""okay, i'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. we're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""okay,"" agreed the tramp.

two days passed, and the big day arrived. the ship was humming with excitement. everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. the captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""let's see what you can do."" and with that the captain handed him a walkie talkie. and the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the solar system...

he reached the board.

he climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and then...

through the asteroid belt,

past mars,

and the moon,

faster,

and faster,

faster - ever faster,

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

faster, and faster,

past the albatross,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""i can see him!"" yelled a passenger, ""look!!!""

the tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

not a ripple on the surface!

down through the water!

smashed through the pool bottom!

down through the first deck!

smashing through the second!

down!

down!

through the crew's quarters!

through the engine rooms!

smashing through his own little cabin!

and down through the double-strength steel hull of the ship!

still down...!

deeper,

deeper into the murky depths,

till.........

smash!

into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

up and up, desperate, gasping...

out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""hero!"" ""wonderful!"" ""amazing!"" ""good show that!""

and handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""well tramp, i have never seen anything like that, ever. that was the most *stupendous* piece of diving i have ever seen.""

the tramp blushed.

the captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

and the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""well you see...

""for me to tell you, i'll need $49.95""

the captain outrageously asked why.

the tramp said

"by suggesting twin peaks as a joke for the location of a company meeting.. about two months ago there was a page on the intranet for our company for the location of the corporate quarterly meeting.

as a joke i wrote in twin peaks as one of the suggestions.

i am guessing the person running it either wanted to see the world burn or thought the restaurant was like the tv show because it was one of the actual voting options on the intranet. the trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a huge margin.

i am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most rsvp's the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.

the day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. in the entire process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. the organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. the waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.

about an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. by then it was too late. the money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.

i have to hand it to upper management. they powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. although he did start the meeting with. ""i was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company's history, but i think i know why so many of you joined us today."" this drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.

other than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.

it took all of 3 hours after the meeting for it to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.

i was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.

i came in this morning and was informed i am to receive a write up for this. they are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. they understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at twin peaks.

tl:dr suggested twin peaks as a joke location for meeting. bosses did not research twin peaks at all and we had a quarterly meeting at the location. i got written up for it. ",4

"for despising my mentally handicap sister?. the title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200b;

my sister is severely autistic. she requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. she is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200b;

i hate her. that should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200b;

i was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. even since i can remember the world has revolved around her. i was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. all of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when i complained. even when i was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me i was in the wrong.

&#x200b;

along with this i am expected to take care of her and drop everything i do for her. i can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. even when i do somehow get time to myself i am required to leave if they need me. if i do not then i am punished. the recent example of this is when i went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200b;

it seems as if i am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. this last week i was chosen to give a speech at a school event. i was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200b;

i've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. while talking about colleges with my father, he joked that i should get a degree that pays well so when their gone i can take care of my sister. i don't know why but this caused me to break down. i cried and screamed about how it always about her. i'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that i'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200b;

i've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. am i the asshole here?

&#x200b;

edit/update kinda:

wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. i never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. thank you all. after thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that i don't despise my sister. it's not her fault that she was born the way she is. my parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but i was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. they have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. my parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best i leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

"update tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto, ontario

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant\_is\_renting\_out\_my\_apartment\_on\_airbnb/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

just wanted to thank you all for your support/advice, i was really dumb and naivee when it comes to renting out my apartment. the last time i rented it out the tenant left on time, and i never actually thought about what could happen if they didn't leave.

i have started the process of evicting the tenant today, with support from a local lawyer who is going to handle a bunch of the paperwork for me, and represent me.

my condo board thankfully has been super understanding as soon as i outlined that it was being done without my knowledge, and they have agreed to wave the penalties. apparently there were noise complaints on friday relating to my apartment which annoyed our condo board. our concierge service (we have someone at the front desk 24/7), will no longer be allowing people to leave keys for people at the front desk.

on sunday two people came in to the building asking for keys to my unit, and our concierge  service asked if they were airbnb tenants, and they said yes. he then basically told them to leave right away, and they aren't welcome here.

jane finally got in touch with me today, and basically accused me of numerous things, from harassing her renters, to just in general making her life difficult. she also stated that she will be going to the ltb to ""make a formal complaint because banning airbnb is not allowed"". when i pointed out that as people have told me here that she needs to get  my permission before renting out to other people. she went a rant about how she is doing this for numerous places and how she has never had a problem and ""how stupid i am for making her my enemy"".

i have a ton of proof of what she is doing, honestly my biggest concern is what is going to happen to my apartment. i asked a friend to book my room for one night through airbnb for tomorrow (as it just apparently became available for rent), and take a look at the state of my apartment.",2

"while talking dirty to my gf. throwaway for obvious reasons.

so a little background: my current gf and i have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. before her i was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and i'm learning everything for the first time. long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. i said i was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside i knew that i had no idea what i would be doing and would kind of be winging it. last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. so we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. she's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
she kind of rambled for a bit, and i was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. the rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than i normally do. this is all new territory for me, but i'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like christopher columbus, and she's what i think is india. so i decide to talk dirty. her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, i figure this is the perfect time to strike. and that's when i cleverly decided to ask if i make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

her face fell. it's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. i went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. i've been wondering how i could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. we approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. i don't think i'll be redeeming myself anytime soon. 

tldr: i decided to be sexy and asked my gf if i made her moister than an oyster. she doesn't think oysters are sexy.",4

i said that i can understand people who are in the industry who go, so men/women looking to further their career. but the dudes who go as fans that aren't in the industry are just weirdos and losers. i've seen videos/pics and they look just as you'd expect them to.

i think it's a bizzare and sad thing to actually be fans of pornstars to the extent to visit them at conventions..

"for telling my new neighbours that i've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends?. i've been away since thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently sunday afternoon where i live.  here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that monday to friday, which means i had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. 

my 30 something year old neighbours moved in on friday when i wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when i was collecting my mail. she goes ""don't check your mailbox on weekends. they don't deliver on weekends. so don't check it."" (in a rude karen voice, if you know then you know.) already, i know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and i'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so i said ""i know, it's just i've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so i had to check the mailbox."" i don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

she seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. then we both went inside and that was that. about 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking i was held captive in my basement which i don't have, so i explained to them what i had said and they just laughed and left.

just before, i was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think i was kidnapped

"by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today.... when i was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. so spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and i thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  i had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
the googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until i had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out i pushed it even further in. i was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. i could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, i stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. after a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

skip forward to this tuesday;
i do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and i was submerged under water, after i emerged and pulled my boat out i could hear a slight rattle in my ear and i knew instantly what it was.
it's now friday and the rattling happens every time i turn my head and i still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

tldr: put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... it didn't

so this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don't believe it, which is fair enough cause i think it's abit mental aswell.

however i'll get a doctor's visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and i'll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.

alot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and i can honestly say i don't have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think they're as big of thing in the uk.

"i (21f) had sex with a guy i met on tinder last night (25m). to me it was entirely consensual but about 10 minutes after he was crying and telling me i took advantage of him while he was emotionally vulnerable. what in the hell do i do?. i guess some background is in order, i met this guy on tinder about two weeks ago and we sort of chatted back and forth, we had a dinner date on wednesday and agreed to meet again on saturday. i did know that he had a recent break up but he told me over and over again he was ready to get back out there. 

so last night we had a great time. we ended up going back to my place and one thing led to another and we had sex. the sex was actually really good and he did most of the ""work"" so again i had no idea he wasn't into it. so after finishing i was just telling him hat i really liked him and would love to do it again but the mood just somehow just changed. 

at first he started saying he shouldn't have done that. i was like ohhhhhh-kay but whats done is done so lets just go back to being chill since we both enjoyed it. then he started crying and started basically verbally attacking me that what i had done was the equivalent of ""male-r@pe"" and that i knew he was vulnerable but i'd pressured him into sex anyways. i told him that i was really sorry but i saw it differently. he ended up getting dressed and ran out. he was crying so loud and so intently i could actually hear him in the parking lot outside my balcony sliding glass door. 

he drove away and i haven't heard anything from him at all. i am so lost as to what to do. 

1. should i call him and apologize? even though i feel i didn't do anything wrong?

2. should i call him to check on him but not apologize, and maybe just explain my side of the story?

3. should i just swayze him and say i've dodged a bullet?

4. should i actually contact the legal services department at my school in case he was serious about the ""male r@pe"" allegation?


thank you so much for the help!! i'm so lost!

tl;dr: was basically accused of taking advantage of a guy i met on tinder. i'm lost as to what to do next?
 

edit as of 840 az time: he just called me. he was very stiff and said he wanted to talk about last night. i said i wasn't comfortable with that and very confused. he kept trying to goad me into talking and i asked sort of joking ""what are you recording me or something?"" and then he hung up. something tells me i stepped in a huge pile of shit. my dad is paying for me to consult with a lawyer first thing tomorrow...wow that was a hard conversation to have. 

well if i become the first female #metoo you saw it here first.

"for making my kid give a gift she really wants for her bday to the person she stole from?. my daughter turns 11 in ~6 weeks. she has been begging for a nintendo switch. due to poor grades & overall bad attitude, we decided not to get a switch. money isn't the issue... it's her behavior; she acts very entitled & she's lying left & right. i just don't feel now is the right time for a switch.

the theft: 

on easter, we (my husband, our kids, & myself) are at my husband's aunt & uncle's house. aunt & uncle have 2 adult children, one of whom is mentally delayed (we'll call her cousin); she functions @ about a 10 yr old level but is in her 40s. she lives in an assisted living apartment & has a job where she gets paid ~$5 a week, so she doesn't get many upscale things unless they are a gift. well, cousin had an old game boy that she saved up to buy & was playing while we were there. she eventually set it down & moved on to playing a board game with us while the kids ran around playing.

well..... this is where it goes to hell in a handbag.

my kid decided to be an epic turd & took the gameboy. she snuck it out of aunt & uncle's by asking if she could go to our car to look for a book she had brought, & stashed it in the glove box. she proceeded to hide the fact that she had the gameboy for several days, even after being asked where she last saw it (her opening to come clean) when aunt & uncle called & asked if we had seen where cousin might have left it.

due to cousin's challenges, she was utterly distraught over her missing gameboy. it's one of the few forms of entertainment she has, & she worked hard to have it.

i'm disappointed about the thievery, but i'm even more upset over my kid's attitude about being caught. i only found out about it because her sisters ratted her out. even then she absolutely refused to tell me the truth & tried to pin it on her sisters. it wasn't until i sat there & thought about it that i knew she was lying to me. once i told her i knew it had to be her because of xyz did she finally confess. her behavior only got worse from there. she refused to apologize when uncle & cousin came by to get the gameboy, & had the balls to act like she was the one being wronged. 

i feel like i need to drop the hammer on her and send the message home that stealing is not ok. i think that purchasing the switch (with my daughter's help from money she would ""earn"" by doing extra chores) & having her give it to cousin might be a good way to deliver that message while simultaneously giving cousin a nice upgrade to make amends.

i mentioned this to a friend & they said this would be a dick move because... birthday... i don't really think that matters, but the comment was enough to make me question myself. what do you think reddit?

edit: thank you all for the replies. i just wanted to let everyone know who is suggesting therapy that we have been taking advantage of that option. 

also - i do intend on giving my kiddo the opportunity to earn a switch down the line, just not in such close proximity to this incident. not sure how or when, since i have a so to consult, but the opportunity will be provided in some way.



***edit: i'll add more context here because some people are making assumptions and saying i'm ta for being a lazy parent. our therapist is of the opinion that my daughter largely has these issues because of the inconsistent co-parenting relationship her bio dad has with my husband and i. my husband and i are big on structure, boundaries, natural consequences, and following through. her bio dad is the exact opposite of us. he and his family hardly ever tell her ""no"" to the things she wants, and give her a ridiculous amount of treats (toys, candy, etc.), and this is causing her to be confused, to struggle with our expectations, and express herself negatively. i assure you, we have been addressing these behaviors for quite some time.",3
"co my retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. i fear that she intends to abuse other children and i want to stop it. i have proof of her abuse against me. how do i go about this?. between the ages of 9-11, i took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. if memory serves, i believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that i took lessons with her. the only reason i stopped going to her was because she retired. 

my teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". i won't get into specifics, but i have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

i never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

recently, i found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. i am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and i want to stop it before it's too late.

so my question is: legally, what can i do and what should my course of action be? i don't want money, i just want her stopped.

i have the photographs, but i am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

please walk me through this, because i genuinely don't know what to do, and i'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because i didn't stop it sooner.

edit: i usually think these edits are annoying, but i really want to thank all of the support and everyone for sharing their experiences. turns out feeling lonely/not having friends for a really long time is pretty common. if anyone wants to chat or find a friend, there's tons of people looking for friends here and so am i :d",7
"by naming my password recovery answer as 'dong schlong'. this happened about a week ago. it still gives me shivers.

obviously, i never thought this would happen to me of all people.

i spent a lot of money on the app store and i think they blocked my card and so i had to call them up to restore my account.

a female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. even at this point i had no clue what was coming. until she asked,

""what is your most prized possession?""

i froze. my head goes blank not because i forgot what i had written for the answer, but because i knew exactly what i had written. the answers were all the same, all the time... 'dong schlong'.

i wanted to hang up right then and there, but i knew she was looking at the answer i had written.

so, i mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,

""uh... ^(dong schlong)""

""i'm sorry? you have to speak up sir, i can't hear you well.""

""... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (fuck), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (fucking kill me)""

""dong schlong. thank you, sir.""

i was surprised she didn't crack up or anything and was very professional.

i've sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than 'dong scholong'.

&#x200b;

tl;dr: i wrote my recovery password as 'dong schlong', and i had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, 'dong schlong'.

edit:

holy mother of schlong this blew up... thank you kind sir/ma'am for the shiny silver!

and yes, looking back, i should've definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. but this had never happened to me and i think i just panicked. i'll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.

"in general, women are grosser than men.. i'm a woman. here's my reasoning.

i worked janitorial jobs for almost 10 years, in various settings. banks, doctor's offices, businesses, gas stations, etc. the women's restroom was always, 100% of the time, nastier. things in the toilet i can't even begin to describe. toilet paper everywhere. poop on the walls and the seats. spit and make up on the mirrors. and blood on everything. all the time.

in ten years of cleaning for a living, the grossest thing i saw in a men's restroom, was poop stains in the toilet. i worked for a million dollar company, where everyone dressed up. and had money, and the women destroyed their bathrooms. sometimes i wasn't even sure the things i saw, came out of humans.

secondly, the grossest cars and bedrooms i've been in, were women's. in female friends homes i've seen rotten cheese under the bed, curdled milk on the nightstand. dirty streaked underwear on the floor, dog shit, used condoms, and more.

i've never seen worse than dirty clothes on a man's bedroom floor.

women are far nastier than men.",6
"i told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.. i got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. i didn't tell him all the details, but i told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and i showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. at first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because i told him i'd run away and call the police if he did.

he called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. they talked to us away from eachother and i had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who i told everything real specific. she was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

we went back home with them and i showed the police where my mother kept drugs that i'm pretty sure we're illegal. she wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and i don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs i think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. i think they're gonna look into it though. 

there were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. like a shelter or something. 

i should of done this year's ago, i feel really bad because i could have had my siblings taken better care of. i don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place i'm in now is way cleaner than i'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. they weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. they also weren't very happy with our house i could tell.

i hope we don't have to go back. and i hope it's ok to post this. even tho i don't need advice anymore. thank you to everyone who helped me.",2
"that in 1983 the head of a woman was found in a peat bog in england. a man assumed it belonged to his wife, who he had murdered and dumped in the bog in 1961, and made a full confession. the remains were dated and discovered to be 1750 years old. the man was still convicted of his wife's murder..

"by realizing my history teachers gave me a horribly skewed version of what happened leading up to the civil war.. i had 4 years of rotc in high school and 2 semesters of american history. (2 separate teachers) so, not a history major, but i have absorbed a lot of material on the civil war. and i realized today that it was horseshit and i got hoodwinked.

before that, like most people, when someone asked me why the civil war happened, my answer would have been ""slavery"". and that definitely was an issue. but my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. they gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the north, what europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --there was a lot. and it made sense, because i found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. so they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. again, super plausible. this was all being presented with an attitude of ""now let me tell you what really happened"". 

im six semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the declarations of secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. i had no idea they existed. i read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. they were all about slavery and how it was ""the greatest institution ever conceived"" and that it had to be protected. there's no way this wasn't the forefront issue, after reading those papers. i messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn't remembering wrong and, i wasn't. i told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the secession declarations either. ugh.

reddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong i was. i don't care about people calling me dumb, i'll own that. i just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and i got this...propaganda. i am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. i hope my stupidity is isolated, but i wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don't? 

tl;dr i thought the civil war was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn't, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck.

edit: the fu part of this is that it took me making an ignorant post on a other forum and getting blasted by the reddit community about how completely stupid i was for me to learn about the documents, or the cornerstone speech. which i guess is fair, i dunno. it hurt my feelings, but it shook loose the truth for me.

&#x200b;

my mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. i've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". i say that in quotes because i have no fucking clue who they are. when i'm around they never mention any group names or what ""organization"" they work for or are apart of. because of this i have not had much luck finding out stuff as ""new age cult"" gives to many results to look into.

&#x200b;

this monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. they told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more ""stable"" location within a spiritual community. according to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. i tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. according to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. i've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but i've been unable too. they cut of the internet, phone and tv tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. i'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way i've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. i was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that i will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.

i need to know what the fuck i can do here. my dad has shared custody of me and since monday i've had no contact with him. he is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. i tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. he lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. i'm at a friends house because i was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after i told my parents i wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and i plan to stay here tonight if i can. my parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

i'm so lost right now it makes me sick. i do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and i need to know what the fuck i can do here. can i just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. if my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

edit:

i talked to my mom and told her because i would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times i could see my friend i would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". i got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. he did not agree and was told i didn't want to talk to him. my 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. my sisters dad is going to call cps too and i just got done with my call to them but i wont repeat what they said here. i will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to florida immediately if i don't check in with him or he hears i went back to her. he says that he is already looking into emergency custody (i want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. they both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). i also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. my dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. thanks guys for the advice.",2

updated post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9xps88/update_on_im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how/)

i was going to make this an edit but due to its length, i figured to make it a separate post. i don't even know if this is relevant to this subreddit anymore, but i sincerely apologize if i am in the wrong.

i just wanted to address some common questions, and to clear up some things i've mentioned in the comments briefly. i hope this post is a little more coherent and organized than my previous ones.

but before i do that, i want to thank everyone who sent me a dm, inboxed me, or commented, offering to talk or giving me advice. i've read through all of them, but i haven't gotten around to replying, but regardless, thank you so so soo much. you have no idea how much it actually means to me, and how much i appreciate it. i love you all <3

# quick update:

i texted kyle yesterday and he replied. i asked him how he was feeling. he said he was even more sick than earlier. i said i was too, and i said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). i told him about how i had a volunteer thing at university which i went to and how i nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. but that was it. we didn't talk about much else because he stopped responding.

in addition to this, i haven't called the number my ta gave me because they are only open monday - friday from 8am to 4pm. so, i'm going to be doing that on monday, hopefully.

# my condition:

the exact name for my condition is mayer-rokitansky-küster-hauser syndrome, or mrkh syndrome for short. it affects 1 in every 5000 women. a lot of people, i'm assuming they were trolls, stated that i was a guy or something along those line. just to clarify, i am a woman, i look like a woman physically and i've felt like a woman my whole life. i was genetically born with xx chromosomes. being a woman is not something i doubt.

there are basically 2 types of branches within mrkh. type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. this may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. i have type 1. there are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. i am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# diagnosis:

a lot of people were confused as to why i was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did i find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

the way mkrh works is that it affects internal reproductive organs. this means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. from the outside, i look like a normal female. i have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. i am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. my ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why i am still physically able to look like a female. for me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, i have something called an indentation or 'dimple'. for 18 years of my life, i lived thinking i was just like any other girl. i never once suspected anything wrong.

when i started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. but this was around the time i started to feel like something was wrong. one main reason was that i hadn't started my period, and the second being the fact that i wasn't able to insert a finger inside my vagina. for some reason, at the time, i assumed periods and fingering went together. i thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina ""opened"" and the barrier fell out or something like that. its weird looking back at that now haha.

i went to the doctors one day (this was before i started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. this is probably one of the most common ways women with mrkh find out about it. the doctors simply assumed that i was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. i was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. i was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. the following year, i got my shit together on my own. i joined the wrestling team, track team, and i started doing weight training. as a result of this, i was also eating way more, and i gained a lot of muscle mass. i got my weight up to 120lbs. when i still hadn't gotten my period, i went back to the doctors. they still didn't take it too seriously, telling me that some women don't get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. i had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. i didn't feel like everything was normal, so i switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. needless to say, i was getting tired of blood tests because i knew they didn't show anything. one doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but i think that was circumstantial. prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that i had breast discharge which is something i had never experienced before in my life. some how, i can't exactly remember which doctor, i ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to ""reset"" my biological functions and induce a period. i diligently took the bc pills every day. nothing happened. this is when i thought, ""is it just me or does healthcare in canada suck?"".

then another doctor suggested i get a pelvic ultrasound done. this is when they found the issue. the poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn't even exist. the doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. she stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom i had mrkh. she said according to the ultrasound i had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). she literally didn't even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. i walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. his response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and i could hear him. and then he said, ""its okay, just forget it"". i came home, and i did some googling and started to learn more about mrkh. i had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and i texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. i also added that if it changed anything between us, that i would understand, and i wouldn't hold it against him. as much as i might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something i really needed at the time.

after the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a sickkids hospital in downtown toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. they started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. they had me get an mri done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an mri. i also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). doctors aren't allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. i ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because i didn't have one. the look on their face was hilarious as i'm sure they probably never heard of my condition either. after i met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, i was properly informed that i did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but i was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. i was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. they had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. the depth of it was about 3mm deep. it was actually quite painful, and i hated doctors by this point anyways.

# family situation:

my parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are highly taboo. everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn't know english well so most of the time when i went to the doctors, i went with my dad. it was very weird and awkward. the few times my dad refused to go with me, i went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

after my last appointment with sickkids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. my dad took those from me and threw them out, saying i didn't need them. they also asked if i would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that i didn't it. going to therapy at the hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. i can't drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which i don't particularly mind doing if it helps me, but i don't have time due to school. i actually got a letter from the hospital in september about a pretty cool mrkh conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. i really really wanted to go. but again, it was far. i figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, i could definitely bus there. the event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. it was unrealistic for me to go. so then i told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. they'll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" i tried arguing that it was exactly the opposite of that, and that they want to inform you that you are women despite the lack of certain organs. they responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) i had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

i had someone telling me that i need to stand up to my parents. my parents aren't the issue, but my dad is. unfortunately, due to the circumstances that i don't particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something i refuse to do. i am well aware of the shitty situation i am in. i know they are being abusive, in more than one way. i've thought long and hard about it, and i've come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. i'm not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we're like a normal family. i've seriously taken everyone's well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# surgery:

i had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. in my first post, somewhere in the comments, i believe i said something along the lines of ""im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now"", as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why i can't get surgery yet. lucky for me, i live in canada and i have health insurance! surgery is definitely an option for me. but due to my family situation, they believe that i wont need surgery until after i get married because i mean its not like i'm going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# additional comments:

1. a lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that i could look into doing anal. it's all about personal preference, and i hate it. its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. i can look into the asexual community, but i am not asexual. i may not be able to satisfy my needs, but i do have a pretty high sex drive, and i do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. i don't know if i would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. a lot of people had a lot to say about how i handled the situation. some saying i did the right thing, and others saying i did it too soon. honestly, i haven't figured out the right way to go about it. i have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. i once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""aren't you surprised i still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" i was so taken aback by it, i didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. someone said that ""if a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, i'm sure its an important part of their life but it's a huge first date turn off. so he shouldn't disclose it on the first date"". true, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his ibs. i didn't disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was relevant to what was happening. i evaluated the situation i was in with kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so i had to tell him. agree or not, first date material or not, i'm going to stand by with what i did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. i am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest i do that, but you don't really know what its like until you're actually in the situation yourself. i don't want to publicly display it to guys i'm not interested in, nor to those who aren't interested in me. i know guys who also use those dating apps, and i don't want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. the guy i ended up calling on tuesday night, after i left kyle's apartment, he knows about my condition. he has told me that it wouldn't bother him. i had a lot of messages telling me that i shouldn't friend-zone him, and that i should give him a chance. here is the real reason why i'm not attracted him nor why i would never ever give him a chance: he's basically doing nothing with his life. he's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. whereas i on the other hand, i work part-time, i study my ass off in school, and i make time to do extra curricular stuff. i also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. but i treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. i'm not saying i'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am i saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. i'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and i'm not into that. in addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **""the other guy""**. he was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because ""he was lonely"". i was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, i am. there is no way i am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. i think one of the main reasons i even turned to reddit in the first place was because i am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and i don't want them finding out. there was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me i can't find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications i got.

this is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. i hope i answered some questions. i really do appreciate all the support i got. thank you, and take care everyone <3

edit: i'm only doing this to feel better about myself: kyle replied. ""i definitely do not want to get involved"". fuck you, kyle. if y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. i welcome it with open arms. 

edit: i think i forgot to address this earlier. for those of you asking whether i can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. my clitoris is underdeveloped. stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? i don't know. i haven't tried. 

edit: guys. i. can. still. pee. i have a urethra. you do not put a guys pee-pee in the same place you pee from. simply anatomy. ",8
"if businesses only have to pay taxes on profit, not revenue. then i should only have to pay taxes after i've paid all my bills and rent.. businesses do not pay taxes on their gross revenue, they get to go to the irs and say, ""well this is what we paid paid our vendors, paid our staff and our bills, so we dont pay tax on this"". great, so it allows business to not have to pay taxes before they've taken out the costs of doing business.

regular joe however, pays taxes on their gross income which is massively unfair compared to businesses, my rent, food, bills and transport costs are also my cost of doing business. they are not optional, without those i cannot earn the money to make the salary i am paid.

the irs wouldnt have extra work to do either, they already look at tax submissions of businesses and see what their revenue and deducted business expenses were, they could do that for you and me too.

edit: to clarify, my criticism isn't that businesses should be taxed more, that's not what i want. people should be taxed less using the same deductions.",6
"by letting my son take my wife's menstrual cup for show and tell. my wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. sometime over the weekend i noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. i asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it's versatility- over the next few days it helped the paw patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. it came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. i loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

fast forward to this morning and as we're getting ready for school alexa reminds us that it's show and tell today at school. so my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. i pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. my son looks happy so i figure he's not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he's proud of. 

our conversation:

teacher: ben's show and tell was...interesting. 

me: yea! it's cool right? we've been playing with that thing for days. 

teacher: uh, mr. scott, do you know what that is?

i start to panic- oh shit it's not a toy...

teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

i get confused. 

teacher notes my confusion: it's um, used to collect menstrual blood...

i'm still confused...

teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

me: it just...stays in there? 

she nods. 

me: are you sure? i don't think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

we're both clearly uncomfortable. 

me: alright then.....so where do i get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


my wife laughed hysterically when we told her. my son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

tl:dr thought my wife's menstrual cup was a toy and my son and i played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

edit: wow!!!! i cannot believe this got so much attention. i'm glad everyone got a good laugh. a bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn't know it was me, though. 

my wife has been reading the comments and insisted that i clarify that i know all about her cycle. we are ttc currently and, just as it was with our son, i know when she's ovulating, i track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. i grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices i was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. i was also confused by it ""fitting"" because, like i said, this device helped save a chickoletta over the weekend. i've seen a tampon- they're much slimmer than this cup is. my wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn't even feel it's presence after it's im position. 

i'd like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife's approval.",4

i took the advice in the comments and confronted him in front of his family by making a „joke"". at first there was silence till his brother made up a fake laughter to calm the situation as you literally could feel the tension. my husband just gave me a poisonous look and didn't say anything. later at home it became a huge fight were he hold a speech about his „role as man"", „his proud"" and that i were unable to be a „good ,caring wife who supports her husband"".
as i didn't shut up this time he told me to fuck off. i took a few things of mine and went to my parents'. i can't believe that he changed to this person as i met him as a open minded man. and i can't believe we were trying to have a baby together. i'm glad i could opened my eyes before it went that far. i'm going to divorce. my parents are thinking that it's a temporary situation but i don't wanna risk a life in abuse and handcuffs.

"by teaching my 4 year old about static electricity. so it was rather cold today and i put some nice, thick wool socks on my 4 year old son.  after running around a bit today, he came and gave me a hug.... zaaap.  

i explained to him that he's got to pick up his feet because dragging them on the carpet will build up a ""shock"".  my son looks at me and says ""like pikachu?""

a bit of background.  a few months ago i discovered that disney now has the full run of all pokemon episodes.  like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  my son and i have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  my wife and i decided to get a switch as a family gift for christmas, along with let's go pikachu.  for my son's birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  

so a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his pikachu plushie.  drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing frostpunk and says ""donder shok!!"" while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  

as he runs away, clutching his plushie, all i can say to my wife was ""i think pikachu's been teaching him some tricks"".  she was not amused.  



tl;dr - pikachu taught my son thunder shock.  my wife is not happy about this development.

"as a reaction to butt worms (almost certainly nsfw). this is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.

also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

for background: at some point in my childhood, i developed pin-worms. in the interest of science, i must admit that i don't know for certain that i had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that i had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

i'm afraid that i don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all i remember is that as a young child i walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and i don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

fast forward a decade and a half: i am living on my own. single. re-acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone i am still close to refers to as ""she-who-must-not-be-named"". i don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....i had worms. my butt was beyond-normally itchy. sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. the confirmation came when i showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

i hoped they would go away. i showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. but every morning, i would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

i was horrified, but i made an appointment at my local clinic. when i told the nurse over the phone that i thought i had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. she said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

i went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly south-east indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

i was already frustrated, but i waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. later i drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before i would get results.

in the meantime, i remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.

i would like to say that as a liberal american male, i wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that i did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, i dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what i had done.

now to add: i had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. we had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; i wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and i found ourselves showering. my hand drifted down to my butt-crack and i realized i \*needed\* to share my story with her, despite fears that i would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. so i spurted it out: ""uhm, so yeah, i...uh...think i have butt worms....""

she was so practical about it. she asked to see. i pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""see,"" i said, embarrassed. ""worms.""

...

""that's toilet paper"", she replied.

""w...what?""

""yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""that's toilet paper.""

everything fell into place. about a month ago, when finances got tight, i swapped my normal tp roll with dollar store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after i wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

my relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . my shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

tldr: i spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because i bought cheap toilet paper.

"trying to force someone into atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into christianity.. i am one of those atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. i would honestly rather just let people be. i don't think i am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. i have been seeing several threads on reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. albert einstein was a jew, does being an atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? no.

and it also makes me cringe when atheists try to force religious people into atheism. if we are going to strongly condemn christians trying to force others into christianity, we should condemn atheists trying to force atheism on to other people.

if it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

edit: thanks for bringing einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically jewish, growing up in a jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. that being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. isaac newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) christian. if you don't want to use scientists as an example, james madison, who wrote the bill of rights that is idolized by many, was also christian. the conclusion i am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.",6

 then the patriot act came thanks to cunt ass bush jr. (now remade to as another act to hide it). 

since then, all corporations have been able to listen in, follow, track, and sell data (our lives and tracking) without even asking us if it is okay.

say you have to confirm to use your phone, whether it be android or apple. if you don't agree then you can't use the phone. this is highly immoral in that only a few phone makers exist. this is called monopolizing. by having all the phone companies do the same is racqueteering.

"for every guy that ""missed a hint,"" there is another guy who misinterpreted a hint and violated someone's boundaries accidentally.. inspired by reading through this askreddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/askreddit/comments/dqn66a/girls_what_was_the_most_obvious_hint_you_dropped/

many stories in there about hints girls dropped for guys. some of them i read and think, ""i could see someone doing this in a truly platonic way.""

personally, i have an experience i think about often. a coworker (girl) invited me over to get drunk on tequila and sleepover. when it came time to go to bed, i asked where i should sleep and she said ""well you can sleep on the couch or you can come to the bed with me.""

i elected for the bed.

however i wasn't sure what her intentions were, and we had been drinking, so i didn't initiate anything and she didn't either. to this day i still don't know if it was a missed opportunity or a correct interpretation.

my opinion: is it really ""missed hints,"" or is it ""fear of misinterpreting and violating someone?""",6

"if i quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? i would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. ex wife as well.. so years and years of backstory here. ex wife has bpd and life with her has been a continuous struggle. we are in the middle of a divorce because while she's lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. but she crossed that line and enough was enough. divorce is bitter and ugly. 

for financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. i implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. the both blew me off and ""yeah yeahed"" me for almost a year. ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. then getting mad at me when i said i had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

i've had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. on a lark i called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in nm. he said i'm hired. i talked to my partner and he'd gladly buy my half of the business. with the 50% id have to give my ex wife i could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. i could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

kids would be cut off. i wouldn't be able to afford any help. they have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. but they'd have to grow up and fast.

i would go to a cafe before i started work for a half hour and have a latte and have time to myself. my friend was there typing on a laptop. we started talking and i found out he came every day to write a book in his spare time and he was in the publishing business.

i have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend loves paydays, the peanut candy bars. there is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. i wasn't sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. so i decided to ask reddit.

most of the replies said that it shouldn't be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let's go for it.

she gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. it wasn't quite as bad as i thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. but after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and i could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

i pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her i'd be right back and ran to the bathroom. this obviously made her very self conscience. i was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when i came back i looked like will smith from hitched when he eats the seafood. 

i had to explain to her that i was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. she told me i didn't ever have to do it again, so i guess there's a silver lining to the story.

tldr: i have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.

my grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and i intend to keep  my word.

but i do feel really guilty that my father just spends his money as it's coming in because he's relying on money he won't get.

i also found out my dad is in a lot of debt.

for not telling him?",3
"caught my girlfriend cheating and i cannot cope please help. so long story short i found texts on my(18m) gf(19) phone tonight texting her friend things like ""he pounded my shit"" ""i got some of the best dick last night"" and ""omg it was so good, i couldn't walk last night""

i'm disgusted.  it was her ex, whom i've always felt inferior too like she just hadn't gotten over him even after over a year.

i'm distraught.  i don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  my two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.  my family and i don't even get along nor communicate much.  i lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

she's really sorry.  i saw her crying when she didn't know i could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  i feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  i had to do it.  i told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

but fuck this sucks.  i have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and i just don't know how to cope with this.  i can't eat.  i can't sleep and i have class in the morning.  i keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and i'm just disgusted.  i'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  i know in a while i'll be ok but i just don't know how to get from part a to part b.

please help




edit:  wow.  i don't even know what to say.  guys thank you so much for the overwhelming support.  i get a new notification telling me to be strong literally every three seconds.

i finally fell asleep at 7 am and there were like 40 comments on this.  i woke up and there are over 800 beautiful people telling me to be strong.  thank you so much.  reddit is such a beautiful place.  in the strangest way, i feel really capable of surmounting this today as opposed to yesterday.  you guys definitely played a part in that.

this is the kind of stuff that makes me remember not everyone sucks lmao.  keep up being great in life guys :)

thank you from the bottom of my heart!


edit2:  jesus guys!  you're all a blessing!  i just finished class and i've been getting notifications every three seconds!  going to do my best to get back to everyone.

i am doing much, much better.  i'm feeling freed rather than sorry for myself now.  thank you all.

by far the most frequent advice was to hit the gym.  i'm going to dinner rn but i'm hitting the iron directly after!

on top of this awesome wave of support from all of you, i've had a few good things happen today that are just making this so much better:

-  my job app for a 20$ an hour job teaching sat prep was praised for ""outstanding qualifications""

-  i got invited to participate in drug research here at my school

- and my fucking package arrived that i've been waiting on for a week!

-also one of my friends who cut me off reached out to me

i'm doing well, thank you all, you're all a gift, much love from my corner of the internet, you're all worth a platinum in my eyes!

cheers!

"update - for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?. a few months ago, i posted this post( https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/achoyx/aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting_to_go_to/) asking if i was an asshole for not wanting to take my girlfriend out to restaurants. it blew up. it ended up on twitter. people shared it to facebook.

the general consensus was, yes, that i am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. a couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. more than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. 

well.

after i posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. she started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.

then one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, ""do you seriously fucking think that i *actually like* eating at olive garden?""

guys, she saw the post. she was *furious*. 

she doesn't like olive garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. i was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, ""she never developed a taste for pasta, she's latino, do i ever see her make pasta? no. a meal isn't complete without rice. you don't know me at all.""

she yelled about olive garden for a solid twenty minutes. it wasn't just about olive garden, but it was a lot about olive garden.

long story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. she ""loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage"" from me for her own personal betterment.

 so, yeah.

tl;dr: i ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. i didn't take her out on dates and i didn't pay enough attention. i would do anything to fix everything.

edit: to clarify a few things

1. i didn't post on april first.

2. i say that she yelled about ""mostly olive garden"" because she did. she was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over olive garden, where the kids are catered to.

3. she did not call herself latino. she calls herself latinx, but i thought latino would be less confusing. guess it just made me look like a dick.",3

"by farting during mass and making the priest laugh. this actually happened about an hour ago. i'm just now starting to come out of my humiliating shock.

so...i'm sitting at mass listening to the reading when i feel a slight grumble in my stomach,

""uh oh...gas.""

no biggie, this has happened before, i'll either wait for a song and let it go or wait for the homily (sermon for you protestants) and sneak over into the bathroom and take care of business. but alas, my body had other plans.

we stood to chant the psalm, the pressure is building, i'm starting to panic, not sure if i can hold it. we finish the psalm and the church goes to sit and just as i land on the pew...

it happened!

now this wasn't a quick fart, it was one of those that lasted a few seconds, a cheek rumbler, and the sound was amplified by the solid oak pew. it created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as gabriel's trumpet.

the church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, i looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. at this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...

the priest stands up at his chair, says ""i'm sorry...i'm sorry...i can't..."" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, i can hear him laughing.

at this point i decide it's a total loss, i shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.

tl;dr  farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now i gotta find another church. ",4
"i (29 f) am letting my baby be adopted so i can give him a better more stable life with two parents. after he is born i will be going to a mental health facility to try to get myself better. do up think it would be appropriate for me to write him a letter to explain this?. i am bipolar and dont feel that i can care for a child, especially by myself. i dont want to live with my parents forever.

"neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp. my boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. i've done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door. my front door is really recessed from the street due to my lawn and hidden by my porch, so the ramp isn't very visible from the street. i painted it to match the house as well.

few months ago, a new family moved across the street and the wife's never been very friendly with me like my other neighbors are, which i chalked up to her being shy or whatever. however, recently i got a note taped up to my door that said she's going to sue if i don't take the ramp down, as it's an eyesore and ""reduces curbside value."" i have no idea what she means since you can't see the thing unless you know what to look for and really get up in my property, as confirmed by neighbors and friends.

she refused to answer the door when i went over to talk to her about it. i'm trying not to lose my temper over this but it's hard. there's been many times my boyfriend has been screwed over by so-called ""handicap accessible"" places, i don't want my home to be one of them. does she have any sort of case? i'm in washington.",2

i must admit that i was really homophobic and racist growing up. that was how i was raised. but when i moved to america, i met my wife and she helped me a lot. she helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. i owe that to my wife.

yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. so we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. it took some time to sink in, but i understood. when i asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. she asked me if i was fine with it and i told her that i had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. i must admit that i felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

after that, i asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. she told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. i'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. so i started to get ready to prepare it. 

at this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. and when i came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. my daughter was crying and i was really shocked. i asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. she told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

i asked my wife to leave, because i was really angry. after my wife left i told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and i'll stand by her. my daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

now, my wife refuses to talk to me. she told me that she will be back only if i agree to help my daughter become straight. idk what to make out of this. i'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. i love both of them very much and i'd like to help diffuse this situation. can i get some advice here?",8

and no, there is no advantage to renting. they don't service modems rented differently than one you bought

edit: to address everyone saying that their isp ""requires"" use of the company's router, or that techs cost money:

ive seen reps say the isp modem rental was required, thats pushy sales tactics -most of the time. just tell them emphatically you want to buy your own. **the router/modem model is important, make sure you ask your isp what model/combo to buy**

techs are no cost when its first installed because its the outside lines, into your house. the same goes for internet issues. you again, emphatically tell customer care that the issue is not with the hardware but with the wiring outside/to your box. they are pushy, like the car repair business. they know most people dont know better, so they embellish on facts and swindle a lot of people out of money due to ignorance

"rover.com dog sitter lost my dog, hindered his recovery and damaged my work contract in the process.. i hired a well reviewed rover.com(https://rover.com) dog sitter to watch my dog on fri in order for me to work on a contract out of the city. i dropped my dog off at the sitter's house at noon on fri, and at 8:30pm he sends me a message letting me know that my dog had escaped. (something about his girlfriend and a open door) i break my work contract and race back to the city to start looking for him, and posted his info on several social media sources to get as much exposure as possible. i find out through bunz and fb that my dog was sighted about a kilometer away at 6:30pm, so this guy waited several hours before letting me know that my dog was missing.

i get into the city and start looking on foot. he informs me that he has called the police and tas (toronto animal services) and has ordered a set of missing posters to put up in the neighbourhood trough rover. he then tells me that he has a bunch of friends and family canvassing the neighbourhood looking for him. great right? this is where things get unpleasant.

it's -10c outside and as it gets later and my search gets wider i realize that i'm the only one looking for my dog. i call rover.com(https://rover.com) repeatedly and they say that all they can do on their end is encourage the sitter to go out and look, but apart from that their hands are tied. i get a tip from facebook that a dog similar to mine was brought in to tas, but i needed to call them for a more accurate description. i call tas when they open on sat morning at 8am, and discover that it isn't my dog. at that point they inform me that they never received a missing dog report for my dog the night before, and that i would have to submit one myself. (+12h after he went missing) this is the first confirmed lie from this dog sitter.

i continue my search throughout the morning with no leads, i double back into the neighbourhood and still don't see any missing posters or anyone else searching. i finally get a tip off to his location through facebook and catch up with my dog at a park that he is semi-familiar with around lunch time. this is after 17h straight of walking in -10c weather. i covered every street & alleyway in a 3 sq kilometer area because i was scared to death that my dog was going to get hit by a car and/or freeze to death. i couldn't stand the thought of going home without him.

i speak to rover.com(https://rover.com) again, and on a hunch ask for the missing poster order number and location. it turns out they were never collected from the staples that printed them. so this guy never had any posters in his possession and was never distributing them. i have them now as evidence.

&#x200b;

emotions aside, is there any course of action i can take to deal with this person? by lying about the search, the posters and the tas report he delayed valuable search tools that i could have procured myself and used in the search immediately. i also lost $1000 by breaking this work contract and have documentation to that effect. 

this guy really should not have any animal in his care, and pretending to go through the motions is worse than simple negligence like leaving a door unsecured. i'm at a loss for how to proceed. (if at all) 

edit: to clarify i did eventually find my dog, he's safe but it was a hellish experience.

"my daughter left daycare and ran into the street and nobody noticed until a stranger found her. (wi) just started work for the first time since having my daughter two years ago. 

left her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers. 

on the second day i was driving and saw her walking down the street several blocks from the daycare with a woman i had never seen before in my life. 

i jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she'd found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (i have no reason to doubt the woman's intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

i drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

i was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a good samaritan that i just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her. 

this occurred on friday and i have yet to receive a response. i would like to know if i can take legal action against them for endangering  my daughter and if i can alert the other parents as to what occurred so they can keep their little ones safe, without opening myself up to slander charges. thanks.

"by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards. this actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. in 2016 i started using tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. i had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. my profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of ""not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices"" and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

fast forward to march of 2017 and i matched with someone. after a couple of one-off messages that don't really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. a couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. this all sounds great. except for two problems.

the first problem is that i have a beard in all of my photos. and even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. my facial hair is like if someone shaved a guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. if i grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. wiry and sparse. it's not good. for six years, i'd still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. but for some reason, the week before we started talking, i had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. i just wanted to know what it looked like. the answer? not. fucking. good. at this point, i was 27 but still looked young for my age. shave the beard off and i look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. really fucking awkward.

so i pulled up to her house and text before i got out of my car to say, ""hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it's just me."" luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as i expected. all good so far.

i went inside and we end up hanging out all night. she cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. she was blown away by the fact that i'd never seen labyrinth and demanded we watch it. we ended up watching three movies that night. for labyrinth, i was about five feet away on the couch. for young frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. for the third movie (which i can't remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. and this is where the second problem comes in. 

after my breakup in 2016 and realizing i'd been battling lifelong depression, i started taking antidepressants. one of the super fun side effects of ssris is that it can be really hard to climax. like, try as you might, nothin. dust. moths. nothin. thanks, big pharma.

and so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like ""holy fuck i might have a heart attack. why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and ""what about this position?"" ""ouch!"" ""oh my god, i need a towel. so. much. sweat. i can't see."" we were in the basement on a large three piece couch. you know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. well at one point i tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. a bruised ass. a bent dick. a lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

if this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven't done any cardio in your fucking life. and jesus christ the sweat. so fucking slippery and gross. this wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. this is bog monsters come to life sweat. this is ace ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. at one point our chests become suction cupped together. i could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn't felt like it was going to explode. and the chafing. fuck. no matter how ready either of y'all are when you start out, after two hours, it's gonna wear off. we both felt like we'd attacked our bits with sandpaper. my poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. this was no climactic movie sex scene. this was a john waters film come to life. 

well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. it's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. we went outside for a smoke and at this point it's about 6am. i'm wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she's only in a bathrobe. we sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (she had just moved back home before finding a new place). so not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now i get to meet her mom for the first time! great! i'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. life is fucking weird.

well, the reason i am posting this on march 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we're engaged to be married on march 14th of 2020. our sex life is far better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. i mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

tl;dr i met up with a tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. now we're engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




edit: just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! i am still wholly undecided if i will ever show her this post. it's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. we'll see though. and thank you so much for the gold and silver! did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. and for those asking, i've changed my dosage on my ssri and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! and also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. he didn't pan out. within three months, her mom got hit up by several tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

edit2: i guess now i probably have to show this to my fiancee to which she will reply, ""i have no idea what any of that means. good for you, i guess?"" i still love her.

edit3: a few of y'all keep asking, ""why in tifu?"" well, let me tell ya, if i had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. even worse than my breakup the year before. not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? yeah, that sucked. just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't suck asssss on the whole. i mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. thanks for coming to my tedtalk

final edit: for real y'all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. i told her about this post when i got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when i read it to her. we spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift drive-thru theater setup",4
"update i'm pregnant and being investigated by dcs.. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5smsoi/indiana_im_pregnant_and_being_investigated_by_dcs/) is my original post. when i made it, i was advised to get a lawyer right away. i was also advised that indiana's dcs doesn't investigate pregnant women who don't already have kids, and that the woman claiming to be a social worker might be an imposter.

i contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. he seemed to agree that something was very fishy. to make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with dcs. 

i'm still in complete shock.

we went straight to the police. they're taking this very seriously. i can't give a lot of details because it's an ongoing investigation, but she seems to have been a very skilled/well-researched liar. i never would have known anything was amiss without the advice of this subreddit and the intervention of my attorney. i feel like a complete idiot, but the instinct to cooperate unquestioningly when faced with an intimidating ""authority figure"" is strong.

"my 20f boyfriend 27m did something concerning during sex and i'm not sure if he just ""didn't know"", or if it was intentional.... together for one year and we live together. otherwise happy and loving/respectful relationship. this post might be tmi but i don't feel comfortable seeking advice about this irl so i'm asking here how other people would feel about it.

so, we have a good sex life and i have felt happy and satisfied with it. i think he's generous in bed and cares about my own pleasure, i would not describe him as selfish and only caring about himself...until this incident. however, he's been asking me to try anal for a long time. i kept saying no and explaining my reasoning for it, which was that i was scared it would hurt and because it takes way more prep/care than piv sex. 

**here's the tmi part, i apologize**he had never tried it before. he's been fingering me back there during sex and i was okay with that, but a few days ago i was laying on my stomach during sex and he stuck it in my ass without warning or asking. i was a little drunk but knew it felt off and then it just really hurt. i told him it hurt and he said to try and relax. 

i did try to relax but it hurt really bad and i asked him like 3x to pull out before he finally did. at which point he apologized. but afterwards he did it again, and i asked him to stop again and he said to ""wait because he was about to finish"" so i allowed it to happen. i just waited til he came while in some pain and it honestly sucked.

 i'm not gonna say i was raped because i blame myself for the whole thing, but it was painful, not enjoyable, and he thinks it was great. there was no lube or anything so obviously it did not feel good for me. he wasn't rough about it but still wtf? how can you not understand that you can't just stick your dick raw into somebody's ass? it's not like a vagina which gets wet on it's own.**it makes me feel like he knew but didnt care.**

i just feel uncomfortable with the whole situation and i am not sure what to do about it. how should i have this conversation with him? what should i do about it? how would you react?",8
"for sending my son to school in a dress. my son started second grade last week. i get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

he's got a twin sister. i told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. my son picked one up and said ""i want to wear this."" i'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. i'm pretty politically neutral so while i wouldn't say i was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that i could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

i figured ok, i wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so i shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

i drop him off and get to work. three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. he was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

my wife is irate asking how i couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and i was setting our son up to fail. so is just about everyone else i've run this by. my wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and i was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because i was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

at the time, i truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that i put my son in harm's way so now i'm not sure whether i made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. aita",3
"update dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. am i wrong to be angry?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

you guys are right. i can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. i resent this man so much. i can't stand the sight of him. 

after i posted yesterday, i was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. to no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. i picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. i heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but i didn't bring up any of our hardships. my mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. i did, i forgave him but that doesn't mean i need to have a relationship with him anymore. again, my family protested that i'm being cruel and heartless. i'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. i told them i would not be present at any family events if he was there.

my sister shouted at me claiming ""he is our dad. you asshole"". yes he is, to which i replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. i told them i had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. my sisters need to return the iphone's that are on contract as i am cancelling those. driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that i pay for. these are dad's responsibilities now. ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

i have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. i need a break.

i'm done. i'm done taking over dad's role. i'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. i'm 25 and i need to live my own life now. i don't think this will burn bridges. it's just a wake up call for them.

edit: i'm not going to ghost or abandon them. they need to become independent now. 

edit:  i'm reading all the comments. i know i have acted like a jerk. i just need some time to collect my thoughts. i might update later.",8
"update i (28m) think my girlfriend (26f) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.. link to previous post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=jqrwkq4d&sh=e1753ed8)

i finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. a lot of things that i never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

as soon as she opened the door to our apartment, i could tell that she was already starting to cry. seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because i didn't want to put her in that position. 

i had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

we sat down, there were lots of tears. i thought i would be bitter, angry and that i would be screaming at her the whole time but i felt disappointed instead. 

i told her that i saw the messages and explained how i ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

she kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

then i told her that we go more way back than they ever did. i was there through her lowest point, i helped her get up.

she admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

i saw it coming, i had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. at that point, i was full on crying. i can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. it still is now. 

i remember telling her that i was done, that whatever we had was over. she kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, i don't think i ever will. i can't tolerate people who cheat.

by that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

when i posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. his place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. he'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that i can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

we both agreed that i don't mention him in this post. i'm glad that i really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

it's almost 3am, i'm heartbroken as ever but i'm trying my best. i'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. i'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

to all my aussie mates,  if you live near/around chapel hill, let me know! 

america, you were great but now it's time to come home. thanks for the help everyone.

edit: i'm crying again, not because i got cheated on but because i realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. i almost can't believe i looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. i am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

i may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but i gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

other than that, i am feeling better. it still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? she made her choice so i made mine. 

i woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that i shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

it sucks that i may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. i thanked them and said that although i believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so i junked it straight away. 

i miss her like crazy. i know it will take a lot of time to heal me but i guess i can wait. 

ps. i'll message my newfound aussie friends when i go through all the comments. exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but i'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

"ma a restaurant manager purposefully switched out my celiac boyfriend's non-gluten meal with a normal one due to her disbelief that he was intolerant. so i wrote about this last night just after it happened on another subreddit, and was advised by many of the comments to post here for some clarity on what recourse we could actually seek from this.

i won't be writing out the whole incident again in as much detail as before, but if anyone reads my earlier post and thinks i've missed out something crucial, i'll be happy to edit the post.

my boyfriend and i went out for lunch yesterday at a restaurant we have dined at before. my boyfriend is a diagnosed celiac and has been for many years, and when this place was recommended to us originally we were told the restaurant has specific gluten free items, and a specific area where such food was prepared to avoid cross contamination. we had a great time, and checked online before going back again yesterday and saw there were no complaints about people being 'glutened'. we arrived and ordered our meals, with my boyfriend specifically ordering a gluten free appetizer and entree, something that the waitress stated would come with a different sauce than advertised as the usual sauce was made in the general area of the kitchen and as such could be contaminated.

we have no issues until the entrees come, when my boyfriend is served a dish of pasta with the advertised sauce. the waitress thinks that there's been a mix up in the kitchen, and comes back a minute later to say that someone else has received his gluten free pasta and the kitchen were rushing out a new order. she said she'd comp our appetizers and try to get us a free dessert, something she'd have to check with the shift manager on first. we see her go over to someone we assume is the manager, and then minutes later the manager storms over and asks us what kind of scam we're pulling. she says that the pasta was definitely gluten free, and we tell her that because of my boyfriend's celiacs we were told that the normal sauce wasn't safe and were waiting on a new dish with a new sauce. she started to complain about fad eating and sensitive customers (something we attributed to us being young and therefore 'millennials'). the waitress came over with the new dish with the new sauce, but the manager snatched it from her and started to walk it back into the kitchen saying that the 'precious table' couldn't be served something that she hadn't checked. she came back a few minutes later with what we assumed was the same dish and wouldn't give it over to my boyfriend initially, sarcastically asking if she wasn't us to drag away the chef from their job and tell us ourselves it was safe. we said it was fine, and rushed to finish so we could get out of there, probably finishing our meals in about 10 minutes.

we flagged down our original waitress and asked for the check. she was a little while, and when she came back to us she looked like she'd seen a ghost. she told us that she'd gone back to the kitchen to check on another order, and noticed a pasta dish that looked exactly like the one my boyfriend had eaten sitting on the side. she asked if it needed to go out, and was told that it was the one the manager had brought back about 15 minutes before. the waitress said that she thought it had been brought back out to the customer, but was told that the manager had only come in and asked the chef working with pasta dishes to simply drain some normal, gluten-containing pasta and serve it with the gluten free sauce (my boyfriend had ordered a tortellini style dish and there was a similar one on the regular menu, so he wouldn't have noticed by appearance or taste alone).

the waitress had comped all of the food on our check, but i insisted that we paid for my dishes, and tipped her well over the average, just in case she was penalised for the manager's mistakes. she went above and beyond what was necessary by telling us the truth to help us in preparing for my boyfriend's future 'glutened' state.

my boyfriend started having a reaction just before we got home, and spent the rest of the evening locked in the bathroom having a serious response to eating a whole bowl of gluten. as of this morning the worst is over, but he is still having serious stomach pains that will be occurring for the next few weeks at the very least.

on my original post, i was given many different types of advice; i was told to both post and not post a scathing review, to sue and not sue the restaurant, and to get the police involved over a 'poisoning' incident or just go all vigilante on the manager. as i have been looking after my boyfriend all night, i have not been able to research any further, legal ways of dealing with this. as a note, my boyfriend has not and will not be going to the er or doctor about this - we already have everything we could possibly need to manage this, and it would simply be wasting time and money. however, if people advise that we need medical 'proof', we will be happy to pursue that.


tl;dr - my celiac boyfriend was purposely 'glutened' by an irate manager who didn't believe he needed a specialist meal, who and what should we pursue to get this manager fired and the restaurant investigated?",2
"updatefired for being fat. update to: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bx4q0p/fired_for_being_fat_ct/   

i posted this 2 weeks ago and a lot has happened. something happened before i could go any further with the lawyer i spoke to.

the monday following the incident i was asked to come speak with a vp of hr i'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. when i walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which i was told was part of legal. what i didn't realize, is my friend who i mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though i told him to keep it secret). this information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. i was asked to explain exactly what happened, who i told, and asked a lot of questions. everything i said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when i told them i was in touch with a lawyer. they had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

this is the holy shit part. they say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt i would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if i wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. they also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. i took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. btw i'm not stupid, i know they did this so i wouldn't take any legal action against them, but i love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. i also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

there's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and i finally have an office with a door i can actually close! i'm in the field a lot less now, so i guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now i don't interact face to face nearly as much as i used

hi all. first off, i want to apologize for not responding to every single post reply or pm. i am genuinely touched by the sheer amount of support i received and i spent quite a few hours crying my eyes out as i read your messages and well wishes.

the night after i wrote my original post, i wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/witchy_woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

""dear \wife's name\,

i love you more than you can imagine and the most i want in this world is for you to be happy. i understand that as a man i probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. i'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. i honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. however, i want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. i'm ready to talk whenever you are.

with all my love,

\my name\""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

i put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. the next morning (march 16th), i woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed oj. when i walked into the bedroom with her food, i saw her reading my letter. when she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. full on, niagara falls level crying. i hugged her tighter, told her ""i love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. i honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. it could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, i didn't care. when she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud i was when i heard those words. she then asked me if we could go on a trip to japan because in her words ""i really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

i was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. she's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels i saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. we just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. we have a 5am uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

we're not quite out of the tunnel yet, but we can see the light at the end.

"i m 32 ruined christmas and i have no regrets.. is anyone else's family this dysfunctional? every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years i was the one who blew up for the first time. 

long story short, i'm half-korean/half-white. my mom is korean. my dad side is white. so we only have my dad's side here in the us. for years, i watched my some of my dad's side speak down to my mom. they never invite her to things. me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. to be frank, i don't care how i'm treated. every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it's only 2-3 times a year. we repeat the process and don't expect much from these family members. my mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. my white grandma is 80 and she's the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

three times today i watched a family member (aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn't speak english and shut her down over simple questions like ""where should i sit?"". i watched my mom quietly recoil and i couldn't stand to see it again. this aunt does it the most and i finally blew up. i yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. i told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. to stop speaking to my mom (who's lived in the us for 35 years) like she doesn't speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. i watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

my aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. as she was leaving i walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom's yearly gift to her. i said  ""for 30 years i watched my mom give you a gift every year. i watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. i've never seen you treat her with the same"".  she didn't say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

before i left, i apologized to everyone and explained why i was upset. everyone was shocked how mad i got. i felt like everyone understood why i was mad.  prior to this (around thanksgiving) i spoke to some family members about how i was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. which they have been trying to do more. 

after blowing up, it made things awkward. people trickled out early too. now my grandma is talking about not doing christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. i feel bad, but i've never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. does anyone have any advice on this? handling rude family?  should i do something else? 


edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below

mom's reaction: on the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. she's always taken the high road it's a very korean christian mom approach. my mom's method of being a pacifist is very much an older immigrant/korean/boomer approach too. it's taught me a valuable skill in life. i don't regret picking my battles and that's why i'm so appreciative of being korean/white. after we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. she didn't say anything and asked me if i wanted my favorite korean dish. 

where is my dad: he was in the other room. yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. he's gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. we'd be fighting every year with someone new if we didn't pick our battles. we would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. my dad is the only one who isn't petty about dumb shit. defending my mom is everyone's responsibility not just my dad. including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. as soon as i got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (i can't describe it). there wasn't much for him to say or do because he didn't hear it. i was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. my white side has a ""keep grandma"" happy approach which is dumb. for years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn't. 

me: reflecting on this as a whole. i can't believe the response. it shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. after thanksgiving i started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. i have no relationship with this aunt. i should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who's 30 years younger. a small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. if she's not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), ""f*ck her"".  please don't use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. i should have tried to speak and i did what i felt was right, i don't regret it.. grandma's 80th bday is in two months.  i can't wait for that to be awkward. someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. cheers and have a happy new years!

update 12/29/18
i wrote a letter to my aunt explaining further how i felt and i didn't want this to affect how our family gatherings. i explained for years she's treated my mom like an outsider in how she talks to my mom. i told her if she speaks to my mom a littler nicer she will get nothing but respect from me. i told her i wished i had a better relationship to tell her this years ago. i told her i want nothing in return but her to be nicer to my mom. i'm leaving how we move forward in her hands.

i called my grandma to let her know i sent a letter to my aunt to try and fix things. i told her i didn't want this to ruin our family gatherings. my grandma apologized for not saying something earlier to my aunt. i was right for standing up for my mom. also.. this was amazing, my grandma told me ""i never wanted your mom to ever feel like an outsider in our family"" 
 
tldr: after 32 years i finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something i've been feeling for years. how do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. should i do something for blowing up?

"spamming suicide hotline numbers at depressed people or suicidal people doesn't seem that helpful.. you know the last thing i think most suicidal or depressed people want to hear is? you need to talk to someone. you should talk to a therapist. you should call this hotline. 

you think they haven't fucking thought of that? no shit. it's the first thing anyone says when someone is depressed; you should talk to a therapist.

honestly? i don't think there's a way to measure it, but if someone calls that hotline i don't think they were going to do it anyways (other than the ones that called it and did it on the call).

it's just annoying to me that when people say they're depressed and society sucks, and they joke about (or are serious about) killing themselves, no one ever offers real solutions but just says ""call this random number and talk to someone, oh i just know how you feel i've been there before""


edit: this seems split in terms of popularity. i'm gonna take this time to lay out what worked for me. feel free to tell me i'm an idiot, but i swear to god this worked for me. you know what pulled me out of my slump? realizing all of these other styles of help were bullshit, and that it was entirely my own mental state. if i was going to get out of it, i was going to have to be the one to make changes. at face value it sounds silly, but i really internalized this idea. i forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. it made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn't help i don't know what did. realizing society's shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, i was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. i took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. it wasn't easy, but i spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. this idea may be a crock of shit, but i gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them i thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. i actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all ""yeah, talk to someone!"" etc. was more helpful. if you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. they don't want to hear ""everything is okay"", they want to hear ""yeah you're right everything really is fucked."" if you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they'll appreciate it.

edit 2: i should have been more explicit when i wrote this. i'm sure hotlines help some people, i'm not saying they don't. i'm also not saying therapy doesn't help people.

edit 3: here's an analogy. your friend is in a hole (depression). you're standing outside of the hole. you're shouting phone numbers down into the hole and saying things like ""you're gonna be fine, it's okay"". in reality, it would be much more helpful if you could jump into the hole with them and show them the way out.

officially as of today jane has vacated my apartment, and building management has changed the locks. we were able to come to a signed agreement where she agreed to vacate the property within 7 days if i refunded her last two months of rent. (\~4200$). which i did. honestly between this and my other legal fees i am basically in the hole, and i would have been better off not having anyone rent my apartment. 

i talked to someone who is doing a story on jane, and they were able to confirm that she apparently works for a company rents out places on airbnb (said person who was doing a story basically told me they weren't going to pursue this anymore due to time concerns). she isn't a grad student nor is she even a student. 

i don't feel like i won, and honestly i just feel absolutely infuriated with the entire situation. airbnb to this day still has my place being listed on airbnb. who knows why she doesn't have keys anymore. 

my apartment is a disaster right now and from what my property manager has stated it seems like people definitely did smoke in my apartment. there are burns on my couch from cigarette, my dishwasher is broken, and pretty much everything needs a desperate deep clean. but my apartment is safe more or less. 

anyways i wanted to thank everyone for your advice. it probably isn't the best ending but it taught me an extremely valuable lesson, and i can go home at christmas and hopefully clean my apartment. ",2

tl;dr of last post: got a letter from a firm to prepare for a lawsuit for battery to someone i preformed the heimlich on. 


well, i took y'alls advice and went back to the restaurant, i spent about an hour and a half waiting and then speaking with a shift manager who called the general manager who called the owner, and they swore up and down that no one had come to ask for a tape or anything of the sort. 

then i started looking for defense attorneys but i wasn't sure exactly how to proceed, honestly this week i've been mortified and really on edge. finally when i told my friends about everything one of them fessed up to the fact that it was actually them and they made it up as some kind of prank. pretty twisted joke, i wasn't laughing. i'm pretty pissed and seriously reconsidering my relationship with him. i appreciate everyone's support, excluding the people who made fun of my mother's death or tried to figure out where i lived. 

tl;dr: friend made a fake letter from a law firm, soon he might be able to sue me for battery ",2
"by telling my three year old daughter that i would eat her booty. alright so let's start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you'll be like wtf? 

so my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  and more accurately it's more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife ""mommy, get my booty! get my booty mom"" and off to the races they go. 

obviously this is a game that both parents play and she'll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. this get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it's cute and we haven't gotten any feedback on it.

this brings us to last night. the wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells ""get my booty daddy!"" to which i reply nonchalantly ""i'm going to eat your booty! nom nom nom"" since her butt was right next to my face. 

i immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling ""eat my booty daddy! eat my booty"" and takes off running. dear lord, what have i done?! i try to go into damage control and revert back to get your booty, but it's too late, eat my booty is the new tag. 

i took her to daycare this morning, i hope she forgot all about it. i'm dreading picking her up.

tl;dr my daughter yells get my booty to initiate games of tag. with her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face i instead say i'm going to eat your booty! she now yells eat my booty to initiate the game instead. 

edit: a word. also thanks for the gold kind stranger!

there were lots of requests for an update after pickup. all is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. 

thanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. 

for those that got offended, sorry? none of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. cheers!",4
"i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. update here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d68r0f/update_im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and/)

&#x200b;

groom and i had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. i'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because i've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. in fact, since knowing him, i've talked him through each of his break ups. we've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, i helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. i'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. i've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

a month after his engagement, groomsman invitational boxes went out. we have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. of the original high school group, i was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. this obviously stung, but i maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. it triggered my depression for a solid month where i questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the groom and i had a talk.

he said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which i'm sure it was. he told me that i was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the bride would not sign off on my involvement. apparently, i had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. she'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). i'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. he said it was tearing him up inside, and i believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. he said that he'd let her know that i knew about how she felt towards me and that i'd be reaching out to talk about it. so i messaged the bride through text and dm, saying (paraphrased), ""hey! i'm so sorry if anything i've said has upset you. can we meet sometime and talk? i'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" the bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final groomsmen invitation box goes out to another friend.

fast forward to a few weeks ago, the bride, groom, and i are hanging out. groom and i are talking, and i'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so i ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. the conversation leads us here...

groom: hey man, i wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

me: sure. what's up?

groom: i was wondering if you would want to usher for me? it's no big deal if you can't, but i want you to be there for me if you can, you know? like, be a part of the wedding.""

me (very touched): yeah! of course i can, dude. anything for you two.

groom: thank you so much. you know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. i know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

me: i'll have to see if i can leave work early, but i'm already there, man. thanks for thinking of me!

a week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so i shoot him a text saying, ""hey man! big day's this weekend. just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. i got the time off with my boss, so i can definitely make it. just let me know."" he returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""yeah man, we would still like you to usher. i'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. thanks for helping us out!"" i'm a little put out, but i persevere. at least he asked me to be an usher. that's something, right?

morning of the wedding comes around and i'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time i should show up to the reception to start helping. then bride messages me asking for a favor. these messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages i had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. can i do this for a bride, on her wedding day? sure. oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **sure.**

at this point i should have stopped and asked myself, ""why am i helping so much? why didn't i ask for their money up front? should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" hindsight. 20/20. with the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while i go pick up the appetizers. thank god i played as much tetris as i have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. i text the bride to let her know we've got everything together and i'd see them at the reception. once again, left on read.

i get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. i find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. the venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. so i have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

since guests were already seating themselves, i immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. it was a fucking mess. at one point, i was so down about the situation that i literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" to start, the place cards were in no discernible order. they were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. i should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. we weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. the best part is, i say ""we"" because at this point i met my ushering-peers; they were the grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (i'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. when i asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. we did this at the wedding last year.""

after finding out that, to the groom, i was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. they ask me to stay for a drink, but i can't because i'm still ushering. as i step back behind the name card table, i take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. to my right, i see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. i look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and i wonder, how did i get here?

wedding kicks off & in the rare instance i can speak to bride & groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. i also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should i do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  i'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when i walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. i can understand this. maybe they're burned out. maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the groom approaches me.

groom: hey, thanks again for your help. i was wondering if i could borrow you again?

me: what's up?

groom: did you drive here? we have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

me: ... how far is the hotel?

groom: 10 minutes away.

me (for a groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... sure.

get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, i'm hungry. groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. he goes to get changed, i say i'm gonna grab food & come back. groom asks for food for he & bride. i say sure. bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. sure. then she asks the room at large who'd like food. now i'm buying food for almost the whole after party. cousin says she'll venmo me when i get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **sure.**

come back, cousin is passed out. drunken guests grab whatever food they see. groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. i grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. at this point, i'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that i never really had a best friend to begin with. i feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. i went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. this was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how i thought it would. i've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and i'm left wondering how i could have been such a chump, and how many other times i'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

the advice i'm hoping for is, how can i go about expressing how terrible a time i had at his wedding without insulting him, if i should do that at all, how can i develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? also, i feel like the missing puzzle piece is the bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what i did to her. i know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. how can i start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? should i just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200b;

tl;dr ""best friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

&#x200b;

update: wow. thank you for your overwhelming response to this. i want to thank everyone who took the time to share with me, be it positive or negative. i really feel like i need to hear it all before i make a next move, and i'm especially grateful for those of you who have extended friendship to me and those of you have been very critical of me. i'll take it all. i just want to become better than i am now. i'm legitimately reading through everything and, after work, i'll post a fleshed out update.",8

"update - dog ate neighbor's drone. *edit: original(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

a small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

i was served a summons by a sheriff's deputy, neighbor decided to take me to small claims over his drone. my mil is a paralegal secretary, so i was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. he seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. he also suggested i counter sue and how i could possibly add in more damages. 

he also told me that my neighbor and i technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under faa regulations. i called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). i don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. they took my information and have called me back once, so i know they're investigating but don't know anything else. not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

i brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos i had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. his main argument to the judge was that i ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which i (somehow) trained him to do"". which, yes i had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so i have somewhere to sit and eat outside. i argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. in the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). he is also banned from flying over my property, and i installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. he seems pretty upset with me, so i wanted to be careful. 

the only thing that could make this better is if the faa finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",2

update #2 following monday's notre dame game:

leading up to monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download snapchat, which i had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. i bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. he has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

anyway, so monday rolls around, i'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. i knew he'd have other friends there, all of which i'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. i get over there around 2. he has one friend already there and is expecting more. they trickle in and i'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. we cut up after the game, played some pool, james had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. i was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so i could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what i did. i did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. after some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

i asked james if we could talk outside. we walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""i know i kissed you the other day, and i don't know if that was something i should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. i've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and i think i may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" i was absolutely out there now. no turning back, i basically just told him i had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. he didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why i haven't brought it up before now. obviously i told him i had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the kiss! he reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. i could come to him with whatever was on my mind and i just teared up. it wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. i gave him a hug and told him i appreciated that, we sat down and i explained to him how confused i've been these last couple weeks. how this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. i sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. he is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things i said, they were all comforting. he told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. he is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. a few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.i don't know what i would call the gut feeling i had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out with him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  i felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. i have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. he explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but i shouldn't be pressured. i wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. i turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. full on made out for what seemed like ever. it was the most satisfying kiss i've ever had. this where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) i'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

by this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and i had to go. he walked me to my car and we made out a second time before i got in. he told me to get home safe and i did. i texted him to let him know i got home safe and hopped in the shower. i was so emotionally charged that i couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am. i ended up calling out of work tuesday. james and i have plans to hangout again this weekend. he wants to go out for food and a place called topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, i've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. i'm really looking forward to it and i'm just taking things day to day at this point. i know where we stand and i'm happy.

thank you for all of your support. i have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. i just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. you only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. i am learning this myself and i'm telling you, it's liberating.

i'll post any other updates here, above this one.  if anything big happens in the meantime i will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. i was very observant in our interactions, however, i didn't want to be so observant that i overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so i went with the flow and the vibes were great. we hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when i had the opportunity in conversation i mentioned that i had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and i told him that although i hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and i thought i might be curious to try it. i delivered this passively, just so not to put him on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. it felt like the time to make a move but i just didn't do it. we were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and i just didn't do it. it was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time i've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) we got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new nba 2k20 demo on ps4, i'll admit i'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but i kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. at the end of the night, around 11p i went to leave, i had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. i went in for our hug, when i pulled back i kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and i laid it on him, i went right in and kissed him. it was short, i didn't use much tongue, but i pulled back and said ""i guess i can say i've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, i guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, i had one on mine and it was fireworks in my stomach. i played it cool, i left and texted him when i got home that i was home safe and i thanked him again for a good time. he replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. he asked if i wanted to come over monday night for the notre dame game and a cook out, i told him i'd love to and i'll bring some ribs to cook.

we have texted as normal today and i can't tell you how excited i am for monday and to see what happens next. i know i waited awhile to update but i felt like i had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so i wanted to wait until i had more to report. i will post another update in the comment section here after monday.

thank you so much to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. i feel like i'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41.",8

"by escaping an escape room.. a friend-of-a-friend has apparently been into escape rooms for a while now, and finally decided to create his own as a halloween party experience for his friends.

since i don't know him, and wouldn't realistically be coming to the party, i agreed to take part in a test along with three other random folks that had been gathered for the dry run. it ended up being a group of four people who totally didn't know each other at all, as opposed to any sort of cohesive group of friends or employees.

our host told us a ton of rules and guidelines. don't break anything, no answers are hidden on or in something you have to ruin in order to see it, and so on. he was going to stand inside the room with us, but was to be ignored as if he wasn't there. this was in case we needed any direction or if we started doing something against the rules. he wore a black mask and black clothing.

immediately at the start of the game, everyone got quiet and started looking around slowly. as i mentioned, no one knew each other - and it was really awkward. i didn't want to be the ""guy who's super excited to lead the group"", and i guess they didn't either.

the escape room was history-themed. computer-printed photos of historical figures and explorers on the walls, a cheap dollar store style globe on an end table, and so on. lots of books stacked around.

the first thing i did was look at the combination lock on the door, which had four numbered rollers.

i put in the first relevant number i thought of, 1492, the date christopher columbus landed in the americas.

lock opens.

things got a thousand times more awkward.

i apologized and explained the situation to the host, who told me to sit down for the duration, re-locked  the door, and asked the remaining guests to figure out where the combination was hidden. the host was incredibly angry, but only in so much as i could hear it in his voice and see it in how he moved - mainly closing and re-locking the door hard. he didn't call me out for doing an obviously brain-dead thing and didn't say anything rude.

soonafter, i decided it'd be better if i just left, apologizing again.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - put the first thing that came to mind into a combination lock, ruined an escape room.

&#x200b;

**edit:** was told second-hand that he was (is?) mad i tried the lock right away instead of engaging with the puzzles at all. i can see how that can be considered a dick move, personally, but i appreciate everyone assuring me i didn't fu. i agree with you on principle i suppose, but i also can see how going directly for the lock was rude in a certain light. the escape room was ""intended to be easier than normal"" for the guests, the majority of whom haven't done one before. dunno if that's legit or an excuse, of course. thanks for all the positive responses!!",4
"update me / ca my teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.. well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. christ.

yesterday afternoon, after i made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), i called her gynecologist. (i have uterine issues so i got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

she was very understanding, and offered to stay late if i wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. so, i called the police, let them know i was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

my daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when i explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

the doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the sti tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. though i know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, i'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

after the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. he sat down with my daughter in our living room, while i hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear i'd hear it.)

the detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in maine i needed to speak to. i made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. he left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. he also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

after he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that i make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. i told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

this morning, i got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. his assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in ca, the custody arrangement is in ca, and it will be amended in ca (since ca is her state of residency), and in ca they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. he also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she had to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

i have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that i could help her as needed. right now she's mostly been playing world of warcraft and eating junk food, but i feel like at least right now i'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

i want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. i will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.",2

"by buying a used playstation 2 on letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.. this happened only minutes ago.


the graphics card in my old ps2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so i decided to replace it when i had a little extra cash. i was out browsing different sites like craigslist and the like, when i stumbled upon the ps2 mentioned in the title. it looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


at the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


now, i should preface this by saying that i have a strange faith in the honesty of others. benefit of the doubt and all that noise. after all, the car i drive now is one i bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. why should this be any different?


starting to sound like a mistake yet?


if the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. that is almost certainly about to change. the model the seller advertised on letgo was one of the larger black brick models. like, the first generation ones. when i finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. when he showed me the goods, it was actually one of the slim and silver ps2's from later in the console's production run. he told me he had already sold the larger one.


my first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that i should have walked away when i saw i was being sold something that was improperly advertised. unfortunately for me (and i guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), i was not in the most logical mood. it was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. i just wanted to get this thing and go home.


back at the ole ranch, i hooked up the console, slapped in kingdom hearts ii, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. i'm off work and done with class, what else would i do with my evening, right? i was pretty happy with my life until i realized i had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. strange, but not altogether discouraging. i slapped in another game that i new for sure was working. didn't read. i repeated this several times with discs i knew would work; same story.


now i'm starting to get slightly pissed. i'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


i open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. i've now got no way to contact him. of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. all i could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. that, or i could get onto youtube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. i picked the latter option and went on my merry way. after a video about a quick mod i could make to the system, i was feeling pretty confident that i was going to get the last laugh on this one.


oh golly gee fuck was i wrong.


now at this point, i begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. i manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. it's putting up a little more of a fight than i saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? it was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. with a little elbow grease, it starts to give. i'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. a bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so i can live with that. the further i get it open, the more rust i see on some more critical pieces. i'm sweating again, but holding out hope. finally, the plastic casing comes free, and i experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


i experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


you see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. the first thing i notice is that the inside is covered in rust. the second thing i notice is that some of the rust is moving.


oh, that's not all rust.


*ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


do you know that scene in raiders of the lost ark where indiana jones is like, ""snakes. why did it have to be snakes?"" that was me. except with cockroaches. they are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. and now they're crawling on my hands. and these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. i threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


they're getting everywhere now. i'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. you would think that something caught fire with the way i was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. tiny, $25 freaks of nature. eventually i managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point i grabbed a can of raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


at least, i *hope* i finished the job. i'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point i'm a little too emotionally drained to care. i also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that i *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and i already need a stiff drink.


tl;dr: i bought a used ps2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

edit: hi, reddit! i just wanted to say many thanks for the gold and all the offers for cockroach-free playstations!  warms my heart, and i'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. happy redditing!",4
"why do pregnancy test adverts never show a relieved young woman looking at a ""not pregnant"" result?. it's always the happy couple sat on the bathroom floor.",7
"for choosing my biological child over my foster son?. my husband and i never thought that we could get pregnant, so we got plenty of therapy after a few failed treatments and moved to fostering with the intent to adopt. we've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. he's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. 

the child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. we were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that i was pregnant. it was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and i am now over 40. i had thought i had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. 

unfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. we can't financially have both children. i can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who i am already bonding with. my husband wouldn't think of it either. we have to refuse the adoption. 

unfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. am i the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?

edit: 

baby:
baby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.

finances:

we currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. we are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. social services is giving us until january to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. we can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.

we don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. it's a catch 22 basically.",3
"by destroying the entirety of my family for only $99. throwaway account.

we've all been seeing the recent craze of dna testing and whatnot, so my dad and i decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. we got our results back a few days ago and i went into the dna relatives section to check out my matches. at the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% dna with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. this didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. my cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. we're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

i couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what i was seeing and i had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. the only realistic explanation for what i was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. all the dots lined up and i felt a sense of *loss*. i sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then i had a feeling of anger come over me. i needed some fucking answers. 

without even thinking, i rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. my mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. she had no idea my dad and i had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. my mother and i never had a 'traditional' relationship. she was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

my irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. i asked her if she cheated on dad with uncle david (name changed for obv reasons). i have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. she looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""what kind of question is this? of course not."" i told her everything; the test, percentages, dna matches, all of it!! shit hit the fan. my mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

i left her there and went back into my room. i called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. she ended the call screaming. dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. i told him everything too. he didn't say anything after calming down. he left the room and i locked the door. 

for the next few hours, i heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. my parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. my aunt in law and david showed up shortly later and i'm pretty sure i heard my dad and david get into some physical fight. utter chaos. 

i feel like fucking shit. ik it's not my fault but i can't help feeling that this is all because of me. if i had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. i'm too scared to go outside. i don't even know what the outcome was. the only noise i hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and i sure my dad is out of the house. fuck my life

tldr; mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. i take a dna test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. i've locked myself in my room and i'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

"for asking for pocket money because ""i am a kid too"". i am 19f, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. i am still studying so i cannot pay rent yet, but i do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


my father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. they have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. that plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. i had been arranged to join the kids' group, when i tried to protest they insist that i am a ""kid"" too, so i just had to submit to my fate. clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


so i spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. that includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to science park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. to be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when i sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(i admit, i am not really babysitter material). the kids seem to like me, so i guess it went well too. however, i still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


when my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. now, i don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes i can easily earn in a few hours, but i am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, i was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


i put on the biggest smile i and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. they were a little taken aback. i said as sweetly as i could that i deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. in all awkwardness i got my pocket money. needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.

i don't like the secrecy of her locking herself in her room and i'm worried she's trying to hide something from me or that she'll take the opportunity to lock me out. i admit that i've forgotten to knock sometimes but other than that i see no reason as to why she'd need a lock.

"for not letting my wife have mothers day after she ""canceled"" fathers day?. so, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.

&#x200b;

i've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. i love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. she is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  i will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). one of her big beliefs though is with holidays. she still celebrates holidays with the family (christmas, easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""money"" side of things. we're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

last year in june my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. i was a little hesitant but i agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. all of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. i obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. all of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. she's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. we fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

so, wife and i have been together 17 years.  we are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  about two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  so off we got to the gp, who gives us a consult to a rheumatologist.  come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  fast forward to a month ago, when our north texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  she woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were huge, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  and even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  so, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  so, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from ireland and custom designed, and have words in gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  she was absolutely gutted.  i assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but i could tell, to her, it was.

begin sherlock holmes mode.  i googled until i couldn't google anymore.  i was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  i searched some more.  i finally found his personal facebook page, and i message him, and wait......and wait......

i finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  i express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  i go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  she tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

fast forward a couple of weeks.  i get a message on facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  she explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and molds in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  she sent pictures, and i confirmed that yes - those are our rings!  she said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

i open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  of our rings.  she went ahead and had her brother, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  i asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and i was allowed to keep my old one.  she told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  i asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

our ""new"" wedding bands will be here thursday.

trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has no idea any of this took place.

\*edit - i rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her i was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  the absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to not tell her as we tell each other everything.  so now i not only need to figure out how to do this, but not to spill the beans until then.  (our friends nicknamed us mickey and mallory as well as marshall and lilly from ""how i met your mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*edit 2 - i thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where i actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (va nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so always goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when i originally proposed, i waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*edit 3 - and to those of you saying ""i"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  she is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  she is the reason i breathe, and supported all of us when i went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  she is my hero.  i wake up every day to earn her all over again.  this was one small thing i was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why i have a heartbeat.  and i don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if i seem sappy.  if a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

tl;dr wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, i went hardy boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

"my (28f) boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) are going on a week-long vacation. they uninvited me.. my boyfriend wanted to go on a vacation this summer to his mom's friends' house in hawaii with me and his two best friends (25m and 29f). we had been planning on this all spring, and at some point, 25m dropped out of the trip, leaving just the three of us.

for context, my boyfriend and i have been going out since november, and it's been serious. we had (and still have) been talking about moving in together and he has said, and i agree, that this is a long-term situation and that we are in it for good.

in early june, once 25m unexpectedly dropped out of the trip, 29f called my boyfriend and told him that now that it was just the three of us, she didn't feel comfortable with me going on the trip, since she didn't know me that well and she didn't want to be a third wheel. she said that if i were to go, she wouldn't go on the trip. without telling me that this was happening, they changed the plans and made it a trip just the two of them and they changed the location to a beach in costa rica.

i was trying to figure out when to ask for time off this summer and hadn't heard news about the plans, so i asked my boyfriend which week in august i should be setting aside for the hawaii trip. he let me know that, actually, he had talked to his friend and that she didn't want to go if i were going, so he was going to go alone with her to costa rica. he said that we could go another week later maybe to mexico city or something.

i was upset, and tried to talk with him about how the situation made me feel, especially since this wasn't a case of a separate trip being set up ahead of time -- this was a case of me being invited and then uninvited from a week-long tropical vacation with a girl friend of his who i had never met before. we eventually decided to do a trip together to copenhagen, which we have both wanted to visit, as some sort of compensation. i also asked to meet her, so that i could feel more comfortable with the trip.

we spent the 4th of july going to see her and her boyfriend in the city where they live, and although it was nice to put a face to a name, it was ultimately a very cold trip and she was not at all welcoming to me. my boyfriend remarked on how unfriendly she was -- to both of us, he thought -- and said that he was surprised that she didn't act warmly to me. i went out of my way to try get to know her and her boyfriend (i'm very outgoing and friendly and usually this would be easy), but it didn't really click, even after several days. they were somewhat cold to each other as well -- they bickered a little bit about their future and his own 3 week trip without her that was scheduled for the same time as their trip (this had been scheduled before ours had).

this had been my effort to feel better about the trip, so i told my boyfriend that i still didn't feel comfortable with things, and that i was feeling insulted by the way that it was handled. i had tried to make things smooth between all of us, and i asked him to please come up with something that could help me feel better about the trip.

on a visit to his family, they asked about the trip and they were all shocked that he would have arranged it this way, and let me know that they would have been furious if they were in my position, which triggered a fight in which i asked him to please help come up with a strategy to make me feel better and more secure about them going together without me. he said that he would never do this kind of thing again, which feels like not much to offer, since this is kind of a once in a lifetime trip to begin with. he kind of offered to not go on the trip, but he had already paid for the tickets and made arrangements and i didn't want to stop their trip and be resented by both him and his best friend.

he asked me to give him ideas of how to make me feel better and wanted me to just tell him what to do and stalled and stalled until it was finally the day of the trip. he bought me a bag of peanut butter cups and i drove the two of them to the airport.

i feel so disregarded and disrespected in this situation. i want to break up with him, but i don't want to burn up something that has otherwise been really good.

tl;dr - i (28f) was uninvited from a vacation with my boyfriend (29m) and his best friend (29f) and i can't get over it. i want advice on how to talk with him about this.

"my parents are kind of stupid and don't believe in vaccines. now that i'm 18, where do i go to get vaccinated? can i get vaccinated at my age?. as the title explains, my parents think vaccines are some kind of government scheme. it's stupid and i've had countless arguments over the topic. but, because of their beliefs i've never been vaccinated for anything, god knows how i'm still alive. but, i'm a senior in high school now with a car, a license, and money of my own. i'd assume that i can get them on my own but i've just never had a conversation with anyone about the subject. i'm also afraid i'd go somewhere that up charges vaccines way more than somewhere just down the street. any advice would be awesome 

also, i know rule 5 says no medical advice, but this seems less than ""how do i treat \_\_\_\_ disease"" and more of ""everyone does this and i don't what should i do?"" i'm going to get vaccinated but it's more of a matter of where do i go to get vaccines.

"we shouldn't put such a high price on life. if someone wants to die, let them. life is long, tedious, and for a lot of people painful. and if some people just don't want to go through the process, i don't see why we should stop them. some people just don't want to do it anymore, and with how meaningless life is in the end, i don't think it should be so valued

"by accidentally buying tickets to the red hot chili pipers not peppers. few years back i was a bit drunk and saw online that the ""red hot chili pipers"" were playing in edinburgh...i thought it was the red hot chili peppers! £30 for a ticket i thought it was a bargain! bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time).

i am a huge fan of the red hot chili peppers and i was super stoked to finally see them in edinburgh! most bands play in glasgow so i couldnt believe my luck when i saw they were playing in my city!

so we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then i heard some bagpipe music was playing.

i thought hmm interesting...not what i expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in scotland and the capital city i really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

about an hour in i was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but i was waiting for the red hot chili peppers to come out so i could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

i turned to the man next to me and asked when the red hot chili peppers were coming on he laughed and said ""aye pal good joke eh""

it was at this moment i realised i was not going to see the red hot chili peppers.

tl;dr: bought tickets to the red hot chili pipers thinking it was the red hot chili peppers.

"my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile. hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

i don't really know how to begin so i'm just gonna dive right in. we've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and i have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. this took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. his parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. to the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

the problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. he has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. he talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. cool, i thought. that all sounds beautiful. 

we didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. it was on a day i was working so i couldn't go with him and when i asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. i was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

i did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

it was definitely a shock but i reacted positively and told him it looked really good. it was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

it's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. i can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. bf is super proud of it and i honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

my only issue with it is during sex. 

it takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. it doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo really stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

not to mention this thing is like the mona fu*cken lisa. 

any position that we're facing each other in, i always end up making eye contact with it. and every time i do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. every time. ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, i doubt i would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of any six year old. 

it's honestly ruining our sex life. 

i haven't told my bf any of this because i feel like i can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (i know lasers exist but i doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where i'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried i'm not attracted to him anymore.

i am attracted to him. i'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

what can i do in this situation? the thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. but looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

should i talk to him? am i overreacting? is our sex life officially dead? 

thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- my boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and i can't stop making eye contact with it during sex. 


———————————————————

update: this has gotten a lot more attention than i anticipated. some people are saying it's reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. i'm not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. currently debating whether i should just let fate take the wheel on this one. 

otherwise i've received some really phenomenal advice on how i should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward. i was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship-ending issue before i made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through. so thank you so much. 

i'll make a new post to update how things go once i've talked to my bf about all this. if he doesn't see this post first i think i'll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

"the reason a lot of subreddits are moderated terribly is because normal, mentally healthy people don't have the time to moderate internet forums for free.. all these ""power mods"" that moderate multiple big communities do so because they don't have a life. removing posts and comments they don't agree with is all they have going for them. i just feel bad that nobody loves them so they have to come here and gain some fake sense of authority by silencing people that don't live in their mother's basement.edit: got a message saying i had to add more to the post, so here it is:

i was discussing this with a power mod who says that if you don't like the sub, you should just stop using it because it ultimately belongs to the creators or moderators. i understand that point of view for creative subreddits such as r/nottheonion, r/tifu, r/eli5 and the like, but subreddits that people got a control over just because they were at the right place at the right time, subreddits that someone else would definitely have created anyway, those communities belong to the users and not the moderators. subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/soccer, r/pics belong more to the community than the people that created it. 

there aren't even a lot of communities with over a million subscribers, if the admins wanted to clean out the moderators and bring in new people it wouldn't take much work at all. the admins should feel some sense of responsibility when r/news removes important news stories just because it doesn't promote their agenda.

"i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately.. i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

this is a throwaway account, due to certain circumstances i worry for my safety of myself, family, & friends so thus the throwaway. 

i am currently residing in wisconsin.

i believe my babysitters boyfriend touched my 2 year old son inappropriately. 

**information:**
my very first inkling something was up, is the day i believe this happened he came running crying into my arms when i picked him up, previously he was excited to be dropped off and picked up because he loved being there. and they had both previously baby sat my child and other children for a year, and there were absolutely no issues at all.

after this had happened, my 2 year olds entire demeanor has changed negatively, he has become angry and aggressive toward everyone in the house, including the family animals.

that night i had picked him up, i changed his diaper before bed and his body had  become stiff as a board. this is extremely unusual as my 2 year old usually is a playful child and tries to squiggle away from me or ""washes his hands"" with the baby wipes. this time he was not himself. he was scared, eyes wide as a deer in the headlights. as i took off his diaper he covered his eyes and began weeping softly, then moving his hands to cover hisgenitals and shouts, ""no! no no friends boyfriends name!"" and began crying hysterically. 

my heart sank. as a mother, my gut feeling is screaming that something happened to my baby. i know something was done to my baby. 

i looked my friends boyfriend's criminal records online and he has many petty things starting from 1999 but most notably he was charged with 3rd degree rape of a minor under 12. this man is dangerous, and i didn't even know this.

**my concerns and what can i do?:**

notably in wisconsin, cases involving you children, how often does cps investigate the person reporting? both myself and the party involve?

will the investigators / cps take this matter seriously when regarding my child's age?

how do i go about reporting this and keep me and my family safe?

what kind of things will they (either cps or law enforcement etc) look into?

if reported, and nothing happens, what things can i do to protect my child(ren) and my family? 

for a two year old child who has been sexually molested, what are some other signs i can keep my eyes open for?

any advice, any help at all will greatly help. i'm absolutely devastated and need help as i'm at a loss.

**edit:** i need to mention that this man has gang ties that originate from a very large city near us, hence why i'm scared for myself and my family.

**edit 2**: i am currently on my way to my appointment with cps and law enforcement that specializes in sexual abuse cases i will update later, thank you all so much for your kind words of support and advice, i honestly appreciate it and will update on the outcome.",2
"us, ok disgruntled neighbor has installed a strobe light to stop epileptic kids from using a school bus stop.. to give some context on where we live: we're in a small neighborhood of about 5 homes; it's a very small cul-de-sac area in the middle of farmland. there aren't other homes or buildings for about 2 miles.

i have 3, young, elementary aged children that all have a very serious case of epilepsy: it does not take much to cause an episode. by some luck, two of our neighbor's kids also have epilepsy, and are also around the same age as our kids. for the past few years they have been able to successfully group together and go to the end of our community to catch the bus.

the family who used to own the house at the street recently moved out, and there is a new owner who has been an absolute hell to everyone. from the second day on, he has harassed our kids telling them to get off his property, even though they were technically on a public road. through the grapevine he somehow learned that a majority of the kids were epileptic, and has installed strobe lights in his front lawn. these are very powerful, very fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

we've contacted the police, and they won't even come out to talk to the guy. we've contacted the school to see if they could come into the neighborhood to pick up our kids, and they really can't: the bus just couldn't drive into our neighborhood and easily back out. they have to be picked up on the street.

what can we do?

&#x200b;

**edit:** just to clarify, we have confronted the neighbor and yes he intentionally did it knowing the kids were epilitic. he hates kids, and has made it very apparent even calling the lights ""brat repellent"".",2

 i went to a legal shop here in montreal and left slmost immediately due to the overwhelming douche baggery happening in there. they turned bob marley, a man who sang songs of love and unity, and turned him into a mass marketed caricature who seemed to have only cared about weed. every mention of 420 makes me roll my eyes, if anything, canadians should celebrate 10/17 (the day cannabis was legalized federally). and dealers in general are insufferable weed snobs.

 every dealer i have had until my current suppliers have been arrogant douchebags who try and tell you you are ""smoking wrong"" and think they are your friends. i know it's shitty to bag on how people enjoy things but weed culture makes all cannabis users looks immature, lazy and stupid.

"updateoregon neighbor cut down trees on my property. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/


hello legal advice community! i have not forgotten about you, who helped set me on the path to justice! i'll get right to it. i can't speak to all the details, and i'm sorry about not continuing to update (after everything got underway i figured it would be best not to). to keep it short, we (my lawyer and i) spoke to the police, who then spoke to the neighbors down and across the street (the one who witnessed my trees getting cut down) who stated they saw the neighbor and the company cutting down the trees, and then finally they spoke to him (neighbor). i don't know much beyond that with the criminal investigation, what happened with the whole city document or the company, and why that is will be explained below.


i hauled his ass into court. well, first, the arborist came, as did the surveyor. the trees were on my property and they were white oaks. the arborist gave me an estimate on having 15 mature white oaks brought and replanted on my property, which was just shy of $650,000, though he did say some trees would die and that would drive the cost up. i also had my property appraised, for the difference before and after losing my trees. it then became a question of whether i wanted to pursue my lost trees and see how much their lumber was worth, or sue for the replacement cost and loss of property value. basically, do i want the trees back or do i want the cost of the ones i lost? (apparently you can't have both).

well guys...

i picked the trees.

the actual court stuff started a lot sooner than i thought. we filed, a few weeks passed, and a few days before our day in court his lawyer reached out with a settlement offer. apparently he was wealthier than i thought. we accepted and while i can't speak to the details of it...

i'm getting the trees back!

it's going to take a long time apparently (several months, possibly all the way until september since the process didn't start until just this week due to the holidays), but i will have all 12 trees back on my property at no cost to me! my neighbor has also put his house up for sale, and i haven't seen him for quite some time now. oh well! there's a bit more to the settlement, but i don't feel comfortable speaking to that, hopefully that's understandable.

i remember some of the comments about whether the trees were a hazard to the road based on how far they were from the road. i ended up having to check with the county (not the city), and they sent someone out to measure and mark the boundaries. my trees were at least 5 feet beyond it (so outside the boundary). not even close! just thought i'd add that in.


anyways, there it is! i plan to take photos of the trees once they start getting put in, and of course once they are all in place and i have them back. i'll be sure to share them! i want to thank everyone for all their advice, it was a huge help! i didn't know you all were so into trees, but i'm glad you are!

have a good one everyone!",2

"update: me (36m) found out that my wife (34f) was cheating on me with multiple men. in my original post i was still unsure what to do as seen here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me\_36m\_found\_out\_my\_wife\_34f\_has\_been\_cheating\_on/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dlxqbv/me_36m_found_out_my_wife_34f_has_been_cheating_on/) 

but after getting lots of great comments from you guys as well as talking with my closest friends, i got enough encouragement to gain some faith in my self. i finally opened my eyes to what i had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that i would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so i decided last thursday to tell her i wanted to end this marriage.

i think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. she didn't even try to persuade me or anything. just went like a broken record ""nothing i say will change anything"" whenever i asked her to say anything. there was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. we have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.

my mother knows everything, but i for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. maybe i'm afraid of a ""war"" between my soon to be ex wife and me so i agreed to give her time to tell them. when we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. instead we told them that there was some ""unsolvable disagreements"", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. they have been part of my family for almost 17 years and i care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. i felt really bad about lying to them, but i'm afraid that if i go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. but my patience is not limitless. i will tell them eventually if my ""wife"" doesn't come clean soon.

i don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. i'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to ""growing apart, wanting different things etc."". i also don't want to be known as the ""poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy"".

now there are some big loose ends to tie. we need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. the custody will be shared where i will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. i also feel like their legal address should be with me, so i won't have to pay her child support. would be unfair after what she did. i have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. i will fight for my kids though.",8

"update 2: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving. i am making this as i feel i owe it to all of you. the amount of pm's and responses have been incredible. many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. both the negative and positive comments have helped me and i would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

yesterday i was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. the only person i responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. i didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

during the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as i need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). my plans have changed a bit, i am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend i was supposed to go to. i called him up and let him know i want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but i know i will be leaving for somewhere. he said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. we will see how that turns out...

later in the day i responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since i sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
i picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. i could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. she kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. she i have misunderstood the entire situation... i could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). anyway i told her to explain it to me right then and there. she said because i only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that i should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. during the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
after she told me its all a misunderstanding i told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
after i hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). it didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. she said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. i was just quiet during most of it. the more i didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

she started telling me i can fuck other women if i want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
i told her fucking other woman was not something i needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
the sister was telling her stuff in the background but i couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

she kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. after that she started saying something but i just hung up. 

for like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. he told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that i always will be welcome to him and that i am a good guy. his wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. she tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. i politely tell her i appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

my ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. she then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
she kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and i didnt say much.

after some time i just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. she starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that i said i would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. i told the sister i only said i think about it, and now that i have i realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. she then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
the only thing i said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". after this i just hung up.

my phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. i dont plan on responding. i honestly feel alot better right now, like i can move on. i will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. if someting more happens i will update this post.

maybe i will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

i dont know when i feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, i am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

thanks!

edit 1: thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold i appreciate the support alot. i however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

i would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. i am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

also i dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity i dont mind answering them.

i also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). in a month? when i am back from vacation?

once again thanks for all the support

"by jerking off and forgetting my petcam was faced directly at me. so i want to just say this is 100% true and 100% embarrassing. 


so i usually have monday's off and spend the day doing homework, tidying up, playing video games, and today... jerking off. i don't usually feel inclined to do this however today i had the urge. it was about an hour before my girlfriend got home so i definitely had time. i go into my room and get into bed and start skimming thru ol' faithful aka pornhub. 

i finally find a video worth b'ing my l to and get down to business. as i'm about to... ya know... i get an alert on my phone that my girlfriend had just accessed the petcam we have in our room that's on our dresser. (we got this petcube camera for christmas so we can watch our two dogs while we are at work/school/out.) i immediately stop, now knowing that my girlfriend just witnessed me jerking it mid-monday so i text her ""........"" . she doesn't answer for about 2 minutes and then i see that she's calling me. 

now we've been together 2.5 years so this isn't like a make or break thing and i honestly thought that although it was slightly embarrassing, it was also pretty funny. so i answer the phone laughing, ready for this to be something we joke about for a long time to come. unfortunately, i was sadly mistaken to this being ""funny"". she tells me that her co-workers had asked about our dogs and she wanted to show them on our awesome petcam! but instead of two cute dogs on our bed, it was just me with my shorts down at my ankles, going to town on myself! so needless to say i don't think i'll be invited to any of her work christmas parties in the future.

tl;dr : decided to crank it before my girlfriend got home and forgot my petcam was faced directly at me. she wanted to show her co-workers our dogs and instead showed them me jerking it in our bed.

edit: lmao just some clarification... she's shown coworkers before because they love our dogs and ask to see them because it's ""cute"" to see them live and sleeping. also, in her defense, i told her i was doing homework and what not so the last thing to cross her mind was me yankin it probably. also the cam is tucked in the corner so i forget it's even there most the time. (b'ing my l = blowing my load)

edit 2 (last one) : for everyone saying ""why would you have a petcam facing your bed?"" that's where our dogs are 90% of the time. when we are out of the house, that's where we leave them. when we are home, that's mostly where they want to be unless we're on the couch with them. don't you think we put the camera there..... for a reason? lol and btw, my gf and i are fine! she was freaked out about it at first but now it's already funny. that's why i love her so much lol so take it easy on her, we both fucked up!

not that i need to prove anything but this is for people asking to see them. (it's a great dane and am-staff btw)

"for forbidding my wife to go to her affair partner's funeral?. married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  in our second year of marriage my wife went home when i was deployed and slept with some dickhead (who i'll refer to as sd from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  she hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  sd and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.

&#x200b;

the reason i didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after i got home.  and she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  no she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though i agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.

&#x200b;

she immediately cut off all contact with sd and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that i was right to keep her.

&#x200b;

well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from sd's mother that sd died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.

&#x200b;

my wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like i got kicked right in the dick.  i instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. all those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  the pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.

&#x200b;

i asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  she keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".

&#x200b;

i can't stop repeating that i'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and i'm re-living all those shitty nights i was sure our family would be shattered and i would only see my daughter 50% of the time.

&#x200b;

after some back and forth i put my fucking foot down and told her no, she cannot go.  i said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  aita?

&#x200b;

edit: seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying ""feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that i was right to keep her."" as if i'm saying i own her and she's a piece of property to me.  that is not the case, i am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.

edit 2: i apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as sd, because that's what he was.  fuck 'im.

a lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean i have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point i can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  we're going to counseling starting tomorrow",3

"guy tried to pass me and hit oncoming traffic. said he'd sue me since i didn't slow down (ga). edit: finally know everything that has occurred legally. my stepdad has some friends and found out what was reported. after the officer told me i could leave, the drivers of both cars were taken to the hospital and the officer eventually met up with the guy overtaking me once he was stable. guy told him i sped up and that i was ""mad he was passing me."" said officer went back and looked up my license number (whoever said they normally get numbers for everyone was right. i didn't even think he actually got it) and saw that i already had a speeding citation (from a year ago) and considered it reasonable enough to give me the leaving scene of an accident citation. so. the officer stated his reasoning was the discovery of new evidence i.e. my old ticket. 

my parents are furious and we're just waiting for my day in court because there's no evidence i sped up, there's no dash cam footage that's mysteriously came up, there's nothing besides the guy making an illegal pass saying it was my fault. 



hello! 17 year old here with okay driving history (i have a speeding ticket but i did my time for it). i was on the way to school a few weeks ago and was driving pretty much at the speed limit because it's been rainy for a few weeks and i'm also just still paranoid since my first ticket. two lane road, solid yellow lines. 

cue a-hole tailing me and eventually crossing over to pass. i guess he didn't look good enough because he ended up going headfirst into a car in the opposite lane. i swerved out into the grass and my car was fine but the other two were pretty messed up. the first police on scene did ticket him for crossing the solid yellow but the driver was pretty much unconscious anyway. 

i moved on from it since i didn't cause the accident and i went on to school. yesterday, my stepdad got some papers (my car is registered in his name) from the juvenile court for my county saying i was being faulted for an accident and that this guy's insurance was coming after me. i was so confused because my car wasn't damaged, i don't need this on my driving record, and so on. my stepdad went through the papers and it seems like the original driver is trying to say it was my fault he hit someone because i was supposed to slow down when i saw him passing. 

i have absolutely no idea what to do here. is this a situation where i can tell him to pound sand or should i take it seriously? 

edit: my stepdad called juvie court today and asked what i was charged with and he was told that the officer on scene i spoke to (i told him exactly what happened - guy passed me and hit someone. he asked to see my license. i didn't see why not. he basically said ""thanks for reporting i'll contact you if i need anything else have a good day"") is citing me for leaving the scene of an accident. and the reason he let me go then was because he ""didn't know i could've prevented the accident until further investigation.""

we're even more confused and my parents went to the insurance people today and they said no one has contacted them but they made copies of all the paperwork and that we'd all just have to wait. i'm guessing other driver got my license plate number and told him i sped up or something. i don't know what to do here because if this sticks, i lose my license until i turn 21 (stipulation of my first ticket).

"(update) brother (15m) made fake instagram of me (25m) to make jw parents think i'm not gay.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cjkflc/my\_brother\_15m\_has\_been\_lying\_about\_my\_25m\_life/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjkflc/my_brother_15m_has_been_lying_about_my_25m_life/) 

thank you all for your illuminating comments. i'm honestly overwhelmed at the response & apologize for not replying much, it was so much. but i'd like to specifically thank u/\_\_my\_man\_\_(https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) for his comment, which suggested that this was not him trying to rope me back in, but him trying to escape the cult. you were exactly right.

today we talked for the first time since our conversation. he took down the insta after our conversation (which i hadn't noticed at the time of writing the post, haha), and i gently asked why, exactly, he did this. he's fifteen, so he didn't quite have the language to say ""i'm being abused and need to leave the jw."" what he said, instead, was that mom and dad are ""crazy"" and he's become disillusioned with the cult (he even used the word ""cult""). he still believes in god and wants to explore different sects of judeo-christianity. my hometown is a small place in the midwest, and everyone knows who the jw are...they're, like, ""those people"". so he couldn't covertly go to another service without someone recognizing him and it getting back to my parents.

his motive was pretty much what u/\_\_my\_man\_\_(https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) said. he said he wants to visit, hang out, and explore the religions around chicago, but the only way my parents would allow him to leave town is if they knew exactly where he was, who he was with the whole time, etc. so in his head, propping me up as converted was the only way to make it happen. i told him i was completely uncomfortable with that, and that my relationship with my parents is over. he apologized, and pretty much already knew the logistical problems. i think this was a very maturing ordeal for him.

i established myself as a lifeline. i told him that if it ever gets too much, i will pay for his train ticket and he can stay with me for as long as he likes, even moving in for the remainder of high school. (and i mean it: i have enough space, and my aunt will help with childcare/extra expenses). he seemed apprehensive, but the thought's out there, and he now seems comfortable enough to vent about the church/my parents/my crazy ass sister directly. 

as for my parents, i just told him to cold turkey stop talking about me. if they ask (and this was suggested by julie, my ""bride-to-be""), he will tell them that i might have refound christianity but i have no intentions to return to the watch tower, and that he stopped talking to me. leaving jw for any reason is grounds for excommunication. and i put my actual insta on private, in case they go looking. they might think i'm not gay, might now have the sliver of hope that i'll return to them, but that's honestly not my fucking problem. 

and for the guys who suggested this was a honeypot...no. no fifteen year old can act this well. he's so, so full of love and kindness, and as fucked up as his plan was, it was at the end of the day because he is panicking in a toxic enviorment. 

thank you all, again. my brother is back in my life, and i now have the means to help him. thank you, thank you, thank you.

"i got attacked by a dog and the owner did nothing. florida i owe $120,000 in medical debt due to the emergency plastic surgery i needed on my face.. i (25f) was attacked in a dog park by a pitbull, the dog park is an enclosed area where owners are supposed to watch their dogs off leash.  it happened february 3rd, 2018. the attack was classified as a level one trauma. i arrived to the dog park before noon with my two dogs. the dog was being aggressive towards my dog, a puppy. before this they were dry humping each other. i went to lift my dog to prevent a situation but the pit bull turned on me. the last thing i remember is it *****. i remember me being on the ground covered in dirt and mauled for like three entire minutes. he locked on two of my limbs. ripped my face apart, and left my dog for dead.i tried so hard to defend him and myself but this dog overpowered the both of us. i was rushed to the emergency room,  given an immediate mike of fentanyl for the road but even that couldn't calm the pain. which is really the only thing i can remember for the aftermath part. i almost went into cardiac arrest from rate my heart was pumping is what a nurse told me. i wasn't aware of the extent of my injuries but i couldn't see from my left eye.  a few days later i woke up and found out.  several of my nerves have been severed from this attack. since it was an emergency procedure, the medical cost is exponential. right now i'm working every hour i can, i'm in counselling, i find it hard to be anywhere in public where dogs can be alone. i cannot go into the sun because my face scars darken so easily. and my self confidence has been ruined.  is there any way the dog owner (i know who she is) can be responsible for the medical fees i'm faced with?",2
"my gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where i proposed.. i decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. i flew her to vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in cambodia. she had wanted to see angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. after a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together i proposed and she said yes. we kissed and i had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. it's really beautiful. she took a shower and i laid in bed thinking what an amazing day i just had and how i would get to spend the rest of my life with the women i loved. when she came out of the shower however she was in tears. she handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

i played it cool and said i understood but truthfully it hurt. it seems to me that i had offered her something of value. a lifelong commitment and partner. i took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. i felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. it was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. if she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. so she can't possibly value me or what i have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place i asked. 

i'm preparing to end things when we get back. she wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but i'm done. am i wrong? should i do it over? what do you think.

any advice is appreciated.",8
"by pitching a really fucking stupid slogan to my only cool client. i'm in marketing, particularly in the business of slogans. so, a few days ago i was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and they told me they had a problem: they had an uncharacteristically shitty location.

there's no way people were just finding this place on their own. it was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. so, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.

last night, i went there to get some food... for research, ya know... anyway, i was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. the pizza was really good. the beer selection was varied. they had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. pretty good stuff. even if i wasn't writing for them, i would've given them 5 stars on yelp, is what i mean.

when i was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.

i wrote a lot of garbage for a while (""where wine country is next door!""), but i was determined to get something usable. 

finally, it hit me: ""go somewhere."" it had nearly everything i wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.

but, still, it wasn't quite there. it lacked the feel i wanted, felt a little too abstract. customers didn't need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. they needed to be pointed.

after another hour or so, i had it.

eventually, the slogan i pitched these poor people was this:

""go somewhere else""

which, i believe the corporate equivalent of is like ""get the fuck out of my face.""

they haven't emailed me back.

tl;dr: today i fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan i wrote and i'm pretty sure i definitely lost a client because of it.",4

"update: for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?. this is the original post: /r/amitheasshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

i first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. it honestly helped me so much and without it i don't know if i'd end up in this position.

so i went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. they of course said no. i'm kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he'd come to me if it meant so much. however he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn't work he'd definitely accompany me to the principals office.

so i went to my teacher. i already knew how everything was going to go out so i didn't have any hope. i told her that i don't appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues i would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the mrs.). she told me that i was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. i told her that many people don't think she's fair and in return she just looked confused. i handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she's my english teacher). her face went from nothing to just sadness. i swear it was so weird. it's like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

she apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. and saying my name just gets her bad memories i guess? she told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. at this point i kinda felt guilty because i never took this thought into consideration.

she told me she'd try to say my name ( and won't cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime i can still call her by her first name. ( all my classmates are jealous because i'm the only person allowed lol)

we've talked about the past detentions she's given me and she said she'll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

honestly this isn't how i thought things were going to turn out. and i'm pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",3

"young men opting out of society to play video games and focus on their hobbies are ... acting completely reasonable.. there are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women, don't work as many hours as they used to, and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something. this naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death, having an insanely expensive wedding, and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out.

if you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. it's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, i think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. there just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and i can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. young men don't owe society anything. we should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

so as long as a woman is able to keep up a lie for several years, she should be able to trap any man to be a dad to her kids?

"for dumping my gf after her unannounced backpacking trip. ok so this happened maybe three days ago, but first some context.

me and my (now ex) girlfriend of 3 years lived in a 2 bedroom apartment which i pay for by myself, as i make enough money to afford it and i didn't want to trouble her by pressing her with a bill for a place that is a tiny bit out of her price range, instead we use a meter and pay the bill through my account, with her compensating her  spend.
 
we also have always been big on trust since both of us have been cheated on in previous relationships, and didn't want to go through that again in this one.

the fact that i pay solely this apartment is important as it allows her to spend her money on things like more expensive gifts and the occasional excursion for us (which of course i pay in part for). also the fact that we are big on trust means we tell eachother a lot about our lives and future plans.

anyways, she was always a fan of these trips abroad and loved travelling, and for the most part our trips were always fun. however, about three days ago she announced that she had bought tickets for a solo backpacking trip across south america which she was going to go on on friday, and that she had been planning this for months.

first i asked if i could come, to which she said no because she would be ""discovering herself"" on this trip, and when i asked why hadn't she told me she said because i wouldn't have allowed (or at the very least not wanted) her to go, especially alone.  (which is mostly true)

well an argument ensued and at some point i finally put my foot down, it went something like this: 

gf: ""why can't i just go explore the world and live life to its fullest""

me: ""you can, without me or the security of my home, pack your bags and get out""

i believe it was the right thing to do as she didn't pay for the apartment anyways, and so didn't have any right to demand to stay, plus i was willing to give her money for a hotel for a week, which she refused.

that night she went to her parents home an hour away and my phone was blown up with people calling me a controlling asshole and the like, my question is am i really an asshole for this?

tldr: girlfriend popped a surprise solo trip on me 5 days before she left, saying she wanted to go alone and had been planning it for months, i kicked her out my house.

"by not taking off my apple watch or disabling the 911 feature and accidentally called police while i was handcuffed and being spanked by my husband and the police heard me screaming.. to begin, i'm a female bdsm practitioner. i enjoy it, and i won't apologize. (edit: that came out harsh. i'm sorry)

my husband often cuffs and whips me, and on wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. he put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my apple watch. i didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

so we get into it, and he's spanking me and i'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly i hear from my watch ""ma'am, i hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. we are sending someone to you. hold tight."" 

""did you call 911???"" my husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

so i tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name she said my name here? and i say yes... and she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

i said okay thank you, and i hung up.

""the police are coming.""

shit. i'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. we put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

i calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. i didn't mention the spanking.

apparently my husband did. another police officer comes in and asks about our bdsm contract. ""he told you about our contract?""

""he felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show state of mind.""

i go get our contract and showed it to the officers. after a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the apple watch if we're going to do that again.

"for telling my son that if he changes his last name then i'm no longer his father?. let me start off by saying my son, adam, is 22 years old. back when my ex wife, tori, and i were trying for kids we found out that i was infertile. we decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. i was thrilled because i thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. no, i was wrong. my ex wife cheated on me and i didn't find out until 20 years later. 

tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. my ex and i divorced a few weeks later. ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological father. he did and they started to become really close. it hurt me much more than i thought it would. 

he's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. they started to bond really well, and all of a sudden adam became really distant from me. it's been like this for almost a year and a half. i try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with chris (biological father). i tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. we used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about chris.

i couldn't stand it. my son who i raised since he was a baby treated me like i didn't matter. any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. what i mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. i'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. he also changed his major from econ to computer science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

i told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. he never did. i told him numerous times and he never changed. he was still distant.

what was the final straw for me was the phone conversation i had with him last week. he said he was going to change his last name to chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i told him this ""i can't believe you are going to do this. that's really disappointing to me. if you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then i'm no longer your father and i don't want to be involved in your life."" 

he hung up on me. i didn't even bother reaching out because i know he wouldn't respond. i stand by what i said. i meant every word and still do. the last name change to me means he no longer views me as a father and views chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

my family told me i'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. i was told to post it here. so reddit am i being an asshole?

info: something to add. after i found out about chris i took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or adam. they didn't contact me. i didn't contact them. i needed a break.

edit 2: a lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and i think i finally figured out why he's been so cold. a few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. his grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that i am fully in charge of. enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. after a semester of university he started dating this girl. he was head over heels in love with her. 

i never met the girl so i have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. suddenly after a few months of dating adam asked me for about $3k to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. i already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. i asked adam why he needed the money. he said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

i told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. he spent over 1k on her in just under a few months. he would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. to me she was just after my son's inheritance and i was right. what i said to him was basically this ""adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. that's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. if you 2 were more serious then i would think about it, but i'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. they broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

he was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. then we found out about my ex's affair. i don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. that was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",3

i'll start by saying that my wife and i don't have any sort of open relationship agreement or anything of that nature.  

we met on tinder 3 years ago, fell in love fast, moved in together, and got married. we've been married over 14 months now, and quite happily, i would say.

a month ago she left on a business trip for a week and i found myself downloading tinder on a particularly lonely night. i don't even know why. i didn't have any intentions. but i did it.

i swiped here and there and got pretty bored with it. it was a funny reminder of that time of my life. i deleted it and moved on.

on monday my wife left for another business trip. last night i once again downloaded tinder and started swiping. again, i had a laugh, but ultimately was bored of it. 

then i saw her picture come up.

i say shocked for a moment. i wondered if i should just delete it and pretend nothing happened. i thought maybe a bot stole her picture.... but i read her profile... it's her. it's her now and it's her live. there's even a picture of her where i am cut out.

i decided to make a bold move and swipe right. 

i swiped and we matched.

she gets back from her business trip tomorrow. i'm going to confront her then. i don't even know how this is happening. she's over 100 miles. is a friend of her using her account??

now i have to explain why i was on tinder. this is just a huge can of worms that got opened.

"by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think i was a heroin junkie. ever since i was a kid, i loved to fiddle around with staplers. playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. one of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. there are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes i'd break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. i've even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200b;

this progressed from me messing around with staples in ms. grady's second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. i had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? well...

&#x200b;

fast forward to present day. i am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. i have a home, a normal car, an office job. i am by all accounts a normal human being... **i still love staples.** working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. i'd spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. it got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200b;

so i had to stop doing that...i turned to amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. it wasn't enough. i went to 20, then 40. my wife got curious then and asked ""why are you buying all of these boxes of staples"". but i brushed it off as a work issue that i'd get reimbursed for and knew i had to change my methods.

&#x200b;

over the course of a few months i enabled myself...i started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. i would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. i began to stay out late and tell my wife i would be home soon, so i could go buy more staples from different stores. i opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn't know but she caught it in the mail. she got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200b;

this past thursday after one of my ""late nights"" i get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. i walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. because it is.

&#x200b;

my wife asked if there was anything i wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. i sat down and kept saying ""what are you talking about"" until my mom said ""honey, we saw the pictures"". then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. this man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me ""do something"" with what i had in the bag from multiple stores. it basically looked like i was a drug runner for office depot who was using some of the product for myself. at this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. i had to come clean and all i could muster was

the wtf looks i got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when i showed them my car....i came clean. i backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. right now my only concern is my dad. he didn't laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200b;

believe it or not, i think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. i may or may not do that, but the good news is i now can have a ""staple hour"" once i get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200b;

tldr: i have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought i was on drugs when it became a problem.

edit: 

thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! i am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. if you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, i just ask that you dm me/name the throwaway so i can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people's perspectives on my problem.

1. i went to see a therapist today with my wife. i was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, i do need help. i am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. just tailored to my specific issue.

2. apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. that included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. so after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. my wife initially thought i was having an affair. she didn't think i was doing drugs until she got the pictures. the pi just told her what he saw, and she deduced that i had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. she admitted that she didn't think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. i do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. i am just an addict, and an idiot. i know how stupid the addiction is and so i tried to hide it. it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things i guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",4
"update my best friend (20/m) at the time broke off our friendship 2 years ago because he said i (22/m) made him question his sexuality, and it still kills me everyday. edit: for those who keep asking, or inferring, that we're gay. neither of us are gay or have interest in a relationship between us. we talked, he isn't gay. his worry back then was that he put all his effort into spending time with me, and not into dating and branching out and i trust his word. thanks for all the kind words. 

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bvftkn/my_best_friend_20m_at_the_time_broke_off_our/)

i wanna start by thanking users u/maedocc and u/lalee_pop and everyone else for their advice in the comments. they, along with some advice from a 3rd person gave me the encouragement and strength to finally after 2 years reach back out to my best friend at the time. last friday night i drove back to visit my parents, and had noticed that my old friend was also back in town for the weekend. that was when i created my original post asking for advice, because something was telling me that was the time to reach out but i didn't know how. 

i decided to look through a folder of screenshots of stuff we had sent each other years ago, found a funny picture that he had drawn, and decided i would send that. i sent it, and said something like ""wow even 2 years later you were able to tell the future"". i waited, not knowing how he'd respond. eventually he did, and just gave a normal response. so i asked if a mutual friend's house was still the get together spot on saturday's, and he said yeah. he asked me if i was going to go, and i said probably. he responded with ""cool! i'll be there"".

that was the first time in 2 years that we talked for more than a sentence, and he seemed excited to hang out again. i was elated, i got so pumped up. we hung out all saturday and it was like the last 2 years didn't even happen. we didn't lose any chemistry, and we threw old inside jokes back and forth at each other like it was the old times. he then asked if i wanted to hang out sunday too! we hung out all sunday, and things started to feel like it was normal. 

then throughout this whole week while i was back in my normal city, with work, he initiated a lot of texting/snapchatting. that, to me, felt like that was the last step to things being normal. because it showed he wanted to talk to. eventually we both said that we had wanted to reach out earlier but were too stupid/awkward/anxious to reach out. so that gave us a little chuckle. so we basically wasted 2 years because we both were afraid to reach out. now we have been talking pretty much 24/7 all week, and it makes me so happy knowing i have my best friend/brother back in my life. it honestly feels like i'm a different person with him being around. thanks for all the advice!

**tl;dr - reached out to friend after 2 years of silence, ends up reconnecting incredibly easy while learning that we both wanted to reach out but never did out of idiocy and now things are back to normal.**",8

"for not honoring my son's punishment?. update 2: i told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going because it affects my custody time. yes, i told her it was okay but after her husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways, i had to crack the whip. let those two eat each other alive. they deserve each other.

update 1: this hilarious. my son's best friend mom emailed us an invite for a sleepover which is on my day. i was going to see if my son wanted to go, but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. i can react in so many ways...


his mom and i are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. cordial, but indifferent. our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.

we have 50/50. she requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. i agreed even though this ate into my time with him. apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. i won't see him for three weeks. i am not saying not to punish him. 

punish him when he's on their time. 

i have no problems with him when he's with me.

i refused.

i already made plans to make most if the days that i have him and i'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. i don't care much for step-dad anyways. what i do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. 

also, i don't want to set precedent where i am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.


edit: update: my son called him a ""freaking asshole."" my ex calls him the same thing when they fight. her words, not mine. he learned it from her, not me. i don't open share my dislike for her husband. maybe an eyeroll, but i'm too corporate and professional to do it in front of my son.",3

"if i started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?. i moved from georgia to the pacific northwest last year for a dream job after i graduated college. it was a little bit of a culture shock, because i went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. there hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. for example, every white woman i meet mentions beyonce to me within the first five minutes. when i was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'so... beyonce.'

so the problem in the post title is that i am the only black woman at my office, and i am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and i'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. my name is tina, short for christina. pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. for some reason, a handful of people at work call me tiana, tiara, or tia, i think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. i am most often called tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which i think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. the other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position i'm in) used to work there and i get called her name (mary) sometimes too. sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""how do you pronounce that?"" it's tina!

i have tried politely correcting this and i correct it immediately every time. from polite, ""just for the record, my name is tina!"" to lighthearted, ""tina, like tina belcher!"" in e-mails from me that say tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, i still get, ""thanks tiana!"" sooo... i'm considering doing the twitter approach, where i just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. like:

chuck: thanks, tiana

tina: no problem, chad!

jessica: hi tiara!

tina: good morning, jennifer!

would i be the asshole if i did this? i know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and i feel really disrespected by this, so i may as well have some fun with it.

edit: i am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so i just want to add a couple of things:

a lot of people have suggested that i gently and firmly remind people of my name. that's what i've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

a lot of people have suggested i go to hr. this is the kind of nebulous thing hr doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

a lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. it is. i have been black for 25 years, and i have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and i can identify it in my own life. it isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. i feel like a few people are almost getting it. a lot of people are referencing that key and peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

and finally, a few people have asked why i don't use tina turner as an example, since she's also a black tina. first, i thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with tina belcher, but i used 'tina turner' as an example for our dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me tina turner, which took deprogramming from his ea to get over.

edit #2:

no, i don't have a southern accent. i'm from atlanta, and black people from atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. more to the point, no accent makes the name 'tina' sound like 'tiana' or ""tiara""

no, the people i work with aren't just 'idiots.' as annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

no, i can't wear a 'hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. we have a business professional dress code!

yes, i correct them every time.

no, it's not because i'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

responding to this post saying, 'okay shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('tiana' being the 'shaniqua' in this instance). several people have alarmingly said, 'okay, trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'chad' is very weird!",3
"the gays taking the rainbow to represent their movement was a dick move. i'll preface this by saying i'm completely supportive of the gays.

the rainbow should belong to everyone. it represents color and art. it represents a beautiful and near-magical natural phenomenon. 

it was a dick move to take a symbol that had meaning to everyone and limit it to representing who you'd rather fuck or date. 

people used to display the rainbow freely because it's a beautiful thing— on clothes, on designs; i even remember an airplane company with a rainbow tail. now whenever it's displayed, it's associated with a political movement. 

also, they kinda stereotyped themselves with a flag that represents an embrace of flamboyance. not every gay is flamboyant, only the most outspoken ones that dominate the face of the community.

"mn a girl is planning to claim i am the father of her baby when we never had sex. i've been living in a foster home since january '18. i turn 15 in march. the foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. she blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. i never had sex with her, and i would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. the foster ""parent"" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.

i can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. i said i would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks i will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample. she is trying to gaslight me into believing something that never happened, probably because the real father is a real loser like her.",2
"i'm being sued by the at fault driver who doesn't know i have dash cam footage. hello, 

i got hit in brampton, ontario in october 2018. 

i'll try to keep it short! last october a driver ran a red light while she was making a left hand turn  (in a 2 lane left turning street) and hit me as i started going through the green. 

i called 911 but no one came because no one was injured so we got towed to the police station and made reports. no one got charged with anything, even though she should have imo. they didn't ask questions or care. no ambulance came, no major injuries. 

the insurance was easy, 100% not at fault for me, all her fault (as i was told is the case for 99% of these types of accidents, where one driver turning left hits a driving going straight). no issues what so ever, they paid off my car and that's it i moved on. 

fast forward about 5 months and i received mail that i believe was sent to my insurance company requesting a bunch of information and that she intends to take legal action against me for what i believe is lost wages, guess she got hurt. 

her police report is attached which includes what she says happened. it doesn't make any sense as she wrote ""he had the green and got hit by me making the turn on a yellow light"" 

the funny thing is, i don't think she knows a driver that was in the inside turning lane beside her stopped and gave me the dash cam footage he had. this footage shows he and the car in-front of him stopping for the red, and you can clearly see her car coming into frame in the outside turning lane on his right after the light is already red, she flies through the red and hits me as i'm moving forward at the green. all very clear on the footage. 

my question is, how can she sue if she's at fault? i'm sure i'll win a case with the footage i have, but what is the likelihood she will have to pay my legal fees? that's what i'm most worried about. 

any thoughts on this situation is helpful. 

thanks",2

"(texas) power of attorney seems fishy?. so, i'm 29 and my parents don't allow me to get a job or move out on my own and every time i try to, they threaten me with this. i do have mental disabilities, however i am fully functional and i also have never been diagnosed. this leads me to questioning the veracity of my parent's threats. i do remember my parents dragging me into an ssa office when i was younger and they made me sign some document without me reading it. they just told me to sign it without question and being my parents i didn't think to question them. later they told me that i had signed away my rights (their phrasing) and that they now have power over me. every time i try to run away they also threaten to call the cops and they tell me that since i'm disabled and i have no guardianship over myself, whoever i go to can be charged with kidnapping since my parents didn't consent. i'm also not allowed to have friends or anything because they use this to dictate my every move. they tell me i'm crazy and helpless and i can't be trusted and that's why for my own good they got this thing.

&#x200b;

other things that might be important that make my question things:

they don't care about my well being. they don't allow me to go to therapy even when i've asked. they refuse to allow me to see a doctor and when i finally did, they threw away my medication because they claim it was bad for me. i know for sure i do have a mental disability, i just don't know what and once again, they've never took me to get diagnosed let alone therapy. they've always been controlling and i wonder if this is just another method. i get too scared to call suicide hotline when i'm depressed because they had me convinced for the longest time that, quote, ""they'll lock you up in a mental asylum for life and take away your phone and never let you talk to the people you love ever again and they'll treat you like you're crazy."" i've since learned this is obviously not true, but it's ingrained in me now and i have a hard time seeking help. i feel that this is also yet another form of control.

&#x200b;

anyways, how do i go about verifying if they really do have this thing over me? what are their rights if this is true? what are my rights? can i, i guess appeal (not sure if this is the right word)? what can i do about this?

&#x200b;

is there any other legal advice y'all can offer that i haven't thought about asking for? can i do anything about how controlling my parents are, legally speaking? can they really deny me therapy and medical care?

i should also i add they sabotage any jobs i try to work because of the poa thing. i currently help my mother around the store they own and they pay me randomly and i'm not on any official payroll that i know of. is this also legal????

i have so many questions and i feel so helpless and lost. i'm sorry.

"by telling someone he had something on his trailer dragging. happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. 

i was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. i noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.

normally, i wouldn't think twice about it, but i was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn't want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. 

we pull up to a stop light, and i hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. apparently he didnt see me, because when i said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. 

being one who didn't want to escalate the situation, i let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. 

as i turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. the way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it's somewhat if a blind curve. 

as i'm walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. it didn't move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. 

she then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as i'm laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. the way she viewed it, i was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. 

the cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. 

tl;dr i stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car

"by making my wife think i killed myself. right off the bat i want to say that i am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. this was not a prank gone wrong, or something i did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. burner for reasons.

&#x200b;

this happened a couple of weeks ago. i tripped and sprained my ankle. it's been bothering me enough that i've been taking epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. in addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, i also find it incredibly relaxing. say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, i enjoy a good soak.

&#x200b;

i also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. it's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...i call them old man spots. they're harmless, and most of the time i don't even notice, but every once in a while...i'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. additionally it takes foreverrr to get the bleeding to stop...its not like i can elevate my balls, let alone put a band aid on...

&#x200b;

well...on the day in question, i get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. so, i get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. it's not really important how i did it, but i ended up nicking one of those spots. so, after cursing a reasonable amount, i start the lengthy ritual of holding tp against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. even after the bleeding stops i have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...well i finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. i put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&#x200b;

 i wasn't asleep but i was really zoned out and relaxed...until i was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. i've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. it scared the shit out of me, and i jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. i shouted ""honey? what the fuck!""  she didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  it took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""jesus christ!"".....i could see what it must look like to her... i had apparently not stopped the bleeding as well as i thought i had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&#x200b;

it took me a long time to calm her down, and i don't think that's something you just get over. hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though i thought i had. took a bath, zoned out. wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact i was bleeding into the water and thought that i had killed myself. sorry honey.

after the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. there was a fair bit of wine involved (i was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my fil let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate i still cuddled with my 15yo. i don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but i was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. to my surprise, my wife and mil both agreed with him.

i have a lot of respect for my in-laws, i get along with them great and i consider them closer than my own parents. obviously i'm quite fond of my wife as well, but i outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. i've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. they all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. aita?

"so how exactly did the playboy mansion work? did hugh hefner just hire attractive women to come in and live there? i don't understand. also why do some people hate hugh hefner so badly?. i'm young (21 years) and maybe i missed when playboy was a big thing. i know what it is but i don't know much about backstory. but even after looking it up i don't get some things. 

so basically how did the playboy mansion work? so a bunch of hot girls were selected to live with hugh hefner for a selected amount of time and get paid for it? 

i saw a post in the ""askwomen"" sub and they were all about how hugh hefner is a gross misogynistic guy who exploited women with the playboy magazine. this confuses me because it was my understanding that he did not force women to do the things women did for playboy. iirc these women in the playboy magazine and playboy mansion were consensually choosing to pose nude (which is not a bad thing: your body, your choice, do you) and be in the mansion. so why do some people hate hugh so badly? like what exactly did he do? and also how did the playboy mansion work?

"update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met. this is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

as a quick summary: i thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""joe"" and his wife ""kate."" after just a couple weeks, she was trusting joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to maggie's family thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. i thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or maggie had attachment issues.

i figured out what was going on and i feel like a huge idiot. i went to see maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if i didn't like what i heard i'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue i couldn't handle.

i had the opportunity when i saw the gifts maggie had gotten for joe and kate's kids. it seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

i asked maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to joe and kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for christmas.

i wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then maggie said that she used to exchange christmas gifts with joe and kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

i realized i was missing something important. if maggie had other christmases with joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like i thought. i had thought that maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but i didn't think maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. i didn't want to ask, so i acted normally until i left.

when i got home, i went through maggie's facebook. she wasn't lying and she's not crazy. i found a ton of photos with joe and kate going back a decade. from what i can figure out, they all went to college together, joe and maggie were big brother and little sister in a coed frat/sorority, and maggie and kate were roommates. i also found pictures of maggie as a bridesmaid in joe and kate wedding and pictures of maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. all of maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that i know all this.

i think this whole thing is my fault. i have adhd and i don't handle it well. i've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where i start zoning them out. i've been called out for this before. i think it's pretty likely that maggie did tell me about joe and kate and i just wasn't listening. maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so i think it's more likely that i wasn't listening when maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

this was a pretty big wakeup call for me. i've been ignoring my problem because i didn't want to face facts that it was serious but i know i need to do something before i make anymore mistakes. i'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",8

"update: i (21m) got my fwb (33f) pregnant and she's keeping it, i want to talk to her about other options.. this is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

well some time has passed.. and a lot has happened. my first post had a lot of comments and i got some pm's from people asking me what went down so that's why i'm updating.

so i didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because i realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. i didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and i shouldn't have done that. but i needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever i was going to decide would change my life so i needed some space, though i could have communicated a bit more (which i'm working on now).

anyways, i realized that i'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. i was stuck on the age gap, i kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when i thought of her. some comments really stuck with me and i decided to just trust my feelings. i ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. she was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how i felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. i'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. she completely lit up when i told her, i saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. she was ecstatic, i won't ever forget that. 

every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. i really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. we talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and i don't understand how it has all been so amazing. i know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. i moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, i had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. she has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. they got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. on top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl i've introduced them to. the pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. i'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, i'm really close with my parents. they are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. they fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

she's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. i've been trying to help her and support her any way i can, and did a ton of reading online to understand what's going on. i offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that i can keep going. we need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

so yeah... i'm going to a dad. she's gonna give birth to our kid.. still feels surreal to me, but i'm low-key kinda excited. it'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. i'm happy that i'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

edit: i don't need any pm's full of criticism, don't bother. just comment somewhere if you want to spit some nonsense",8

"by making a grown man cry at my work. i debated whether or not this belongs here cause it's more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. but my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

sidenote: this happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

i work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. i had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. he was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes i get who tend to speak down to me just because i'm a girl who works in a hardware store. anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so i said i could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. he agrees and he opens his wallet and i notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. trying to make conversation i decide to comment on it:
(op: me | og: old guy)

op: oh is that your granddaughter? she's so cute!

og: oh no... that's my daughter.

*fuck, i basically just implied this guy was old.*

og: oh cool! she's really cute! what grade is she in?

*guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

og: she's dead. she was hit by a car. a week after the picture was taken 

in my mind i fucking panicked. i literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. and this is what i came up with:

op: oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! it's too bad she died!

the guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. in record time i get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""have a nice day!"" and he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

guys. 

i told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

and that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" that's what my fucking brain came up with. 
fml.

tl;dr - subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**update: holy shit.**

i did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

to answer a few comments: 
*why didn't you just say 'i'm sorry' and move on?*

because that would of been the smart thing to say and as i have referenced, i am a complete and utter dumbass. also, i am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so i was trying to backpeddle as fast as i could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*why would you comment on the kids picture? that's weird.*

yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. but like i said i am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. this happened when i was still pretty new to the job and i had never worked in retail before so i wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. after this happened i learned my lesson and i have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*why do you work in customer service? you clearly don't belong in that department.*

like i said this happened a few years ago when i was still pretty new and i have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. i now train people for the job and i am also a assistant supervisor of the department. i usually tell newbies this story when i am training them so they don't make the same mistake as i did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*did you ever apologize to the guy?*

no, and that's the one thing i regret most of all. i've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. i truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. while i'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

"for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

so, i got into cornell last week. honestly i think it was fluke. i'm not smart, at all. i got a 28 act, a decent gpa (because my school grade inflates considerably). i had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like cornell. but anyways...

my twin sister is the opposite of me. she's a genius, she has way more impressive stats (34 act and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. i didn't and still don't mind, it's true. the only reason i can fathom i got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while i applied to arts and sciences (i don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (cornell). she checked as soon as it was available and called me bawling. i consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

well anyways, i pretty much resolved that i was getting rejected, so i didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. well, i guess surprises do happen sometime, because i'm a cornellian. i got in. i just don't know how but i did. 

i really want to go guys. but this would devastate my sister. all week she's been crying and solemn and sad. she's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  she's decided to go to nyu, but she just hasn't been herself. i haven't told our parents (i think they assumed i didn't get in because she didn't). 

am i being selfish? should i just go with her to nyc? we always thought we were going to school together but like... it's cornell. i couldn't in a million years imagine i'd get in. i've been researching obsessively about it and i can't shake the desire that if i don't go, i'll regret it. ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which i would love to get away with from the huge city that is new york). it seems like a dream opportunity. 

am i being a bad sister? i know she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. it would crush her. i really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. for going to her dream school? especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

tldr: dumb sister (me) gets into cornell. smart sister didn't. she's depressed. it was her first choice. i want to go tho. aita?

update: so everyone here told me that i should go, so i decided to tell my sister. 

well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't i tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

but seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. she went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. like uncontrollably bawling. i tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

i going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

update 2: please let me know if my updates are annoying; i only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so i thought least i could do is update 

so after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. it said:

> i'm sorry for how i reacted; please don't be mad. i'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. it's just that after i got rejected, i at least had the consolation that i get to go to school with you and we can go together. but now you're going to be where i wanted to be and i'm just so sad. i worked so hard and did everything i could to go to the best school i can and i just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. i'm sorry i'm ranting i just need more time

i'm not going to lie guys, when i read this, i cried. a lot of you are saying that i obviously i have to have attributes that made me desiresble but i really don't. i don't deserve my acceptance. i did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest ap classes available, etc. meanwhile i see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. she deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. i'm really strongly just considering going to nyu with her. everyone at cornell will just be just like her and i don't stand a chance. and i know if i go to cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and i just don't want to lose my sister :(

update 3: so i told my parents and they did not react how i would've expected them to. first, they tried to insist that cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be impossible; if we applied to the same school within cornell, like we both applied to arts and sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. they couldn't have mixed them up). 

then they went on to explain how i should go to nyu with my sister. i thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to cornell if i didn't get in. my sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would i not go to cornell, and they said how it was unfair that i basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. i don't know if i'm being dramatic, but that hurt. i knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that i don't deserve my spot sucks. even though they're probably right.

i stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. she asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that i 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. my parents were shocked because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. this started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. i'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. i realize that i have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. i'm glad i have my sister actually believe in me.

i still don't know if i want to go to nyu or cornell, mostly because i just don't want to go to school without her. she's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. at the end of the day, i always thought the nyu was going to be the school i was going to, so i wouldn't lose much by choosing it over cornell. i'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. thanks again everybody for your comments; i wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that i got in.

update 3.5: no new news but i just wanted to say that i'm reading every single comment and i apologize if i don't get to you individually and i appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! you guys are amazing :)",3
"by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.. recently, i traveled to denver, colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  as a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing i was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  what could possibly go wrong?

so the first thing i do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  and oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""are you looking for a mellow body high?  or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""yes, yes and yes!""  i reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  in hindsight, if i learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  sure, i can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite avogadro's number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

and it was at this dispensary that i also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and i were staying at).  as a result, before leaving, i begged my wife to buy some edibles that i could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  after expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

when we finally get back to the hotel room, i tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  what the fuck, denver?  seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that i should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" i read silently as i start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  but what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  so a second later, i covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

and then i quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  we may not have legal weed back home, but i routinely devour an entire package of milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

about 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  and that's when things start to go tits-up.  my stomach growls.  loudly and angrily.  my wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""diarrhea?""  but i merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""you didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""of course not."" i respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

a few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  i don't remember how i made it to my seat, and i don't remember even looking at the menu, but i do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if i was doing alright.

""keep it together, man,""  i say to myself.  but my wife's sudden groan suggests that i may have also said that to the waiter.  things are going downhill fast.

the waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

the moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  i start to worry that the jig is up.  

""you are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  not quite knowing what to do, i reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

at this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" i reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

my wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""bathroom. now."" she hisses. ""get it together.""  i reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  after splashing several handfuls of water on my face, i approach a urinal and start to pee.  

now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  as i am peeing, i start to get the very unsettling feeling that i have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

but deep down i know that is absurd:  i've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  i've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  so given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like i am about half way done -- that means that i've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

but the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  i try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

after finally finishing, i again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

next, i try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but i am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- i figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  to my wife's horror, i stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  but he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  he also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, i should probably eat one or two so that i'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

smart man. 

however, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, i start to get worried that i need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""do you think i should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" i suggest helpfully to my wife.

""what?! we literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

and at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""how many cookies did you eat?!"" she demands.

""whoa, easy there, torquemada,"" i respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""i had a few cookies, but keep it down.  i don't want your parents to know how fucked up i am right now.""

""really?!  they are sitting two feet away from you.  they know.""

i look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

tl;dr: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


edit:  wow!  thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  i think i have officially peaked in life.

as for part ii of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  at that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before i either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  so after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a secret service agent evacuating the president.  my night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  but being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",4

a little backstory. me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. i blame him for it and he blames me. i won't go into detail here. we ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. while this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. we rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. one thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. and unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. in the 8 years since we've been divorced i have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and i've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200b;

well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. his parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at disneyland and he want's to take the kids. well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. he asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and i shot him down. it's my week with them and i get to spend it with them. i told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that i need to ""think of them"". i told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200b;

well, this last sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. when i asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. when i asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to disneyland"". asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them i was not letting them go to disneyland with him. he's trying to paint me as the bad guy. i sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. my daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200b;

i'm not though. i think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. i demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"". 

&#x200b;

i'm so pissed right now. am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during my time with my kids? how is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",3

"for removing my birth control without consulting my husband first. sounds bad, but going to preface this by saying i'm not tryna get pregnant without my husbands consent 


i went to the doctor yesterday because i've been super emotional and my body has been out of whack and my doctor was basically like ""we gotta get this implant out of you"" (i had nexplanon, the implant in your arm) and i decided to give my body a break from hormones and to use condoms/ other methods for the time being because i don't want to conceive.


i call my husband and tell him and he's like ""oh ok did you get on the pill?"" and i said no, i didn't want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said i need to be on birth control because it's the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced i'm like trying to get pregnant without his consent. should i have called and discussed this with him since it effects him too (as in he has to wear a condom)

eta: if i hadn't of taken it out yesterday, i would have to wait a month because that was my gynos my next available appointment. so it wasn't that i didn't want to consult my husband, it was kind of a quick decision.


eta #2: i have a fucked up cervix so i can't have an iud, can't use tampons, lots of stuff.


eta #3: i believe now he is the asshole; it's not normal for a husband to react this way, and he kinda sucks anyway. thank you for the support and the judgement (even the dude who messages me i was basically just a sex doll)",3
"my (29f) husband (31m) is no longer attracted to me after an accident that burnt my face.. my husband and i have been happily married for 6 years and he has been nothing but a kind, attentive and caring spouse whom i love very much.

i attended a christmas party hosted by one of my friends where someone who had too much to drink decided to set off fireworks indoors. i was stuck on the first floor when the fire broke out and suffered third degree burns to my face and chest.

my husband has been extremely supportive and caring, helping me through all the hospital visits, the surgery and taking care of me while i recover. i just cant look at myself in the mirror as my face looks really bad and disfigured and i can tell he feels the same way too even though he keeps reassuring me it doesn't matter. he just looks differently at me now.

the other night we tried to be intimate for the first time and he just couldn't get it up. he kept saying he was sorry and that he still loved me very much but he cant help it. i know he meant it so i just cried myself to sleep that night.

the next week we tried again and the same thing happened. he then told me he wasn't attracted to me anymore and that he couldn't help it. it was soul crushing to hear that. he tries though. he cuddles me, hugs me, and keeps telling me it will all be all right.

is there anything i can do to make him think i'm beautiful again? but how how can i if even i don't think i am?

tldr: i was in an accident that burnt half my face off and my husband no longer finds me attractive",8
"girlfriend's little brother used my collection of '64 kennedy half dollars to buy drugs. my girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. he lives with us (we are both late 20's and have ft jobs).

i have been stacking 1964 kennedy half dollars for ten years now. for those that don't know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

i had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

i insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like i mentioned. whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that's what her brother thought he was stealing. and according to her ""he only got $100 of weed so that's fair"". okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? what then?

she also called my silver stack ""useless and paranoid and stupid"". i collect them partially for a store of value incase of inflation or deflation, but i also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

i guess i'm looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they're worth for the value of silver. it also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?",8

yesterday, it was just me and her at work, and she asked if i was doing anything later. i told her i was probably just gonna play video games or something and she asked me if i want to go to the arcade with her. i said yes, under the assumption we would go as friends. would i ***want*** to go on a date with her? absolutely. but i knew im way out of her league and didnt want to embarras myself. regardless, the plan is set. after work i would meet her at her apartment and we would to go the arcade in our local mall.

i go home and shower, change clothes, get ready etc. i drive over to her apartment and text her, she tells me her door is unlocked and to come in. i walk in, and shes in her bathroom doing her hair in her bra and underwear. i kinda back out the door, but she tells me to come back in, and that i always see her in a two piece swimsuit. touche.

she's getting ready and were just talking about work and she lays on her bed and says ""my neck is killing me.. i need a massage!"" i kind of laugh, and then she asks me if ""i give good massages"", while giving me this look. heres where the fuckup occurs:

my dumbass says ""i think theres a massage kiosk at the mall where the arcade is!""

10 seconds later i realised what i just did. 

she sighed and finished getting ready silently and we went to the arcade.

she was practically silent the whole night. the next day at work (today), she didnt mention anything of it.  i still cant believe i cockblocked myself.

"defaming a historical figure for their ""blatant racism"" is stupid. if you were around during the 19th century, you'd be just as racist as anyone else.. so much stuff on the web these days about how so-and-so should deserve to have all of their accolades taken back because they were racist. no shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. it's just how things were. despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

it's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. we would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

note: this post inspired by a twitter rant about hp lovecraft's overt racism... who the fuck cares. dude was a good writer; his views were a product of his time. get over it.

&#x200b;

edit: my inbox hurts. thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. also, i get it, lovecraft was *particularly* racist. still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. separate the art from the artist.

edit 2.0: this *really* blew up... thanks to everyone who came here to actually discuss this in an intellectual capacity rather than hurling accusations of being a white supremacist at me. i've barely had time to address any comments, but i've enjoyed reading them. if you're seeing this as a ""justification of racism,"" you're exactly part of the group of problematic people i'm talking about who want to pressure wash history with a broad stroke. it's important that we take into consideration the norms of the time when discussing the merits of our forefathers. as several people have mentioned here, it's really best to grade everyone on a curve based on what was normal at the time.

"was i(25m) wrong for telling my wife (24f) ""if i'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."". first, some back story. sorry, little bit of a long one. my wife(24f) and i(25m) have been married for almost two years, but have been together for over seven years. shortly after we moved in together, about two years into our relationship, i learned my wife has an issue with getting these whiskers that grow on her chin. she told me it was because of a hormonal imbalance, but she was very good at plucking or waxing them so i wouldn't notice. she was very self conscious about them, so she tried to make sure they weren't present as often as possible. i completely understood that it was out of her control that it occurs, and i hardly even noticed because she kept on top of it so well.

day one of when we started dating, she made it very clear to me that she hates beards on the men that she's with. she thinks they're very unattractive. well, not on every guy. she likes beards on certain actors. but definitely not on me. so i have stayed clean shaven for her. if i even forget to shave, even for a couple days, she won't even kiss me because she hates the beard that much. she'll usually comment on it multiple times a day until i do shave. progressively getting worse until i do the deed. but it's whatever, having to shave often doesn't bother me. i'm in the habit now of shaving every day or at least every other. if i could, i'd probably try to grow it out and see how i look with a legit beard, but my wife would definitely not allow it.

back to the my wife's whiskers: since we've gotten married, my wife has gotten.. comfortable. these whiskers of hers; she now goes weeks, even a month + without plucking them. after a whole month, these 5-10 whiskers are as long as the hair on my head (i have average length hair). now, i love my wife to death, no matter what she looks like, i want that to be clear. but these whiskers: i'm not a fan of them. they're not soft, barely visible hairs, they're long, shiny, and resemble thick fishing line.

she gets on me about my appearance, especially my facial hair. after a month of her not taking care of her issue, i finally said in the most loving way i could ""hey, babe, your whiskers are getting kinda long. your coworkers might notice, maybe you should pluck them or something?"" she got quite offended. but, she took care of the problem. a few weeks go by, and once again, she let her whiskers get long. i make another suggestion that she should take care of them, this time, she completely shrugs me off. says she's ""too tired and will do it later."" keep in mind, she bought a handheld battery operated hair puller thing for this very purpose. it gets rid of the problem in under 20 seconds. i make a suggestion again a few days later, adding in very kindly that i love her, and don't much care how she looks, but i'm not a fan of them. which again, she was offended, but took care of it. now i'm stuck in this cycle of she let's it grow, i suggest to get rid of them, she ignores me, then i have to mention it more and more times before she does something about it. always getting pissed off that i dare say something. it's at the point where if i don't say anything, she won't do it.

a few days ago. she was ripping me a new one because i wanted to have sex, but i haven't shaved my beard for a few days, and she didn't want to do anything since i was ""too scruffy."" it's been about three weeks since she's plucked her whiskers so they're at least an inch long. i snap and say ""this is bullshit, i shave almost every day for you. to look my best for you. but you won't get rid of those things on your chin once every couple weeks for me, even though i've kindly told you i don't like them."" and i finish with ""if i'm not allowed to have a beard, neither are you."" needless to say, she was incredibly pissed and we did not have sex that night. we're okay now. i've shaved since then. she has not.

was i wrong to have said this? was i wrong to look at this as a double standard? should i have approached this differently?

* update 1: some of you recommended laser hair removal or a similar permanent hair removal process. we have talked about laser hair removal in the past for her. she seemed interested, at first, but then made an excuse along the lines that she'd ""have to go back for multiple sessions and doesn't have the time for that."" i haven't tried to bring it up since.
* update 2: some are asking if it's the look of the beard or the fact it's rough and scratchy she doesn't like. in this case, both. she says she doesn't like how i look with a beard. i've never had a beard while i've been with her, so how she came to that conclusion, i do not know. hell, i don't even know what i look like with a legit beard. earlier in the relationship, if i had stubble, and kiss her, she'd comment that it ""scratches and it's uncomfortable."" which frankly, i understand. but then it evolved to her avoiding the kiss all together.
* update 3: pcos. yes, she has it. she's known she's had it for a long time. i believe she was diagnosed with it before, or shortly after we first met. the hair growth probably is a side effect, and she has always handled it well. up until recently.
* update 4: everyone recommending i should post this in /r/amitheasshole. no can do. that sub has a 3000 character limit. my post far exceeds that. feel free to tell me if i'm the asshole here if you like.
* update 5: thank you to those of you that have commented, or reached out to me, on different medications or procedures she could try that would help. i will definitely mention these to her. when the time is right of course. i appreciate you folks.
* update 6: an **overwhelming** majority have suggested saying to her ""*i'll shave when you do.*"" that works for me. i'll definitely have an update to how that conversation goes.
* update 7: ""*you shared this story with your guy friends!? you're a monster!*"" but sharing my story with thousands of strangers online is okay? lol. i actually went into **far more** detail with you fine folks. i only shared this argument with two of my very close friends. and i only mentioned the bits about her getting on me about shaving my own beard. not the personal bits about her. not that i need to defend myself, but there you go.

"by smoking on my apartment balcony (this happened saturday and was without question the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life). this is long and will have a tldr at the bottom.

saturday night my gf and i had my parents over for a  game night. we just moved into our new place last week monday and wanted them to see it. we were waiting on my brother who was running late so i decided to have a smoke on my balcony. 

everything is normal for the first few minutes. i'm just playing some ""free"" game i've spent way too much money on and not aware at all of my surrounding. then it happened. a bug flew in my ear. now this happens occasionally. a bug will fly and hit my ear and be on its way, but this little bastard decided my ear was going to be its new home and dug deep.

i immediately lost all semblance of self control and flung my phone and the chair i was sitting on and sprinted into the apartment while freaking out. the bug was digging or chewing and vibrating and that sound and feeling against your ear drum has to be the worst thing you can ever experience. my gf freezes, my father tells me to get in the shower and just fill my ear with water. i'm helpless at this point so i just follow my dads instructions. 

the bug did not like the water. it dug deeper. the noise and feeling got worse. i used a qtip to try to dig it out. all i got was blood. my father took a used water bottle from my recycling, poked a hole in the cap and used that to try to directly flush the bug. nothing but more digging and moving. i am literally screaming everytime it moves. both from the pain and the disgusting feeling i got when i felt it. 

my mother at this points takes off to run to a store to grab something she thinks will help. i barely notice she leaves but i hope to god she will save me. in the mean time, my gf reads that a couple of drops of vegetable oil can suffocate the bug. so my dad opens our brand new bottle of oil and dumps it in my ear.   at this point my entire body is covered in oil. i could have used concrete as a slip in slide. i'm naked in my shower with a bug in my ear, topped of with oil, holding the shower curtain over my crotch trying to keep some bit of modesty all why freaking out at the chewing next to my brain. 

the oil does nothing but piss it off. we are talking about going to the hospital when my mother returns. she has what looks like the top of a turkey baster. apparently this is something used to suck out booger's from babies noses. my father tries to use it at first because my limbs no longer work. he doesn't go deep enough because he doesn't want to pop my ear drum. i didn't care at that point because the bug was using it as an actual drum already so i managed to regain use of my arm, grabbed the thing and jammed it in my ear. it sucks the bug but it's too big to get it out. too heavy for it to hold onto. 

my gf then fills it with water and suggests i use that to flush the bug. after 4 attempts, i finally feel some relief. i look down on my chest and see something far bigger than i expected. at this point i'm too freaked out to look closely and yell for her to look. she freaks because it's a moth. a good size moth. i again nearly shit myself and rinse it off. 

i can not do justice to this event in words. i can not accurately describe the noise, the feeling, the horror of this. picture it yourselves. imagine you have a dime sized bug in your ear scratching, biting, chewing, digging. then realize it actually feels worse than that. 

if this was punishment for committing crimes, we would no longer need jails. 1 day with a bug in your ear would be enough punishment for murder and i can promise you they wouldn't do it again. 

i'd rather be waterboarded while listening to barney on a loop. those terrorists had it easy. 

i now wear my girlfriends bright pink beats headphones out while smoking and am strongly considering quitting. it shook me that much. 

tldr: a bug flew in my ear while i was smoking. stayed in there for half an hour while i tried everything conceivable to get it out. i finally did. it was more horrific than you can imagine.

edit: i've tried to keep up with the comments so i'll answer some of them here.

i'm still flushing my ear regularly with peroxide. this morning i still found what i think is moth wing residue. i've made an appointment with my primary doctor for 130 this afternoon (eastern time zone us). i'll keep you posted on the egg situation haha. 

i'm now smoking a lot less and mostly when i'm driving . i feel like god would be after me if a bug managed to find its way in my ear driving down the road with the window down only a few inches. 

i didn't expect this to blow up but to everyone commenting saying it happened to them, i'm sorry. i feel your pain. 

to those saying moths don't bite, i'm not exactly a bug expert. all i know is the feeling, the sound, the blood, it was doing something in there that id really rather never experience again. it's truly an indescribable feeling and one i hope you never have to experience.",4
"accidentally 'drink and dashed' yesterday, would it be stupid of me to go back today and pay the tab? (eu). so there's this bar me and my bf semi-regularly go to, recently they changed the way they serve drinks. you used to have to go to the counter, order, they gave you your drink, you paid then and there, done. now they have a server who goes to your table and it all works like in a restaurant. except yesterday we kinda forgot that when we finished our drinks (a cocktail and a beer, about $4 all in all) and left. this morning it kinda occurred to my bf that we forgot to pay.

i know morally going back and paying is the right choice. but what if they won't take the money and instead want to get the cops involved? because right now they don't have any identifying information of us aside from descriptions, but if i go back and essentially confess, that's pretty damning, so should i go back and pay our tab?

edit: this all happened in eastern europe, part of the eu.

update: i felt really guilty so i went back there around opening hours. they were extremely above and beyond nice about it. apologized and explained the situation. they said it was nice of me to come back, but there was nothing missing from the till so there's no bother. i'm pretty sure we didn't pay so i insisted, but they were like ""don't sweat it, if you really didn't pay then this round was on the house."" tbh i'm so embarrassed i probably won't go back there for a long while, but i am glad i tried to do the right thing.

"for wanting a sunrise wedding?. every year on our anniversary, my fiance and i wake up early to go to the beach and watch the sunrise together. it's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. 

we decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). after that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day. our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from canada, but that's unavoidable.

based on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.

i saw the condoms in his clear ziploc bag (note: plainly visible, i did not open or snoop through anything) of toiletries so of course i asked about them. his response was that he always keeps them in there and didn't bother taking them out for the trip.

reddit, i watched him combine otc meds from two bottles into one bottle to save space on this trip. i don't think anything in his bag is in there by ""accident."" but now he's giving me the silent treatment and acting like i ruined new year's for asking this. 

for being (and remaining) suspicious of this?

edit: he has never cheated previously, doesn't know anyone in this country and is going there for a fairly intensive field research project. i don't believe he has an active plan to cheat. i am, however, upset, because to me the act of bringing condoms is an active refusal to close the door on the possibility of intimacy with someone else if the opportunity happens to arise.",3

"a woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon..... a woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. as she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. 

after a moment or two, the vet 
shook his head and sadly said, ""i'm sorry, your duck, cuddles, has passed away."" 

the distressed woman wailed, 
""are you sure?""
""yes, i am sure. your duck is dead,"" replied 
the vet.. 

""how can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""i mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. he might just be in a coma or 
something."" 

the vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. he returned a few minutes later 
with a black labrador retriever. as the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. he then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 

the vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. a few minutes later he returned with a cat. the cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. the cat sat
back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

the vet looked at the woman and said, ""i'm sorry, but as i said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 

the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and 
produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

the duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

the vet shrugged, ""i'm sorry. if you had just taken my word for it, 
the bill would have been $20, but with the lab report and the cat scan, it's now $150.""

"my sister is in some weird cult - mi. no, that is not clickbait and i am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

okay. so my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. she came across a craigslist posting by a woman i'll refer to as aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. i never saw the ad, but i remember my sister telling me about it at the time. she was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. so she began a correspondence with ""aileen"". i did not live with my sister, i'm older by 5 years so i was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

so she ends up going to this place last august, i think, maybe early september. i have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. i was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. that right there was the first time i thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so i didn't push it.

over time, the tone of her emails changed. she would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""aileen"" much. then it gradually became that ""aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""aileen"" made her take drugs. seriously disturbing stuff. i told her she needed to get out of there, that i'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

i didn't know what to do at that point. i thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and i trusted her judgment at the time. it's not like i had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, i didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. yes, i was tentatively concerned, is what i'm trying to say, but i felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

my sister emailed me yesterday and i don't feel like that is the case anymore. something had happened and from what i was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. my sister was forced to participate in this. she seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. i don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

i stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but i couldn't figure anything out. i know my sister took a greyhound to lansing and aileen picked her up from the bus station, so i think this freak show is probably in either eaton, or ingham but as to more specifics, i have no idea. i don't think my sister even knows. i have a hunch they're in, or around mason because aileen made the kids spend the night at seven gables, but other than that i'm coming up empty.

i know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but i really need to know what to do. how do i handle this situation?  

good update: i did what a lot of people suggested with the ip address. i would have never thought of it, i'm not very tech savvy. she is in mason or at least uses that library. i'm going to contact the police there. you guys are rockstars.",2
"(update) my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile. link to original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6fd8u/my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me_feel/)

&#x200b;

i don't know what the hell has happened but things have turned into an absolute clusterfuck.

i received some really great advice from people and honestly thought talking to him was going to work out well. i was still pretty nervous though and not sure how to bring it up. his mood has been pretty touch and go lately so i was worried about picking the right moment and kept putting it off until later in the night when he tried initiating sex and i thought that was a good time to start the conversation.

i basically said i know you've noticed something's been off lately and thats because i haven't been entirely comfortable during sex since you got your new tattoo. i absolutely love it for what it is and what it stands for but it's just difficult for me to stay in the moment because it's really hard not to look at it and be reminded of what happened. i stopped here to see what his reaction would be so far and he was just silent for awhile and then said ""so... what? you want me to get rid of him?""

i ***explicitly*** said ""no i would never ask you to do that"" and then told him it might just take me some time to get used to it until its not so noticeable anymore and in the meantime maybe he could keep his shirt on during sex or we could try some other ideas. this is where shit started to hit the fan. he said all that sounded ridiculous to him and that i was being extremely insensitive and selfish and ""honestly sick' for even associating his little brother with sex and asked if i was fucking sick in the head.

i fucked up here. i shouldn't have said this but i don't handle confrontation well and i pretty much lost my cool at this point. i told him to go jack off to a picture of his brother and tell me how that makes him feel. he completely exploded at this point saying that was a disgusting thing to say (i agree) and started calling me a number of names. he then started to get extremely personal saying i never cared about his little brother and that i'm probably happy he's out of the picture.

that is hand down the most hurtful thng he has ever said to me. i still cant bellieve it and i don't think i'm ever going to forgive hm for that. like seriously what the fuck? just thinking about it is makng me fucking shake. he knows exactly how i feel about his brother and how hard his death was for both of us and for him to stil say something like that? he can seriously go fuck himself because i'm definitely not gonna be doing it anymore.

he then started shoutng that if it was seriously that big of a deal for me that he would get the whole thing layered off but he hopes i know i'm basically killing his brother all over again??? i was crying so much at this point i didn't get a chance to respond before he stormed out of the house and just took off. i have no idea where he's gone or where he is and i honestly don't even know if i care at this point. he's not answering his phone or responding to any messages.

i still can't believe he reacted the way he did. he was like a completely different person. not once in the four years i've know him out of all the arguments we've had has he ever spoken to me like that before. i was up all night on the phone to my sister and she was just as shocked as i was.

then this fucking morning i get a lovely fucking call from my boyfriend's sister who called me disgusting and heartless and evil for forcing him to remove the tattoo. apparently he's been going around to his family and alllour friends telling them i've given him an ultimatum of me or his tattoo.

what the fuck?!?! i explicitly told him i would never ask him to do that. when i told his sister this she just called me a lying fucking bitch, wished all my siblings dead and then hung up. feckin lovely.

i seruiously don't know why he's reacted the way he has or why he's going around lying about me making him get rid of it. i'm still in total shock and just so confused. i hoped typing all this out would help me figure things out a little but reading this over has just made me angrier. i don't see what i could have done differently? i shouldn't have made the jack off comment, that's clearly what set him off but that doesn't explain why he's lying now to everyone.

i'm just at a complete loss right now. a day ago i thought of this guy as my future husband and now i just don't know. i wish i never said anything.

i've spent four years of my life with this guy but this is a side of him i've never seen before. im so upset right now my imeddiate thought is to just cut things off completely. how the fuk would we even move froward from this? am i the one in the wrong here for the comment i made? i know i shouldn't have said it but i personally think he completely overreacted to it. and how am i supposed to convince our friends he's the one lying here? anything i sy is just going to sound like i'm lying in response to their negative reactions. i seriously have no idea what im supposed to do here. i feel like this is going to ruin my life.

i just don't fucking know.

"by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend. i have grapheme-color synesthesia. basically i see letters and numbers in colors. the letter 'e' being green for example. a couple months ago i was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. he asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what i said a few months ago. always being the sameish as course. he still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe i just memeroized them really really well.

tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. i tried explaining to him i just see the colors automatically when i visualize the letters in my head. i asked him what colour are the letters in his head. he looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

my boyfriend didnt understand what i meant by visualizing the letters. he didn't believe me that i can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. when he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. he can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. he thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... its crazy to him the fact that i can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

now i have a boyfriend that is really upset. he feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. he's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing i wasnt pulling his chain. hes pretty upset and i feel really bad. 

tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (cant visualize anything at all)

edit; oh wow this blew up. i just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. he never thought i was lying. i think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",4

she sits up and says ""are you fucking serious?!"" at this point i'm completely lost. i just sat there and she says ""as a pet... that's it?"" i said ""i mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?..."" she says ""still love me like you just claimed that you did, it's funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey i would still love you unconditionally and i would not treat you like 'a pet'"" .... i had no idea what was going on and how we even ended up in this argument. i just said "" if you were a donkey how else was i supposed to love you aside from being a pet?? am i supposed to treat you like my girlfriend still??"" she says ""i'm not saying you would have to take a donkey on a date.. but you knew it was me so why would your love me suddenly change just because of my appearance?!"" ... i just stopped talking because i didn't want to say anything else wrong.

"the word ""moist"" isn't gross. the circlejerk over it is ridiculous.. there seems to be this meme of the word *moist* being inherently disgusting and creepy, and i don't get it. is ""damp"" really a better word to use? what sounds more appetizing, a *moist* cake or a *damp* cake?

personally i think the words *petulant* and *hemorrhage* are a little bit gross-sounding, but they are words for a reason and i'm not going to throw a conniption fit if somebody uses them. it's not like they're slurs.

edit: i might have been a bit harsh in my wording. i know it's just my opinion, and some people are grossed out by it. i understand why some people have a negative association with the word, but i just don't associate it with bodily fluids unless it's used in that context. obviously i'm not going to double down on using it if it truly does bother somebody. i'm not an asshole.

however, the mere potential of comical joy to be experienced was wasted on such a mundane destiny, and thus i proceeded to stick the suction end to my forehead and become the unicorn i was meant to be... i had reached my comical peak. as we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead i could feel something was terribly wrong. 

i heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. upon my forehead i had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. the curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm. 

i leave for italy in 8 hours for my summer holiday.... my friends won't be able to look at me in the eyes. i fear for what the security at the airport may think of my battle wound.

yesterday i got invited to her place, things were going great... she turned on the tv and we were watching some movie about poverty-stricken family, in the plot it was around christmas time.

after a few minutes there was a part where the family was eating christmas dinner. my girlfriend made a nasty comment which was something like: ""look at that crap dinner."" i didn't really react to her comment.

the mother in the movie brought the turkey and my girlfriend said ""that looks like cow's placenta."" that's when i sat up and said ""are you serious?""

i told her that not everyone has the luxury of a ""fancy"" christmas dinner, i told her to look at the real image, they have at least they have their significant others, it's not about the presents and all after all...

then she said something along the lines of: ""yeah, that money you spent on food to donate to charities on christmas day could have been used to fund me a better gift.""

"for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?. so this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so i figured i would bring it to the group to see if i'm the asshole or not.

my boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  i absolutely hate it because i am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

for an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  we live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  we were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

a few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, i told my boyfriend that the event started at noon, not 1:00.  and just as i figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  we show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

so last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  i had lied about what time the event started.  i know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if i can lie about something like that, whose to say what else i'd be lying about.  i told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that i don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if i'm 'hiding something'.  i explained that i only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  in my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

he doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one i lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

i've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but i just have to know if i'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.

"the word ""retarded"" shouldn't be offensive. the fact that society is shying away from ""the r-word"" is proof of the so-called euphemism treadmill. basically, by replacing ""retarded"" with something else, we're just kicking the can down the road and it's a matter of time before the new word becomes offensive. 

not that long ago, the term ""retarded"" was considered a kind and politically correct way to replace words like ""idiot"" and ""imbecile"" (those were actually medical terms 75 or so years ago). 

the term ""special"" or ""special needs"" is probably the most common way of replacing ""retarded,"" but even those terms are becoming offensive (for example, conservatives sometimes derisively call progressives ""special snowflakes""). 

obviously human decency should prevent us from making fun of those with mental disabilities, but it just isn't necessary to tip-toe around those clunky terms that become offensive after a few years.

"for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?. i have waited tables for the last three years.

during my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. they were a pleasure to have as customers. they ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

when i was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, i walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. when i rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. i figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. they ordered their entrees and i went off to handle other tables.

about five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. at this point i started getting concerned, but i took the order and cheerfully said i'd be right back. this time, i went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. he was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, i told him to just trust me. 

a few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and mrs. pregnant woman was also getting into it. i figured that since she didn't notice, things were ok. the problem came when i took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. when mrs. pregnant woman got to the counter, i saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). my bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

it was too late for me to edit them back, so i just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. they all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. they were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an uber.

several minutes later mrs. pregnant woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. i fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. she blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. i said no, but told her that i assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. it was a lame lie and i'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. i did so. then she talked to my manager. my manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

i stood my ground and told her that i'm not going to be responsible for fas. she told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. she also informed me that i could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

but when i talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. the entire staff at the restaurant is against me and i think that i'm going to call in and tell my manager that i quit, but i still feel in the right here. i would like some perspective on this and if i'm the asshole here.",3
"for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a japanese downpour?. my friends and i went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

we're from england, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in japan. it is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. i warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. they were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

i warned them multiple times that if it rains, i would not let them borrow my umbrella.

one friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. i reminded them that i would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

roughly an hour later, it started raining. hard. it was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. i stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). when we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. neither were particularly happy.

"for ruining both my parents marriages for disowning me?. i am the  by-product of my parents extra-marital affair. both of them had spouses at the time. my birth-mother got pregnant and had to tell her husband as he was overseas when i was conceived so there was no way i was his. a few months after i was born they decided not to divorce. i was given to my grandparents on my mothers side to raise with my birth father secretly paying child support without his wife's knowledge.

both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that i am adopted by my grandparents. recently i decided that i wanted to know more about my dad's family and i sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so i could get to know him. well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over skype. they both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

well i did pretty much the opposite. i contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. she is now divorcing him while on my mother's side i told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother. 

currently my siblings on both sides lives have been upturned and after the satisfaction has worn off i feel like i unnecessarily hurt them through my parents. for ruining my parents marriages?",3

"by having my roomate walk in while i was practicing cowgirl riding.... oof

my roommate told me that she was going to be out of town for a week and would be back on sunday night. she usually always follows her schedule and never deviates from it.

a week ago, i ordered a dildo that had a suction cup base, and was roughly the size of my boyfriends. i don't particularly like using my toys when my roomie is home, on the off chance that she somehow hears me or whatever. so this was fucking fantastic and i was ecstatic.

my plan was to use the living room space and use one of my smaller tables, so i could sit on it and act like it was my bf. i'm not really experienced in the sex department and i wanted to make a good show for his upcoming birthday so i was going to practice until she got back.

before i get into the main event. i need to explain the layout of this house. when opening the front door, you walk right into the mud room which has a swinging door that used to squeak, we don't wear shoes in the house only slippers or socks. after leaving the mudroom you're in the kitchen and around the corner and across the hall is the living room.

since the swinging door used to squeak we'd know when someone was here if we heard the noise. however since we got it fixed it's silent.

now on to the main event. i had set up the living room, with my small table in the middle, a chair in front of me to so i could balance and my 'sexy time' music on low, with the lights dimmed. then i pulled out my new toy and i literally smashed that fella on the table and made sure it stuck.

then i got dressed down to what i would be wearing. it was just a long ass tshirt that hit my knees, but underneath i had my lingerie, i did this so i would be in the head space and so i could i imagine the upcoming day.

at this point i'm on the toy and i had a pretty good groove going and i was thinking okay it's not that hard, but my hips were sore so i grabbed some pillows to support, and then i heard a noise. i fucking froze and turned around and it was my cute pupper! i shoo'd him out and continued.

another couple minutes go by and i can hear my dog get the zoomies and playing with her toy running back and forth with it. until i realized, that how the fuck was she fetching something she can't even throw. i then heard the suitcase rolling from the kitchen to the hallway and i felt my entire body flush and get immediately sweaty and my heart rate skyrocket. i heard the suitcase stop and when it did i hopped my body off and grabbed the dildo to pull it off, but that fucker didn't budge. i was doing some mad calculations in my mind to try and explain this...

lightbulb!

my shirt is long enough, my unides are crotchless and she'll never be able to tell! i sat myself right back down, turned the tv on rick and morty, put a pillow up on the fucking chair and acted like i had been watching this the entire night.

she came in and saw me and asked why i was sitting like that and i made some bullshit up saying my back hurt and i was just letting it stretch out. she nodded and then plopped her ass on the couch. now this would've been okay, if it wasn't for the fact that i was sitting on a dildo and leaning forward in a position that was starting to get uncomfortable.

we sat there for 2 hours and she never even got up. she told me she came back early since she finished up her work early and we chatted for a bit until the show ended and then she picked the handmaids tale.

at this point i'm so sore and by sheer will i'm keeping it together, because this would be incredibly awkward at this point to get up and act normal.

the moment comes when she says she's hungry and ask if we want to order in. i reply with gusto and tell her to run up stairs and grab our menue folder in her room. she does and as soon as she's on the first step up,  i pop off this joint and sprint my ass down the hallway to my room and place the table in my closet and get the stubborn dildo off and toss it in my shower.


tl;dr: tried to practice my cowgirl riding on a dildo, and forced to sit on it for two hours, until my roomate left to get our menu folder.

update 1: thanks so much for the lovely gold! it's my first one and it makes me happy! for the record, i am sore, and it's a bit uncomfortable. i haven't told my bf yet since i'm still a bit embarrassed! but i'm planning on telling him on the day. also, my roommate had no idea, because there's no way she'd pass up to joke about it.

update 2: since it's being asked alot, the reason i was not in my room was because at the time it was messy. i was rearranging and packing up some of old stuff. so there were boxes and all that jazz.

"unattractive people should learn to accept that they're not attractive rather than delude themselves that they are.. ""everybody is beautiful to somebody."" 

""ugly doesn't exist."" 

""everybody is equally attractive in their own way."" 

""looks don't even matter. what's on the inside determines whether you're attractive or not.""

""you're perfect just the way you are."" 


these quotes amongst many others are constantly fed to unattractive people. it's like everyone needs to believe they're attractive or else. god forbid anyone ever see themselves as less-than-beautiful. 

but... why? is being unattractive that bad? is attractiveness a person's only value to humanity? are the lies necessary?

sure, in a utopia, everybody would be attractive to everybody and no one would be considered ugly. but alas, this is planet earth and life isn't fair. some people are born with attractive features; some are not. some are born with blatantly unattractive features. yes, that's nobody's fault, but that's just the way it is. 

before you say ""beauty is subjective"", you can't deny that certain features are innately and universally attractive to human beings. for men they would be tall height, broad shoulders, full hair, clear skin, and facial symmetry+harmony. for women: clear skin, full hair, hairlessness, facial symmetry+harmony, and a good waist-hip ratio. aside from certain fetishists, i've yet to meet a man or woman who did not strongly prefer these features and dislike their opposites. 

not only would people stop lying to themselves if they accepted their unattractiveness; they would no longer have to wonder ""what am i doing wrong?"" when they find that others don't view them how they view themselves.",6
"for posting a tribute of my late-girlfriend onto fb who died during the 9/11 attacks?. i lost my late-girlfriend on 9/11 when twc towers collapsed (she was on the 67th floor). i had no calls or texts from her, all i hope is that her last moments were painless and fearless. this year i suffered a near-death accident. after it, i did a lot of looking back on my life...and having lost family and friends in tragic ways i decided to stop taking things for granted and began cherishing the people i am close with. 

so for this year, i posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my fb. it was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). i wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""i'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who i am. i hope you are proud of me.""

a few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. she asked if i  loved her or if i wanted to get a divorce. she told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my fb. of course i love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so i felt guilty and took down the post. was i out of line here? i genuinely didn't mean to hurt my wife, i just wanted people to know what a great person my late-gf was.",3

"(nyc) i am being harassed by the orthodox jewish ""police"" in my home. this has been going on for almost 2 years since i moved in. i am at my wits end, what can i do to stop it?. **edit2: putting this here since this is locked. thank everyone for all the advice/support. i will be following some of the advice recieved and update once i have one. if this works i'll be able to stay though an overwhelming amount of what i've been told leads to me accepting that there is a 60% chance i'll have no choice but to move. thanks expecially to all the  orthodox people who have reached out with practical advice and information about this group and how it works. that has been expecially helpful because it's put my situation into perspective. yeah it sucks but worst case i can move across down the block or something  and be rid of it which isn't the case for people within the community. and even though the nypd has been helpless from my perspective, they have always responded to my calls and made the group stop in that moment, which again, is not an option for people within the community. hearing from people on the other end has really helped accept the situation i've found myself in for what it is. will update when i can.**


*edit: since i am geting this a lot, to clarify: my building has cameras. the police have seen the footage. the police have responded to them harassing me and are fully aware of what is going on.  it hasn't helped. most of the time (today included) i have to call the nypd in order to get them to move and stop preventing my guests from coming in the building or to stop harassing me in that moment. they come, tell them to stop, then leave and they just do it again. today the nypd came to my home seven times. and this is common.*

i live in brooklyn ny. i purchased a condo about 2 years ago in a building where a good chunk of the apartments are rented out by orthodox families. i would say that 45% of the building is occupied by orthodox families renting and the rest are condos owned + occupied by non orthodox people. i honestly did not care and did not think this would be a problem.

since i moved in though, this has been a huge issue. i don't want to go into to much detail since it would just lead to a rant but the families in by building do not like/agree with my ""lifestyle"" and have been trying to make me uncomfortable enough to force me to move out. i honestly don't give two shits about their opinions and typically try my best to ignore them. the issue is that they have been using the jewish police to harass me. 
to give you an idea of the shit i am dealing with i'll tell you what prompted this post.  i chose to have a superbowl viewing party today. about 30 minutes into the start of the party (when there were five people here) i get a knock at my door and standing there are two fake police who try to tell me they got a 'noise complaint' and a complaint that we are using 'illicit substances' that i have to end my party. we were in my yard at this point literately just talking and smoking (cigs). my condo is on the ground floor and people who live above me can see directly into the yard so i am assuming they are who claimed the cigs were drugs.   since then, they have been standing outside of my building trying to prevent people i invited from entering and have been harassing my guess, treating to ticket them and demanding to search them. i don't want to make this post too long but this is the smallest of the shit that i have had to deal with from these fake police over the last two years. 

i am fucking done. i want this to stop. i have tried everything i can think of and dont know what else to do. i have tried calling the nypd every time they show up. this has not worked. i have complained to my condo association. no help. i have contacted my elected officials, filed complaints with the city and state, contacted the fair housing justice center to file a discrimination complaint, and nothing has worked. i keep being told that what they are doing is not illegal and that they have permission to impersonate (my word) the police and attempt to enforce (their version) of the law. 

at one point, i was gone for a week and my boyfriend was harassed for 'trespassing' for going into the home that i own with my permission. 

im sorry that this is such a long run on rant. i am just so fed up with this bullshit. i am being discriminated against and harrassed by fake police who are trying to bully me into moving out of a home i own on behalf of a bunch of people who dont even pay market rent to live in my building because they cant stand to live with a gay person and everyone is telling me this is legal.

"for propositioning a girl in the gym?. please hear me out before you judge because while i did say what you're thinking i didn't say it in the way you're thinking.

the gym i go to is very small. not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. this means working out fairly close to people even if you don't mean to. yesterday i (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (one would do a set while the other waited beside them) the girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend ""ugh i hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.""

i shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. i was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so i'm not entirely sure if it's an actual well known exercise) 

the same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf ""look there she goes again, and her forms terrible."" which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

at this point i call her out. i said ""oi, you."" she immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. so i called her out again specifically ""you in the purple top."" 

she turned round and asked what i wanted. the following conversation happens:

me; do you want to fuck me?
her: what?!
me: i said do you want to fuck me?
her: what the fuck is wrong with you?
me: well you keep staring at me, so i'm assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

she went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. i carried on with my workout and didn't see them again.

when i told my friend what happened, he said i acted like a dick and that as a woman i should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. he also pointed out that i embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

my defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn't talk shit if she doesn't want called out on it.

i moved, passed all the tests, and got licensed in october. i was put on the schedule for only 16 hours each week. the schedule is for several weeks ahead. i brought it to the attention of our scheduler and the district leader. i was told that i might get more hours at some point if i learn to work more efficiently.

i pointed out that my offer letter says full time work. he says the term isn't legally defined and it can be whatever the company defines as full time. he also said that the offer letter was void because i didn't get licensed within 90 days. he said that if i work with more urgency and get my speed-based metrics up, then everything will be just fine for me.

is he correct about all this? i went on the company website and they define full time as 30+ hours in order to get health benefits.

 i don't know a lot about the law, but it feels like it would be illegal to lure people with an offer letter that they know has requirements that are impossible. the board of pharmacy has lots of documents available online which show that a 90 day requirement is impossible to meet.

"by changing a client's desktop background to sexy pikachu. this just happened 2 hours ago.


i work for an it company that services many small/medium businesses. i'm in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. we like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.


i had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his pc unlocked. i sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. i quickly pulled up ie and googled ""sexy pikachu"". found the one(http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. then i went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. standard stuff.


i quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. he notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. then he says, ""hey, i'm remoted into a client's computer. you changed their background, not mine.""


i shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, ""hey, i have jane doe on the phone. she says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it."" jane doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. i also believe she's the owner's daughter. at first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he's not. he's just basking in the moment of instant karma. 


i stand there for a good 30 seconds before i say ""ok, send her over to me."" i'm a director and i have a working relationship with jane doe, so it's really best i talk to her.


i answer the phone. i listen to what she has to say. she had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. she attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new pc and she wants to know what's going on. i tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. i apologize for it, i tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won't happen again. thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. i hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  i've spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like ""hey, i'm locking my computer for you"" or ""hey, i'm remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?""

"for leaving/ghosting my gf that was financially dependent on me without warning after discovering she cheated on me. **update:** 

i was not expecting to post an update so soon, but i was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.

over the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. however i had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. however of course they know that i can't avoid work. so they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as i get home from work. with them is my girlfriend. they insist i talk to my girlfriend and i eventually relent and our parents leave.

once inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.

...and then she gives the most ridiculous excuse i've ever heard. she says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. this emotional support quickly turned physical

this makes no sense. we have always talked about having kids excitedly.

she takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. she also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if i don't believe her. so she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. she says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. i ask to see her phone. she reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since i threw her out.

i tell her i need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. once outside i lock the doors, unblock her on whatsapp, and send her a long text. i'm reciting this by memory so i don't have to open whatsapp and see her reply.

>whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. but you should know the following. first, if the child is mine, i will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. we will never get back together. the moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. secondly, i will not interact with you at all until the child is born. don't reach out to me until then, i want nothing to do with you. finally, i will not have any role in the kid's life - nor will i sign any birth certificate - until i get a paternity test. this child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. i will never forgive you for that.

i have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. i also won't post any updates after this. i get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so i'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.

**with regards to the meta post:** i know i'm not an asshole for leaving her. i'm more concerned with the way i went about it.

-------------------------

my gf and i have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. she quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.

last week i discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-bf from high-school. i needed to use her phone to call mine, and went i unlocked her phone it was open on a whatsapp conversation between them. i have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and i don't understand why she'd want to be with him.

anyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. angry that i've put so much into this relationship and woman that i thought would be the mother of my future children. angry that i've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. just angry.

so i arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as i can find, and leave it outside. text her of what i've done, and say if she wants to get anything else i've missed to have her brother come and get it - i don't want to see or speak to her ever again.

anyway, since i did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. they say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if i kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.

what do you guys think? am i the asshole here? should i swallow my pride and approach this differently?

**edit2: the lease is also only in my name and she's never paid a dime of rent in the entire time she's been living here.**",3

"by leaving a dildo on the table and ruining my sons life. this happened saturday night into sunday morning but my shame has subsided enough for me to write this out. also no throwaway because whatever. 

we have a 12 yr old son. 

saturday night after he went to bed, husband and i decided to get a little sex in. after quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the ""toy"" box. husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (he was putting new batteries in them, etc). he comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. we wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says ""what is that on the table?!""
...i immediately realized the fu. husband did not so he asks ""what is it?"" 
son: a purple banana (ps he's 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
cue immediate shame/laughter. i wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

side note. we did not use that particular ""purple banana"" that night-thank god. 

after we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says ""what do you want for breakfast?"" 
son says ""i lost my appetite"" 

i'm still dying inside. i'm sure son is too.

tl;dr left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won't ever be the same.

edit: ok guys-you realize it's 2019, the internet is alive and well, and 7th grade 12yr old boys are exploring etc right?! it's not crazy that he knows what dildos are.

also edit: i didn't treat it like it was shameful and i know i didn't actually ruin his life. but no one wants to think of their parents having sex. we laughed about it afterwards and made purple banana jokes the rest of the day. we are open and communicate etc. i was mortified and still am, because it's embarrassing.",4
"update ga just moved into a condo, neighbor is raising hell over my nonexistent pet bird.  original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8chp37/ga_just_moved_into_a_condo_neighbor_is_tasing/)

tl;dr of previous post\- my next door neighbor is absolutely convinced i have a pet bird and has made complaints to the hoa, animal control, and the police because my supposed pet bird is so loud it is causing emotional distress.

i got another complaint from the head guy running the hoa that my \(now multiple\) birds are causing severe emotional distress to my neighbors and their children, who can't sleep at night because of my ""flock"" of birds. the wife sent a recording to him as proof of my bird\(s\), and to tell him to tell me my smoke alarm is also beeping and needs the batteries replaced because they can hear it from their unit as well. 

now, you can clearly hear a smoke alarm beeping, as well as birds chirping on the recording. however, the beeping is coming from their unit, as i can faintly hear it if i press my ear to the shared wall. and the birds that are supposedly my pets? the ones that are so loud that their whole household can't sleep and it's causing severe emotional distress? those are the birds outside. it's literally the chirping of the birds outside they're hearing. now, i'm no disney princess, so i have no effect on wild birds\- or imaginary pet birds\- for that matter. i mean, my singing is so terrible it actually scares them away.  and i'm not sure how any person that is not a complete moron would mistake ordinary bird chirping for ""a flock of loud, abused rain forest birds"".

i've sent a letter to the hoa telling them to kindly pound sand and stop harassing me over the wild birds that i have no control over. i'm also going to record the birds from my porch and from inside the condo so if they say i have birds again i can prove that it's just ordinary outside birds making reasonable outside bird noises.  i'm looking into get a bird feeder as well, because it's allowed by the hoa covenants and fuck these people for being utter imbeciles and blaming me for the natural behaviour of wild animals. 

now i'm just going to sit and wait for the next problem they have with me,  because i don't think these nitwits will take kindly to being proven wrong over something so stupid.",2
"aita for wearing the ""joke"" bikini my friend got me?. so it was my birthday couple months ago. had a party. got some gifts. my friend ""mandy"" for me a ""super cute bikini"". i liked it. said thanks. she had ripped the tags off but whatever. 

anyway. went to the community pool with my roommate. wore bikini. got in the water. roommate immediately is like uhm girl.... i look and see that this bikini is now kinda see thru. 

haha good joke mandy. 

anyway, mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. most leave and we're still hanging out. i'm like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? i go change after them. and meet her bf in the hot tub she's getting new drinks. i hop in. immediately, he's looking at my chest. i pretend i don't notice and just make small talk. she comes out a few min after. and just looks in shock. eventually gets in. ""uhh is that the one i bought?"" yeah i love it. i wear it everywhere. make up some stuff about how i wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she's just like ""oh"". 

we're in the tub for 20-30. eventually get out and change. she approached me after and was like. ""uhm i'm sorry thought you'd notice. but it goes kinda see thru"". i'm like yeah i know why'd you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? ""she's like it's a joke. wait you knew? so you just spent last 30' flashing my bf on purpose?"" i reply i'm just wearing my birthday gift from her.

"tifu by accidentally revealing to my whole family that i masturbate every morning. 
this happened a couple hours ago and they're still laughing


i was visiting my parents house for dinner with my family, and almost everyone in my family *of 7*  got apple watches recently and was talking about fitness tracking and heart rate monitoring *they're all health nuts* and we got to the topic of resting heart rates and sleeping patterns and i was looking at my sleep monitoring and realized that my heart rate aggressively spikes every morning when i wake up so i brought it up with them and everyone was trying to think of what i could possibly be doing in the morning that causes my heart rate spike to an active heart rate so quickly. my sister and mom realized at the same time and started dying laughing until i realized what the first thing i do in the morning...

tl:dr family looked at my heart rate patterns and figured out i masturbate every morning.

"(update) the exceptionally stupid ending to the cat scam saga-cat now has a no contact order. you all thought it over.  so did i.  but no!  turns out this story really could get weirder

recap- years ago i took in an injured stray cat.  the cat was did not have a collar or chip.  a good faith attempt was made to locate possible owners. after owning the cat for several years i began receiving messages on social media from someone claiming to be the original owner.  they demanded i return the cat and i refused and blocked them.  eventually they escalated to sending letters to my home on letterhead from a nonexistent lawyer's office.  the letters demanded i pay hundreds for the privilege of keeping the cat or they would sue (for what exactly was unspecified.)  at this point it was clear this was a scam, albeit a bizarre one.

someone on the bola thread suggested reporting the letters to the local bar association. i ignored the first two but when they kept arriving i went ahead and did so.  i assume the bar association took some kind of action because the next letter i received was basically the scammer raging 'how dare you'.  this was the first letter that contained an actual threat against my safety.

so, to cut this already way too long story short, i filed a police report.  after some additional letters my cat now has a no contact order.  okay, okay, it's in my name, but we all know it's really for the cat.  

i will say the threats were of the more creative, less actionable sort, but i'm hopeful this will truly put an end to it.  this is honestly the single dumbest thing i've ever gone through.

my cat continues not to care.

"a pigeon just laid an egg on my fucking bed and is always coming inside my room.. so really quick background on this, i live in my apartment in an 11th-floor room and hence we have rooms with a small balcony on the corner. so there are this two pigeons (a couple i assume) and they are always sneaking into my room and then sits on the bed. i thought they were like dumb and would scatter them away. so some days later, i found a twig in my bed. and then is when i realized that these birds want to fucking make a nest in my bed. so i then threw away the stick and shut the windows and the balcony to restrict them.

so things were kinda okay but then after coming home, i found that i forgot to close the windows and one of them came inside and is comfortably sitting on my bed. and also my bed was like full of clothes, 'cause i was too lazy to sort them out. i scared the pigeon away, but then i found an egg in my bed. it fucking laid an egg. why are these birds so dumbasses? man, also i live in an area with nature and trees around it and out of all those wonderful places, you had to pick my bed. i didn't throw the egg away or anything, that was morally wrong as i thought.  so i put out a pan with a rag on top of it and the placed the egg on it and kept it in the balcony.  but the bird is not coming to it and is again trying to sneak in the room. i placed the egg literally next to their sight and still, the mama bird ain't even sitting on top of it? so what am i gonna do? will the egg not hatch if this goes on?

so is there any problem that if i touch the egg, the birb won't accept it or shit?

&#x200b;

edit; these things happened in a span of three weeks btw, so it first came to my room in the first week, i found a twig during the second week, and the egg in the end of the third week (just yesterday)

***edit*** \#4: idk if anyone is here, but the bird laid two eggs as expected. so when i found the bird and the egg on my bed, i think it was gonna lay another egg but i scattered it away. and quick facts on pigeons on the way;

* sometimes the mama and the papa bird may share the time sitting on the eggs
* most often they egg two eggs, but not simultaneously (yeah i thought they laid two at the same time)
* and as u/kelekona said, they mostly nest in cliffs most often, so i'm guessing the apartment looked like a cliff to it? man these birbs",7

"tifu by selling my nudes to my stepdad. obligatory notice that this happened a couple of days ago, but i'm still recovering from it.



let me introduce myself real quick.
i'm an ethot who sell nudes and feet pics. been doing this for almost 6 months now , cuz life is hard and i need money. i've been reaaally discreet about it tho. my family is too traditional for a closet bisexual hoe like me, and if they were to find out, my head would be on a platter n i knew it. so me, the sneaky know it all i thought myself to be, continued selling nudes n living my best life until the major fuck up  happened.


2 months a ago, an elderly man dm'ed me on twitter  asking to be his sugar babe. knowing the scammers that lurk around, i didn't give much attention to that. his profile was new n anon with a few tweets and no face (has body pics tho) , so my suspicion grew. also, i'm not open about my ethotness on my twitter handle so when he dm'ed out of the blue it felt weird.

but this man was persistent. he dm'ed again after a couple of days, saying that he has noticed the paypigs that follow me and kinda know that i'm an ethot, and if i wasn't one he's sorry. i ignored again. but i was intrigued by this older man who has a decent tl so being the bitch i'm, i started stalking to know if he's legit or not. his page contained mostly political tweets and there was actual people interacting with him. my curiosity grew so i thought it'd be a good idea to text him back- and that's when it all started.


we both kept our anonymity and started having little chats. what started out as  sweet chats transitioned to mad dirty as days went by. he was extremely sweet n sincere . he bought a few of my nudes and then we started trading pics. every night he sent me vids of him jerking off , n i sent him mine. we literally fucked each other virtually. he told he was 45 but his abs said 30 and i was excited to get his dms every night. 18 y/o me somehow felt more valuable cuz  older man with a hot body found my itty bitty titties attractive. it went on like that for a month.

a week ago i got really horny at night n texted him . it was really late but he replied saying his wife is sleeping next to him, and can't sext. i , being the obnoxious dumb doodle i am, somehow thought it'd be a good idea for him to go to the bathroom n film . he did as i said .

i opened the video with the intention of masturbating, but boy, i was in for a surprise.

i noticed the tiles on the wall behind him. at first ,i felt numb , then a shockwave went through my entire freaking body. i recognize the tub. the tiles.the fuckin blue tiles. the same tub i used to bathe. holy fucking shit. that used to be my fuckin room.

my mind went to dumb bitch mode for a while. i sat in my room clueless . tf just happened? did i trip? was that my room? or is my mind making up shit now? the doubt kept me sleepless thru the night. you know the feeling u get when it's your finals next day n you haven't learnt shit? that feeling.

but i wasn't gonna let the doubt kill me.so,to make sure (that i was wrong), the next day i asked him to give me a mirror selfie in his bathroom. and boy, was i right. he's in what used to be my bathroom. the bathroom that i first fucked in. jesus.

i blocked him right away and sat down to process all the mess that happened. i physically revolted. i felt this thing where something goes glsbsks down your chest n abdomen. i virtually fucked my step dad. tf is my life. i don't know what made me feel so disgusted, whether the fact that we used to sext or him cheating on my mom. i felt like telling my mom that he ain't what she thinks he is, but how will i ? we weren't as close as we used to be. ever since she married him i kinda kept a distance. may be that's y i never realized that it was my stepdad. i've only met him in person just twice. also, what evidence would i provide? i felt so disturbed, nauseated and obviously , emotionally scarred. how on earth will i ever face this man again?   pretty sure he's wondering where i  dipped to. and kinda worried to invite them over to my place cuz he know my damn curtains and walls.


tl;dr : sold nudes to stepdad and made him jerk off to me, and now  anxiety and embarrassment are strangling my fucking conscience.


edit: since this blew up i think i should link the dm. it's literally 7:30 here n i haven't slept for over 24 hours so let me get some sleep first. i'll be back. be ready for some laughs at my expense.

"a 'dislike' button on facebook would actually significantly change the world...for the better. the title of this post might seem extreme on the surface, but i do believe this to be true. the absence of a dislike button on facebook warps public opinions on some serious matters, and i believe it also influences peoples own opinions.   


the only way to counter a comment you don't agree with or are offended by is to put an angry emoji or comment. the angry emoji is misleading and is often used to demonstrate your dislike of the subject at hand and not the comment itself. commenting just opens up arguments, abuse and takes time. giving people a 'dislike' option, very much like the down vote system on here would change this...  


imagine being a generally ignorant, racist, bigoted idiot and commenting something obscene online? you might post a comment that really offends 18,000 out of 20,000 people, but it shows 2k likes by like minded idiots. this sends out the wrong message. this tells people who are just passing that the opinion is popular, there is a lack of balance without the effort of commenting and getting involved in a spat. add the dislike function and suddenly the comment has 2k likes but 18k dislikes, which tells people that this is an unpopular view point and might make people think twice about what they say, or take a rain check on their attitudes.  


it would give people the freedom to disagree without engaging, it would add balance to the site, and considering how much political debate there is on there at the moment, i think it is important.  


yes i know its a social media site, but we have to take it seriously now. it influences people, some people live on there. facebook impacts the world.

"for taking back the birthday gift i gave my sister?. so, i'm 24m. my little sister is 14 and has always been interested in art. i moved an hour and a half away when i was 18 and we 
don't see eachother often, but i make a point to call/text


it was her birthday yesterday and i thought i'd splurge since she's been going through a rough time. she's changed schools twice due to bullying and our mom always tells me that she won't talk to anyone, is having intense mood swings, etc. i've made multiple attempts to help her, but she shuts me down and gets snippy.



anyway, i got her a set of 150$ artist grade markers called copics. i'm no art connoisseur, but apparently every artist who's anybody has them and our parents don't wanna spend that kind of money for her hobby (they're about 5$ per marker) and tend to give practical gifts like clothes. whenever we've texted recently it's been her ranting about them not getting them for her.

even on her birthday she was like a bomb about to go off. she barely acknowledged me and only said hello when she was asked. i was excited to give her the gift but the second i opened it she grabbed them and turned to our mom, saying ""see! even he knows you should've got them for me!"" which i awkwardly brushed off. everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like ""oh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite."" ""a plaid skirt. wow. i'm blessed."" 


i was prepared for an angsty teen, but i soon reached my limit. our dad showed her a journal they bought and she suddenly yelled ""i told you both exactly what i wanted but you spent the same amount of money on shit i don't need! fuck this!"" she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.



our parents were a lot less well-off when i was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me. everytime it was a dodgy cake and a handful of clothes without holes in them, i accepted them like i was the luckiest kid ever. i would've never swore and yelled but she's been very spoiled.


i talked with them for awhile and apparently shes done worse before which shocks me. they think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. i agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?


sister came back to get the markers, but i took them back. i said that she was ungrateful and i wouldn't tolerate it. she started screaming at me but i just left the ""party"" prematurely with the gift in tow.



my whole family is blowing up my phone because i ""ruined her birthday"". in my eyes, i spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. this will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase. but my family doesn't want to hear from me until i give it back. considering i've got my entire family shitting on me, i have to wonder if i did make the wrong choice. so, reddit, aita?",3

"for telling my mom she's a whore?. throwaway. long time lurker, first time posting. 

i am the oldest daughter of 4 children. i'm currently 25, 2nd oldest is 23, 3rd is 20, and youngest is 18. 

when i was 8 years old, my mom had an affair with a family friend. i, being the oldest has remembered most of it and my younger siblings only remember growing up with our parents co parenting. 

this has put a strain on my mothers and i's relationship- she cheated on my father who was battling cancer. 
she didn't even try to keep it a secret from the kids, i remember during family/friend gatherings when everyone would be inside and i'd see my mom and the family friend kissing or doing things in the pool. as a kid i didn't understand, but as i got older i realized what she was doing in front of us and i feel sick. 

people ended up catching on to their affair years later, and my mom left my dad and started a new relationship with this ""family friend"". they split up shortly after that because he cheated on my mother. 

i've confronted her about this after my dad passed and we all went to see a family therapist. this was roughly 3 years ago. 

my mom has since remarried to an incredible man, but recently she was out and bumped in to this man from her past. they exchanged emails and she confided in me that they have been sending emails back and forth and are planning to meet up to chat and catch up. i read the messages and it's very apparent that the guy still has feelings, while my mom is trying to make it seem like she's just catching up with an old co worker. but i know my mother, and i know she is still slightly infatuated with this man, and flattered that he still wants her. i mean it's been years, why else would you want to catch up?

my new step dad knows about her past, and while he doesn't agree with it, it's been years, he wasn't in her life yet.

she asked me what i thought about her meeting up with him, and said something along the lines of needing closure. she asked for my honest opinion about the matter and i told her; 

""to be honest mom, you dealing with this guy in the past ruined yours and daddy's marriage and you guys had 4 kids. idk why you think it wouldn't ruin this one, but why don't you stop being a whore and stop thinking with your pussy, and delete this guys damn email?""

she cried, said she couldn't believe i just called her a whore and left my house. we haven't spoken for a few days.

today, i got a call from my siblings saying i hurt my moms feelings and whatever happened betweens her and daddy's marriage was between them. i disagree, i had to witness my mom cheating on my father, i watched him die in bed while she was off to god knows where with this man. she asked for my opinion and my opinion is that she's selfish and a whore who left my dad to die on his own and she wants to rekindle with this man and possibly cheat on my new step dad? sorry i'm not sorry for feeling some type of way about it.",3

"neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. for the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

at first i just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. however after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

i've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

she will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. i've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. i don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

when she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when i'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. before i started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. now since i've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. somehow this is my fault.

now i'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred german shepard, an english bulldog and a mix sheppard/bulldog).

i just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. i have a pool and if she falls in when i'm not home she could very well drown. that's why i installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, i truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

i've called the local child and family services office (cps) several times in the past two months to report it because i feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. i have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that i've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when i open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

i feel like i've done everything i can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. i just have no idea what to do now? i've debated calling the police when she enters but i don't know how that will escalate.",2

"i said no to my gf's proposal.. warning: this is a long one. scroll down to the tl;dr if you don't want the full story. 

yeah... i f***ed up today. see, i've been dating my gf (k) for 5 years. we are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. i've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. the reason i haven't is that about 2 years ago, i got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

it's been very rough on the two of us, but k has stuck with  me every step of the way. my disease, gpa, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. i'm starting drugs that haven't been fda approved for my condition. all other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. this new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. i'm terrified to say the least. all of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

i want to be healthy and stable before i even think about marriage. i don't want to leave k as a widow with no support! k & i had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that i needed to go into remission first. we agreed to it, or so i thought. flash foreword to a few hours ago and k is with my family in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

i saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. i immediately started freaking out. first thought: i haven't even gone into remission yet and i have no clue if i'm going to get better. i cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. what if i die from all of this? second thought: goddamn it dad! why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

i guess i'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my dad was a very involved parent when i was young. when i entered high-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. the expectations would get so high that i couldn't live up to them. similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. both my brothers and i find this to be a real problem, if my dad is left unchecked. i would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. back to the story!

anyway, i'm freaking out. i just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" with my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, i ran out of the building... i made the love of my life cry as i selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. i've never felt so ashamed in my life... after calming down, i talked to my mother, and drove back to talk to k.

in the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. tears were shed and things were said. k told me i was being selfish. ""we've been dating for years, who cares if you die, i want to marry you!"" she also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. she understood why i would be paranoid about my dad though. k understands that my dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

in the end, we reconciled. we made up, decided that i was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. we came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. we want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

now i'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if i do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, i'll be with my best friend/lover. k is my world, and i'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

thanks for listening.

i said no when my gf proposed bc i'm on chemo and don't know if i'm gonna go into remission or die. decided i was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.

"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) found an engagement ring i was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. she thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.. i've been dating my girlfriend laura for just over two years. we met as i was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. we have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and i love her a great deal. she's definitely been the healthiest relationship i've ever had and i see a strong future with her. 

this weekend has been awful, however. my best friend rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend grace of about seven years. the problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. i offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. i hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last monday when he asked for it back. he (successfully!) proposed to grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

literally five minutes after she posted, laura rang me absolutely fuming. she told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had i given it to rob for grace when i'd clearly chosen it especially for her? was grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? i tried to talk her down and explain that i'd just been keeping it safe for rob and that i'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that i'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. she hung up on me, then texted me that i had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

am i wrong for thinking this is a red flag? i know that she probably was really excited and i absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. we don't live together and i don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. more than that, i am 100% not ready for marriage. we've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. i want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

what do i do? i totally understand why she'd be upset but i just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that i'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. this is the first big fight we've had and i'm not sure if i'm just seeing red flags because i'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

tl;dr: girlfriend snooped and found a ring that i was keeping safe for a friend. she's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by valentine's day or the relationship's off. need help determining what my next move should be.",8
"for refusing to use the money i inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? she is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.. when i was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. in one split second, the happy family i knew was gone, and i went through the darkest time in my life.

my parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). she never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship i wanted to have with him. i eventually forgave my dad mostly because i was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. i talk to him but i want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

my mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which i now own and operate. i am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. he was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

this year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. the bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

the thing is, i don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when i think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and i have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. i'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. they are her parents after all. the only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""she is your sister"" and ""if she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""

"update to: i found out i have a daughter who thinks i was her mother's rapist. it wasn't rape. what next?. ten days ago i requested advice and the post got removed after a day because i didn't use a throwra.  i'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. i alerted the moderators i would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

original

i received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a dna match and she is my biological daughter. it was a long and emotionally charged letter. she said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish i had caused her and her mother and grandparents. the letter was gut wrenching.

i was shocked but also skeptical. i have been married 25 years and i have three great kids. i have never raped or abused a woman ever! i thought this had to be a prank or scam. i had done home dna ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child i wasn't aware of. but when i logged into my account, there she was.

i did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, terry (fake name), i had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  we broke it off mutually and remained friendly. the very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. it was a casual hookup and i remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. also unprotected. afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. we both went home the next morning for summer break. terry didn't come back to college the next year, which i gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

one of the reasons terry and i were incompatible was religion. she was catholic and i'm jewish. i was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. my supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a jewish ex-boyfriend. but who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

it kills me that i have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. i can't imagine growing up thinking i was a product of rape. that has to be so hard psychologically. i am in pain for a child i didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

i have been debating what to do. i have not written back to my daughter. i badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). my wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. my best friend says i should hire a lawyer. i don't know what to do and it's eating me up. advice, please!

update

i hired a lawyer. he recommended that i respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. i wrote her a short message and described how and when terry and i met. i was careful not to attack terry and to offer sympathy. i explained that our sex was consensual. a week went by with no response.

two days ago my daughter wrote me and said terry now claims she was raped a month after she and i had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. she's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. i find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not i guess it gives terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

yesterday i spoke to my daughter for the first time. she was crying and so was i, so it wasn't easy to say much. before we hung up, i told her that i loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and i hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. she sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

my wife and i told our kids about a week ago. they are teenagers and took it really well. all three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. my wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. she has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. my daughter is going to call me again tonight and i'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. we have a lifetime of catching up to do.

meantime as for terry, i feel like my daughter and i were robbed, but i really don't want to dwell on it. she hasn't reached out to me and i don't plan to either, though i'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.

flash forward to yesterday, when i was looking through my old junk. i was bored and decided to do some (late) spring cleaning, when i came upon the box. i smirked and opened up the box to see my prized possession, the fleshlight. i put it aside for today, when i decided to use it. out of lube, i went it dry, fuck up #1. once i reached as far in as my lil member would let me in it, i felt a tickling sensation. uneased i pulled out fast, giving my dick a rug burn type sensation. to my surprise, and disgust, i was met with a spider on the tip of my dick. without thinking, i instantly flicked it off with my long ass fingernails, scraping the tip of my dick. in pain, i freaked out and let the spider get away.

throwaway for obvious reasons. i'm still shook and my boyfriend and i have been freaking out since we found out. i'm at the end of my rope and don't know what to do.

our daughter is 11 years old. we found out she was pregnant. she had always been close with a boy from our neighborhood, he's 13. we never thought anything of it as we'd known him and his family for several years since we moved here.

it was clear she had a crush on him, but i never thought anything of it. until she started complaining about things, i'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when i had been pregnant. 

i didn't jump to the conclusion, but i did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

they'd been having sex. god knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. i won't go in to details. because i never wanted to imagine them myself. 

we had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. my boyfriend was fuming after i told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

they knew as much as we did of the whole thing. they were as shocked as we were. we've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

but she keeps saying she wants a baby. and i just don't fucking know what to do. i tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  i was trying to be level headed. but she didn't seem to understand at all. we've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

what can i do? is the boy, or his parents liable? what can a doctor do? can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?

for the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. it is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

for the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a greek tragedy, i apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

now to start where things left off.

after making my original post, i combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a plan b box and thrown it into the garbage. a lot of them made sense. my greatest hope was that it might have just been old. maybe it was before we even met. clinging to that, i hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. i'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what i would say in response, and what i would do. i memorized them all.

on the evening after i made my original post, i called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. as i had practiced, i asked her the following question:

>hey, i'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up plan b box in the garbage? 

the second the words ""plan b"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. she was completely lost for words. i already knew at that point. i retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>why was there a torn up plan b box in the garbage? you know i had a vasectomy. 

she just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. then she looked to the floor. then she started weakly sobbing. 

this was not on the flowchart. i had no idea how to respond. i thought if i let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. finally i prompted her with another question:

>are you crying because you did something you regret?

she shook her head violently. i was so concerned because i thought something horrendous might have happened.

she abruptly shrieked ""i'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" i have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

so i prompted her again. 

>just tell me why it was there. you don't have to hide anything from me.

she yelled at me again. repeatedly. ""if you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""fuck you for not trusting me.""

this line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. i refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, i wasn't budging an inch. she then informed me that either i had to leave or she would leave. since i doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), i agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. i went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

the following night, i texted her asking if she was ready to talk. she was not. instead, she gave me an ultimatum: i had to 1 apologize, 2 promise to never bring it up again, and 3 learn to trust her completely. only then would she allow me back home. if i couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

i have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. i am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. i currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. the lawyer will probably tell me i'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

there is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. i am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. none of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. i'm holding off on saying anything until i'm calm and rational and won't do something i'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, i feel awful about it. ",8

"update: my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now he's being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place nsfw. link to original(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cxr0sp/my_childhood_friend_went_through_my_boyfriends/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

#that ""half blurred nude"" everyone's talking about is rick astley. please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#the other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. please read the post before commenting.

so a couple things have happened in the last few days, and i figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

first, i'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. he is just as much a victim of a crime as i am, if not more. this has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. he is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

it's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

i spoke to a lawyer...and my dad. the lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **if** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

anyways. monday, i got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. the first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". she would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

in my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. it also matters that there are two victims.

the police spoke to the people whose names i provided, most of which confirmed that sarah had shared the photos. they'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

that all made both me and john happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(all of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

so i turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. i spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. then i paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""under construction"". then i registered john and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""content pending copyrights"".

then. i posted on facebook.

""recently, someone i consider a friend broke into john's phone and stole images. she then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

not only am i disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed john in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. this person did not come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

had i actually been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. how horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

in actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

most of you know me as an entrepreneur; i own a small business, i pick up freelance jobs, i dabble in several money making ventures. none of this is a consistent income, so john and i have been brainstorming on how i could possibly generate a passive income. 

so we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. we had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and john's name was dragged through the dirt.

shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

because of this person and all who participated, i have had to out john and myself as sex workers. i've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn dad. shame on all of you.

from this point on, any person sharing these copyrighted images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

if anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

thank you.""

since then, i've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on facebook.

sarah tried to call but i hit ignore and texted her, ""you may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. she hasn't responded.

all in all, i'd say that things are looking up. sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. john's name is clear legally. important people in my life know that i'm not being abused. 

people are reaching out to john to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

so that's good, i guess.

i want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

edit: to everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

i submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. i wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

i was, an still am, angry. so i got shit done.

*edit edit*: **i am not releasing the videos.**

**another edit**: since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, this is where i got my information(https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#final edit:

this is getting out of hand so i'll be logging off. people asked for an update, so they got it.

copied from a comment i posted:

nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting sarah arrested.

my lawyer told me that, no, john could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, i could go ahead and post on facebook to try to control the narrative. 

he *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. as of now, i've achieved everything i wished to do. the police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

i don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",8
"tifu by having a threesome. my girlfriend and i have been together for several months now. we only see each other on weekends due to distance and work schedules, but this last weekend i fucked up. 

her friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. they were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and i was involved. we went to the bed and started fucking, but before i went inside her friend, i looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, ""is this okay?"" 

she said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. after a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn't find her for 15 min. 

my girlfriend was understanding and wasn't upset with me, or her friend, or so i thought. i called her the following night cause i felt extremely guilty. she said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. she simply asked that i never do it again. 

come this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends. i absolutely love her so much but i let lust get between us. 

i really fucked up guys..

tl;dr: i fucked my girlfriend's friend with her and then she broke up with me because she doesn't want to be with someone who slept with her friends.",4

"by making myself an uncle nsfw. so this started 2 weeks ago

i went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a gf.

 naturally i start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. i get to teasing him about him not losing his v card, my mom is not liking the conversation. his gf ends up coming over, i stopped the teasing i'm not a monster. so i'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. i tell her not to worry about it i'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

i get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. my argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised ying and yang i grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. he grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. saying how a party would be good for him i even offered to go, (i'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, i told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (i know how that sounds). so i finally convinced her she agreed.

so i decide that i need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. i knew my bro was losing it that night. fast forward to the party, i drop him off so my mom thinks imma be there. i pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. well holy fuck did i get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  so now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and i'm becoming an uncle.

tl;dr convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his v card, he got his gf pregnant. 


update 1: so she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. so we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. i'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. my brother is getting tested for sti's i was all over him about that. also thanks for the gold and silver (i have no idea what that does). thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

update 2: everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. my brother does not have any sti's or std's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,i'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. there are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can dm and i can explain what i did if curious, how i got out, how my life has changed and all. 

update 3: *in maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! mother is crying brother is in shock and the gfs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. everyone pray for this child. 


update 4: they are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, i helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. i've started a savings account for him, and my gf and i are going to move into a place with him and his gf to help them out.",4
"for showing up at my cousin's wedding in a hoodie and jean shorts?. last fall, my husband and i went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

in the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. she was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. the wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. i thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. she didn't tell the couple tho. just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

we traveled 600 miles to the wedding. we treated the trip like a vacation. spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

the day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. i hate dressing up so i was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

my husband and i had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. a few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. i wore a hoodie, daisy duke shorts and cute sandals. 

i noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but i figured they didn't get the memo. the bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which i thought was weird for a casual wedding. the reception was awesome. nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. we had a blast. 

so we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. they thought it was very disrespectful. apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. this explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

tbh we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. and they never specified the dress code in the invitation. but i still have to ask. aita?",3
"by eating first and asking questions later.  

my fiance and i have been eating keto for the last 3 months. she recently bought these ""butter bombs"" that you put in your coffee/hot tea that adds fat to your diet. i saw half of one on the countertop and decided to give it a go because i hadn't used one yet.

i proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. i threw it in the blender and glugged it down. i thought it was weird that it didn't melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. it didn't taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.

smash cut to later in the evening when my fiance says to me as i'm watching tv, ""hey have you seen the other half of the air freshener wax that was on the countertop?"" smh. my fat ass thought it was food. i suppose i should go on amazon now and leave a review. 5 stars, would eat again.

"for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?. this is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

i live on an obscure little island near the uk. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that i appeared on a few years ago. 

the premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. i sailed through a lot of the physical part because i wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so i was ok there.

as for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

i thought of a believable lie before i entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and i put down all the things i'm *not* scared of. i listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. i literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. i grew up in rural landscape and i've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. my actual fear is a bit more obscure and i really honestly knew i'd fail if i was put in a room with it. 

when i entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* i was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross i can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

i did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. the rest of the contestants failed.

now, i won a pretty average car which i didn't particularly want, so as soon as i legally could i sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

i told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think i cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

i'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",3
"for lying to my son's girlfriend's parents?. my son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  they are both 16.  her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and i pick him up in the evening.  i will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.

the mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  it's her house.  most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  he is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .wtf?  and she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  they also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  whatever.

regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   well, today she came over for the first time.   the night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  i am a correctional officer and was working that night, so i wasn't home to take the call.  my son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   i don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  my husband agreed.

thing is, we don't really care.  i was sexually active at a younger age than them.  my son and i have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  he is a lovely boy, and i believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  they have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  anyway, not only did i not check on them constantly, i told him that as long as she was willing, i would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  my husband and i actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and i asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  good friend laughed and agreed.   turns out it wasn't needed.   dad eventually came and picked her up.

i absolutely stand by my opinion that my son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but i am kind of wondering if i should have made that choice for someone else's child.  i kind of feel guilty, but i think her parents are way over the top control freaks.

"tifu by getting a facial. this happened about two hours ago.

i've been extremely stressed as of late and my boyfriend wanted to help me relax. he flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart's delight. he even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. i really wanted to show him how i much i appreciated all his gestures, so i thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. i start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. he gives me the signal and i activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view i can. that's where the fuck up occurs. i tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. it took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time i figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. at this point, i just sit there and take it up the nose because i'll be damed if i let man gravy get on anything. i immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but i didn't get it all. not long after, i feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. i still have the smell of semen in my nose. 

tldr: a dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose.

"i build my (26m) relationship on a lie and i dont know how to tell my gf (24f) or what to do.  i met my gf on tinder and she had a picture with a dog so, of course, i commented on it as i broke the ice. we talked a bit and she turned out to love dogs and i just said that yeah, dogs are great, because she seemed sweet and cute and i wanted a date.

things progressed but we never met in her place because she had 2 roommates who acted like bunnies (if you know what i mean) so we usually would hang out at my place. i only really saw her dog when i was picking her up and i would never come in so i had no interaction with it.

thing is she moved out to her own place last week. she now wants to hang out at her place. i would be very happy but her dog will be there too and...

i am really, really afraid of dogs. i know i should've been honest from the get go but back then it seemed like such a small thing to lie about. i mean, how many tinder dates go beyond a hookup? and then the more time passed the more embarassed i felt. especially since she would say that her dog breed gets so much bad rep by ignorant people and i just... how can i tell her i'm one of those people? except i'm afraid of all dogs, not only hers so really it is worse?

how do i fix this? i don't want our relationship to end because i can't man up and just act like a normal person when i'm in a room with a friendly dog... i fucked up and i dont even know what to do here",8

about a week ago, i was running errands with my 1 and 3 year old boys. we had some time to kill, and my 3 year old said that he wanted to see his daddy. so we picked up lunch and took it to my husband's work so that he could have a hot lunch instead of leftovers from the night before.

we got the boys out of their carseats, let them sit in our laps as we all ate chicken tenders and fries in the front seat. then, my husband took us for a tour around his shop (he works in sheet metal and makes air ducts). our kids loved it!

as we were leaving, i saw my husband walking into the building and honked at him, calling out ""hey, nice butt babe!""

then it happened, my 3 year old yelled ""nice butt daddy!"" which quickly turned into ""nice butt mama.""

i tried my best to ignore it even though he kept repeating it. i thought that the worst was over when he eventually forgot about it.

i was wrong.

now, almost a week later, he is yelling out our living room window;

""nice butt papa"" (what he calls our elderly neighbor)

""nice butt mama""

""nice butt baby"" (his little brother)

i don't think we will be leaving the house today...

"you should be able to honestly tell your so if they have gained weight to the point of you losing physical attraction towards them and you shouldn't be labelled as a ""bad person / a*hole/ etc"" if you do so.. **tldr** : you should be able to straightforwardly and respectfully express to your so if they gained weight to the point you start losing desire for their body if you both consider sex  and physical attraction vital for your relationship.

**edit - before anything else please read:** 

\- so, let me start by saying i deleted most of my text as those lines don't really serve purpose. they were indeed too long to even consider reading through. 

\- the other thing is: i have to admit that this post was rushed. and yes, i am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). the funny thing is that while i might think some commenters are oversensitive i have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and i can also get oversensitive. i don't regret what i wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. some of you made the assumption that i must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. that's right. and sometimes i turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw i'm female for those who thought otherwise). the reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. i can understand that what i said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). and at the end i'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. i should have considered more factors. i want to apologize about that honestly. so thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now i'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. i'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. so thank you for offering the experience. i appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. i'll try and digest them properly in the following days. i'm still think that i'm right about some aspects but not anymore do i believe my reasoning is flawless. i wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**content:**

honesty is not kindness. honesty is honesty. period. i don't mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn't put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. you can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. if you can't take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. and yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

you can't just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ""soft"") - and how you react to that is your responsibility. the partner doesn't have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it's a sensitive topic to you. i wonder why it's so sensitive…

looks does matter. we have a right to voice what we like and by putting away our own ego we should be more flexible dealing with and communicating it.",6

"by accidentally committing theft as a police officer in full uniform.. poilce don't seem super well liked on reddit but what the hell. this happened a few weeks ago.

i woke up one morning at 5:00 a.m. tired as fuck. i put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on tv or in a video game.

i started my normal routine: got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best ""prepare for a police shift"" album of all time: ""the elder scrolls v: skyrim ost"". now for my 15 minute commute to the city.

my vehicle was getting low on gas so i stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. i went in, put my sausage, egg, and cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. then i grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like i do as the beginning of every shift. after this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.

at about noon, i get a call from my sergeant, who simply said ""i need to talk to you at the department.""

oblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, i began heading to the police department. millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. upon my arrival, i was directed to my lieutenant's office. when i walked in, i heard a stern, ""close the door"". at this point i knew this wasn't good. i sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my corporal. sergeant, and lieutenant.

after a preface from my sergeant, he says, ""tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.

i didn't say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. ""aaawww.......shit. i forgot to pay for my burrito."" then i just heard ""guess what, that's theft.""

after a ""come to jesus"" moment with my superiors, i left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. they didn't want to press charges.

although nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is i can't go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. all they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito.

"plastic bottled water in first world countries should be banned. someone made me realise today that in the west we legitimately flush our toilets with water cleaner than 90% of the world and yet we totally avoid drinking our tap water.

so many people go out and buy like bulk packages of water bottles. single use water bottles should be banned,  people should all have reusable bottles.

i mean in capital cities of australia our tap water is perfectly safe, everywhere,  even public bathrooms,  so why wouldn't you just drink it?

avoiding tap water is a first world issue,  i mean places like bali have tap water that is riddled with giardia and bulk ecoli and here we are absolutely avoiding ours when its perfectly safe (mostly,  sorry flint and parts of the usa)

"if i didn't give up my honey moon villa to my grandparents?. my family is asian, my husbands side is white.

my husband and i got married and are treating his side of the family, and my side to a 1 week all expense paid vacation to bora bora as a pre family honeymoon before going off on our ""real"" one. 
we were able to rent out half a side of the bungalows and only one villa was in that section. my husband and i took the villa.

the bungalows are a 1000 sq feet 1 bedroom(option of 1 king bed or 2 queens), 1 bathroom, and out door space type of deal. we made sure everyone was accommodated for and everyone had a comfortable living situation. 

our villa is a 4000 sq ft 1 bedroom, 1 bath including sauna, living room, a grand out door space, with an outdoor bath tub, pool and slide to get in the ocean. 

we have not even made it a whole 24 hours here yet and a fight has already broken out. during dinner, my cousin mentioned wanting to come over and use our slide. my grandparents asked what we were talking about and asked to see pictures of our room. 

well, they saw my villa and demanded that we trade rooms with them as no elders should made to ""slave"" and live as ""peasants"" while their grandchildren get a nicer room. 

this is bora bora we're talking about. no one is living as a peasant here. 

there was only 1 villa available in our section. had i given it to my grandparents i think it would've been offensive to my husbands grandparents. if there was 3, we would've given it to both grandparents and 1 for ourself. but unfortunately, there wasn't. i mentioned this and they still demanded the villa.

i obviously objected, and said i felt as though my husband and i should have that room as this is a vacation with family to celebrate our marriage, plus we paid for this entire trip? wouldn't one just sit back and be grateful they're on a free vacation instead of complaining?

my grandparents freaked out. saying i'm holding money above their head and that i'm being disrespectful and not following their orders. they stormed off after threatening to take the first flight out tomorrow morning and leaving. 

idk what to do. my side of the family is telling me to just give them the room to be respectful and bring peace to the family, while my husbands side thinks my grandparents are bat shit crazy and i agree. they are so ridiculous. all i wanted was both sides of the family to get together and get to know each other and now it's falling apart. 

i don't think i'm the asshole at all, but i've been up all night thinking wether i should just squash it and invite my grandparents to stay in my villa in order for them not to leave. but another part of me just wants to tell them to go fuck themselves for making my honey moon about themselves, just like they do with everything else. 

so reddit, what do i do? if i denied giving up my villa?



***update***
even though i really wanted to be petty and tell them to fuck off, i decided it'd be better to kill them with kindness so they have little to work with if they decide to spin it around that i was disrespectful.

during breakfast my grandparents refused to show up if i was there. everyone tried calling them-nope we're not coming cause disrespectful granddaughter is there. after a lot of persuading and even having to send our baby cousin to their room to soften them up, they finally decided to come. 

i made the first conversation by asking if they looked at any flights to leave yet, they could forward the paystub to my cell. they said they hadn't looked yet and that should be my job if i was kicking them out?? i made sure they knew i was not kicking them out, but understood if they wanted to leave and offered to send some staff to their room to pack up their belongings so they could have a little more time to explore, or get their complimentary in room massage that comes with all the bungalows. 

they kind of stopped eating and looked at each other in shock. every time they threaten not to go anywhere, my family has always babied them and begged them not to leave and offer money or extravagant gifts for them to stay. 

well, i'm not doing that. 
i'll pay for their flight back home, but i've already done enough accommodating on my honeymoon vacation. 

so there you have it. my grandparents weren't even planning to go home, they tried scaring me into begging them to stay. i called their bluff. 

after breakfast, i found a flight leaving around 5pm and walked to the main desk to ask them to cancel reservations for that room for the rest of the trip and to send staff to help pack. they also didn't get their complimentary massage because the resort only offers that on 4 night stays or longer. 

staff came to help pack, and they left half an hour ago. im currently in my villa de stressing before dinner and some uncles came in(who were married into family) and confided in me that they were sick and tired of the entitlement my grandparents have had since day 1 and they were glad someone born into the family decided to speak up. my cousins came over and honestly couldn't care less my grandparents are gone, in their words ""they kill the vibe"". so everyone's happy right now and is using my slide before cleaning up for dinner. 

i'm happy i was able to stand up to my grandparents without being blatantly disrespectful. 

i have an overflow of messages and comments, that i can't get back to. however, the main question is what my profession is. 

i did not go the usual asian route. i actually dropped out my last year of college and started a fashion line that took a couple years to take off, but surprisingly sky rocketed a few years ago. my dad is also an entrepreneur, i looked up to him and am so glad i had him as an inspiration who paved the way. don't give up on your dreams, you guys.",3

"update: if i cancelled our wedding?. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cuvkw3/wibta_if_i_cancelled_our_wedding/

tldr at the bottom! 

hello, all! it's been some time since i laid out all the bullshit my fiance and i were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. we were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. now, on to what happened! 

my fiance and i talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. we both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. we decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. we were both ecstatic, but, also extremely worried at how our parents were going to take it. especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. but, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and i would then tell mine. 

surprisingly, his parents were so supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. they were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! they also handled telling their families and friends in texas that we were eloping and to get over it. so, that saved us the trouble! his other family was very supportive and wished us the best. my father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. my mother on the hand, was furious.

the phone call to her started off calmly enough and i did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. but, i pressed forward. i told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, i laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. i knew immediately that i was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. 

less than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. i was pissed because i had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. i responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. well, shit hit the fan.

she sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how i never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. i remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. so, i told her not to come. i was over it and stopped responding to her texts. 

for days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. i responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that i wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. i offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. 

my fiance and i have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! 

tldr: we are eloping, bitches!

"if i tell my wife that i will no longer be helping with her pregnancy cravings or sleep next to her because she lashed out at me for not finding choco chip ice cream at 3am?. this happened a couple of days ago and i was really pissed. i'm here because i want to know if i'm in the wrong here. 

my wife is going to give birth to our twin daughters. i've done everything to support her. i make breakfast everyday and i make it a point to make whatever she asks me to make. 

yesterday, my wife woke me up at 2am and told me that she wanted to eat icecream. we had no ice cream left because she ate it all at night. i really wanted to get her the ice cream. she told me that she wanted choco chip. i drove for an hour to find a place at that time. but they didn't have any choco chip at that time. i didn't want to disappoint her, so i got strawberry, her next favourite flavour. 

when i got back, i told her that i didn't find choco chip. idk what happened but she started crying and yelling  at me. she threw away the ice cream, called me a fucking imbecile and told me i didn't love her. she also told me that she didn't want to sleep next to me. i slept in another room. 

now today, she comes to me, cries, apologizes and tells me that she was really stressed out. but i did not sleep with her at night. i've decided that i don't want to do anything now. this is not the first time this has happened. i'm not a fantastic cook. she insists that i make something for her, but when i make it she always tells me that it's horrible. she later apologizes and tells me that it was wonderful ( all this started after the pregnancy ). here??",3

"update: my sister (f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (f46) is pressuring me to. thanks for the great advice. so a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

my grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

i explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who stan lee was. surprisingly she understood just perfectly. i was relieved. for a moment i thought that my dad and i would get shit from everyone.
my sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". i told her that she asked me and i just told the truth.

but what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. she again ridiculed my hobby and so on. one of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. the dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. she is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

my mom and sister came back in the morning. they didn't talk much to us . my mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. we had a short dry conversation till she asked me why i was making such a big deal about it. and i shut her up like you guys told me to. i started by explain who stan lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. it's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. you said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because i didn't lend her my jacket ""

ya'll my mom cried. she apologized profusely. she said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as i was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

i told my parents that i'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in new mexico for 2 days. they never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. so in the morning i picked her up and we drove to new mexico. we took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. she spent the day and that night at my place. i called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so i'll bring her there tomorrow.

she was feeling fine by then. so nothing suspicious at all. she's very happy this worked out the way it did and i'm happy that she's happy. i told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. you can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

"by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway.. yesterday i got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. i squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. i notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where i'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. he looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. as a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

though i couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so i decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. as i sat down i thanked him for making room and told him i really appreciated the gesture. we high-fived and in hindsight i should have ended it there.

i noticed he had his backpack with him so i asked how school was that day. he told me it was just alright. then i asked the fatal question, ""do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" he let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. she yelled ""oooo boy!! you told me you finished that yesterday! guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! you, ya little liar!!!"" his head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

a few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. he looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, i thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" his look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days.

i went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. he said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. i get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but i said i still wanted to press charges. the officer said i literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

"for catfishing my underaged sister on tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?. last week, i was using my sister ashley's phone because mine was dead and i needed to call a friend to confirm plans. dialing my friend's number, i saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. immediately, i asked why she's on tinder (she's 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said ""none of your business"" 

i decided that i wanted to have a little fun with this. i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she's just swiping for fun?) so i didn't want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. to test if she was just using for fun, i decided i was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. i asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) kevin if he'd mind if i used his pictures and explained the situation. he thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

i created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister's account. her age was set to 19 (lie, she's still in **high school**) so i was definitely more suspicious of her now. i superliked and less than an hour later, she matched and messaged me. 

i decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for sunday afternoon and told her we could ""head to my place afterwards"". she was completely receptive and said she'd meet me there. she told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

after she left, i told our parents everything and showed them all of the messages. they were pissed, and i suggested we all go to the restaurant. my dad and i just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for ""jim"". my dad went up to her and said ""jim's not coming"" and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. i told her that there was no jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. my dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger's* place. we were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

i told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said i was a ""fucking dick"" and ""cruel"" to her. my other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. wondering who's right and if i went too far?

edit: yes, when i asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would've had sex with jim. that's why i went the extent that i did.

alright after reading all these judgments, i came to the conclusion that i'm ta. but i'm ta she needed. if anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.

"being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are.. people should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. my first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

edit: a couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. that doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. this extends to your community. what i am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

i wanted to give you kind people an update that is well overdue. first though, i'd like to take a moment to thank you (most of you) for your support and kind words. for the most part the community came through with useful advice. i really needed help and felt extremely lonely during my original post. i thank you from the bottom of my heart. 


an now on to the update. i'm 39 now and my husband is 37. i was able to see a therapist a day or two after my original post and had a good cry while hashing out the whole story. i told the therapist about the advice i got here (she hadn't heard of reddit) and she agreed as well. i went through with the pregnancy. my husband had the option (obviously) to stay or leave. he decided to stay. 


not only did he decide to stay, but he's the happiest he's ever been in his life. reminder: we were a childless couple and did not plan on ever having kids. our daughter has brought so much love into our hearts that we are both amazed. i see the world in a different way now that i have her. he loves our daughter with every bit of himself. amazingly my love has grown for this man. he has told me that she has opened up parts of his heart that he never knew was there. i understand what he means. the happiness that i feel is beyond words. both my husband and i are so thankful that we had our daughter. we talk about it every month or so and can't believe how much we would have missed out if we didn't have her. to top it all off, we have decided to have another baby! 


so thank you, reddit. your support helped me through a difficult time. i hope that those of you that took the time to comment on the original post see this update. 


edit: holy schmoly reddit. pinned and gilded for the first time! thank you for the gold, kind stranger. thank you to all of the wonderful, positive messages. i have read and appreciate every one of them. i'm glad that sharing my story brought a smile to so many faces (or tears of joy in some cases!).

hi all!

wow - so, this post got a lot more traction than i expected. first of all, i want to thank all of you for your advices and showing your concerns not just for myself, but, for my wife. it means a lot.

now, onto the update.

for easter, we already had plans with her family to go to church and then have a bbq at her sister's. not wanting her family to see any tension, i saw this as a chance for her to have to speak to me. as we're getting ready for church, i tell her that we need to talk about everything now. she agreed and sat down with me.

i did tell her that there is absolutely no way we're naming our baby after her ex (or, any of our kids, if we have even more). she agreed and apologized for acting irrational.

also, i know a lot of you suggested that i get a paternity test. i know that i'm 100% the father. i didn't want anyone to get my anxiety up since, while it may seem rational, jumping into an extreme conclusion and making things worse. i thought it out, but, i still did ask if she was still in love with her ex and is she did cheat. she adamantly said no. she had already stopped loving him, even before they broke up. she tried to make the relationship work, but, she just wasn't in love with him anymore. she described him as not being a good person at all.

she apologized for making me feel that way.

i told her that i understand she's going through a lot of emotions right now and being pregnant doesn't help at all. but, i had to ask on why she would want to name our baby after him, even after all she has told me. 

she started to get choked up and was shaking. i told her that she could tell me. 

she confessed that when her and her ex broke up, the last thing she told him was that she wished he would fall off his bike and die. also, the bike that he died riding on was a bike that she strongly suggested that he buy, even though it wasn't his first choice.

she also talked about how accidentally getting pregnant and her ex suddenly dying is a lot for her to handle. she wasn't expecting to be a mom so soon and her life is about to change when she really didn't want it too. she talked about how she thought we'd travel and that she'd continue racing her motorcycle. now, she's not even sure if she'd be able to ride again. she actually thought she might be able to ride again once she had the baby, but, her ex's death reminded her how much of a risk it is. she doesn't want to risk her life when she has a family. she feels gutted. 

regardless, she kept stressing out to me on how she wouldn't change a thing about her life now and that she's happy to be married to me and is going to be a mom. we're the best things that has ever happened to her.

anxiety also runs in my wife's family. my wife gets intrusive thoughts about how her ex died too. it's so bad that she has a hard time sleeping sometimes. 

after discussing things, she decided that she'll be going into therapy.  she has her first appointment this week.

tldr: wife feels guilty about ex's death after persuading him to buy the motorcycle that he died on and telling him she wished that he'd fall off his bike and die. she keeps thinking about how he died. wife also said that she's happy to be married and is going to be a mom, but, there's a lot going on and it's a lot. she's sad that she probably can't ride motorcycles anymore. wife will go into therapy this week.",8

"meta ""the asshole"" is not neccesarily ""an asshole"".. sometimes on this sub, op's and commentors alike seem to get this idea that when they are judged ""the asshole"" that they are being personally attacked and insulted. 

just because yta, doesn't mean you're a dick, douche, jerk, etc. it just means you were in the wrong in the situation you posted about. commentors aren't insulting you personally when they call you ""the asshole"". ^^tm that's just the vernacular we use here. 

so, yes, op. you're the asshole. but that doesn't mean you're a bad guy.(https://i.imgur.com/oqqilfk.gif)

"for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?. so i'm 17 and i used to be morbidly obese. i was actually morbidly obese until last year when i decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. i'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and i feel really great. i went from 130kg to 70kg and i'm 5ft 9

anyways my sister eats horribly. she is morbidly obese. my parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

anyways i saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. the sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. my mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. it's absolutely insane i think and there was nice coke can to go with it. i told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. i offered her a piece of tofu in which i was having for lunch. tofu is actually delicious. more people should try it.

 she told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that i'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when i was a child(i wish someone did). apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. my mother said i wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

was i in the wrong?",3

"for telling my daughter 26f that i 55m will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad 50m.. my wife and i divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since i was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her. i knew from many stories i've heard that my daughter would probably end up being closer to him than me, since not only was our time together very limited but he was a stay at home dad, which means they had plenty of time to bond together which makes me feel sick to this day. this may sound immature but i made her promise to never ever call her stepdad(dad), that i was her only father and to not betray me. but i have no control over what she or they do in their home. fast forward to now my prediction came through and she's obviously closer to her step dad than me. she has gotten engaged about a year ago and now that the wedding is approaching near(1 month or so)  she's now out of the blue told me that she wants both me and her stepdad to walk her down the aisle after promising me i would be the one to do it. even though i know they're very close, i don't believe he has any right to walk my blood daugther down the aisle. i am her only father, it isn't fair that he got to be with my daugther more than me, her bio dad, and now he wants to take this moment from me too. i got a bit angry and told her i absolutely will not share an honor that is meant for me the actual father of the bride with some guy i barely know. she told me he's done a lot for her growing up and that i'm being petty over something that happened years ago. i told her i wasn't going to argue about it and if she wants her stepdad to walk her she can, but i won't be there to see it. 

i was told by a friend of mine who uses this site quite often that many people have gone through something similar to this with their kids or parents, so i wanted to see other people's perspective, on if it's wrong for me to want to be the only one to walk my only daughter down the aisle.",3

"there is a group of wolves in british columbia known as ""sea wolves"" and 90% of their food comes from the sea. they have distinct dna that sets them apart from interior wolves and they're entirely dedicated to the sea, swimming several miles everyday in search of seafood.. ",5
"it is important to note that you get the courage after you do the thing that you are so anxious and terrified of doing, not before.. ",9
"that in the 1950's, donut shops were some of the first food businesses commonly open late at night. they became hot spots for police working the night shift since it gave them a place to grab a snack, fill out paper work, or even just take a break. this is why donuts became associated with cops..

"we should domesticate bears.. i don't see why not? no more need for cars, because you could just ride your bear around town and look cool as fuck, while being environmentally conscious. no more need for guns, because who needs a gun when you have a 2000 pound bear guarding your home at night. no longer will your children lose toys, balls, etc. in trees, because your friendly household bear is great at climbing trees. there are literally thousands of problems that could be solved by domesticating bears, and every moment we don't we are just wasting time. 

edit: for everyone saying that this is a popular opinion, it obviously isn't popular enough because i'm still not riding a bear to work tomorrow, damnit ",6
