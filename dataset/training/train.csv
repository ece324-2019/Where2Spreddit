"A 32 yo man picked up my 16 yo daughter from school (with her consent, obviously without mine) and they had sex shortly after. Do we have any legal recourse? [MI]","The child is my step daughter. She was picked up from school after a half day while her mother and I were working. After she was picked up, they went to the man's place and had sex (it doesn't matter, but she was a virgin prior to this). 

She was then dropped off near our home and walked in our home before her mother or I were home yet. She met the man via a mobile app days earlier. This all came out today during her counseling appointment (she has ongoing issues with anxiety and a lack of friends/feelings of acceptance).

Ignoring the fact I am unbelievably upset with her and will be dealing with that situation separately - do we have any legal recourse against this man?

I believe the age of consent in Michigan is 16, but I do not know how that works as far as getting picked up directly from school without permission from parents and if that is allowed. To the best of our knowledge no pictures were exchanged.

FWIW I understand and accept the fact that my step daughter made this decision on her own, and that it is jointly a failure of us as her parents that this happened (read: I do not blame the man for this happening 100% as the step daughter and we as parents should have done better, but I need a place to direct my anger).

EDIT: One thing I forgot to include was she said he gave her a marijuana vape pen to use, if that matters at all. Marijuana is now legal in our state as of a few months ago, but certainly not for a 16 year old.",legaladvice

Update:AITA for objecting to 'girls day'?,"Hello,

This is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

This last month has been kind of wild for me so I haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. So the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. Due to the fact that I had deactivated my Facebook and was only receiving text messages, I didn't realize what was happening before I was ambushed by it. My sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and I confirmed that it was. And she insisted I was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. I responded that I in no way did that as I was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

This spread to my family and now the thread was shared on Facebook and everyone was shown. I was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where I was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what I did was wrong and demanded an apology. They said that 'I knew' they weren't excluding me and because I gave everyone that impression I owed them an apology. I replied that I absolutely did NOT know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). Once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. I replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-OP event, not a girls only event.  They explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether I was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because I'm not a girl. At this point we were going around in circles so I just explained my perspective, I said that I'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it I feel excluded. I explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation I was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

At the end of this family meeting, I was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and I was accused of many things that I didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. I told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that I was going no contact for a while. I told them I'm an adult, and I have my own life, and the reason I wanted to be involved was because I didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. If that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but I told them that I was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. My mother/sisters told me that if I was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. At this point, my relationship with my family is over, I left that family meeting and have not reactivated Facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. Que sera, sera. ",AmItheAsshole
LPT: Increase your offers to help a friend who is mourning about 6 weeks after the death of their loved one. This is the point at which the initial wave of support has died off and people are particularly vulnerable.,"A wise leader of a church taught me this.  He had helped many through the grieving process. When a close friend of mine lost a loved one tragically, I asked him what I should do to help them.  He taught me that often, the hardest time for people while grieving was when the initial wave of condolences had gone away and people don't really know/forget to offer help anymore.  Meanwhile, the person grieving has to start trying to transition back to ""normal life"" and routines and they are often left more lonely than ever. **(Note , I have noticed that this jump in time to support can be much sooner that six weeks, sometimes it is a soon as a few day).


To be clear, offering to help initially is great and important as well but consistent continued support is priceless.

AITA because I refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? I low key hate her.,"I'm 15 years old. I have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. I'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. She also doesn't understand stuff. That's probably the easiest way to put it. She's just a human body with nothing inside. 

She's my stepmoms daughter. My stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. I don't know my stepmom very well and I don't really get on with her. We are respectful to each other but I'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. I am always on my own and I used to hate it but I'm used to it now.

Ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. That's fine, I get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that I don't want to do and I resent doing. Stuff like staying home when I want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that I don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

My own mom passed away when I was small so I can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all I'm just a lot more angry than I used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever I say I don't want to do anything for her. Even stuff like feeding her- like- I don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. I didn't ask for this. 

Anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. She was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. I don't want to go and visit her. I remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and I just hate hospitals and I sort of hate my stepsister and I just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know I'm there. 

My stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. They haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because I don't want to visit. My grandma who lives in Canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and I don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so I'm assuming my dad has told her I'm refusing to go. He keeps pleading with me but I keep telling him I'm not doing it. I told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and I need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom. 

I just want to know what Reddit thinks because half my friends think I should go and the other half think I'm justified in saying no.",AmItheAsshole
"My mother is on her deathbed, I am her only child, she does not have a Will and cannot sign one in her current state, her caregiver for the past 20 years just put my mother's house in her own name. Is there anything I can do?","This is currently happening in Kansas. Because there is no Will I understand her estate will go into probate. The caregiver/woman, let's call her Becky, has lived in her house the past 20 years and has a dark past. Although I am grateful to Becky in many ways for caring for my mom, she has lived in the house and has been my mother's power of attorney for the past 10 years. Becky has been spending my mother's social security and disability checks which amount to over $3,500/month. My mother was a teacher for 30+ years and had/has really good retirement. Becky is a certifiable hoarder and has filled the house with piles and piles of cheap junk over the past 20 years. I mean, we're talking about the conditions where you see hoarders on TV where there are small pathways to walk and everything else is piled high with stacks and stacks of, I don't know what. Becky doesn't even use the entire basement which was previously her living space, because of all of the stuff so densely packed. Now the upstairs is looking more and more like the basement. Due to M.S. my mother has been bed-ridden for the past five years. During this time Becky has been taking care of her with periodic help from Nurses and Aids. My mom is now in Hospice care and has been having small to medium strokes. I am told the end is near. I have visited her multiple times and Becky told me after she passes and makes all the arrangements, she will sell the house and we will split the profits. She wasn't specific. I am the only child, there is no one else. I found out today that Becky had to pay $300 to get the house in her name. I didn't even realize this was possible. Becky has mountains of debt even with my mom's checks she cashes each month along with her own disability check of around $1,000/month, Becky has always been in debt and has lived like this for a couple of decades. This is Kansas which is super cheap as far as taxes and cost of living. She always has excuses for where the money goes each month. I can't keep track of her terrible spending month after month. And Becky gets super angry and defensive whenever I approach the subject. I have a feeling that when my mom eventually dies, Becky won't want to leave the house. Or she will leave and pocket the entire money from the sale of the house. I'm sure she will have some sob story or excuse for why she needs it. She is already talking about getting multiple storage facilities for her piles of crap. I'm not sure what to do or if there is anything I can do. If anyone has an idea of where I could start I would appreciate it.

Edit: Thank you all so very much for the great advice. I am going to contact the adult care tomorrow and a lawyer first thing on Monday morning. I am a good person and will definitely consider Becky in all final decisions. I intend to split the estate with her, but this is not my main concern. Becky is ill herself and has taken advantage of my mom, however I do believe she loves her as a close friend. Becky has made horrible choices and due to past family trauma I allowed this for many years because I just didn't have the capacity to deal. I am ashamed of this, but am now ready to buck up as Becky doesn't have the mental sense or financial restraint to handle this on her own. Thanks again!",legaladvice
I (27M) found pictures of my girlfriend (23F) topless on the beach at night with strangers,"A bit of background: My girlfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We have lived most of this time at a distance, because both of us did periods of study abroad, now we live in the same country but different cities , about 2-3 hours of driving away from each other. We manage to spend together almost every weekend, and we were used to much bigger distances when we were living in different european nations, so the distance we have now is no big deal. I'm currently working in my hometown (which is her hometown too), she is still studying for her master's degree and will finish in one year. Recently I got a job opportunity in her city and thought it would have been nice to work there for one year and stay together. I didn't previously plan to go there, but I was contacted for a position by an ex colleague of mine and I liked the company. She's renting a house with one male flatmate and I suggested her to leave that house and rent a place with me instead. This was all just to test the ground as I wasn't even interviewed yet, but wanted to talk to my girlfriend before that. She told me she is not ready to live together and wanted me to rent a separate place, she said she would stay often at my place but wanted to keep her own too. Given this reaction, I didn't want to move there anymore, instead she insisted that she wanted me to move, but in a separate house. This made no sense for me, because the job was nice but nothing I couldn't find everywhere else, and my hometown is bigger and has more jobs in my field, the main reason I wanted to move was to stay with her. I told her that given that she wasn't ready to share an apartment with me, I would look for jobs in other cities and go where I could find the better opportunity, in my country or the neighboring one. After we had this conversation, she left for 10 days to go on a vacation at the sea with a friend. 

&#x200B;

The fact: When she was on vacation, she partied every night and posted a lot of pictures where she was dancing and drinking. I was naturally a bit jealous but I thought she was innocently having fun. I'm also on vacation by the sea, in a different place, where my family has a flat, and invited her here when her previous vacation was over, so two days ago I went to pick her up at the airport and brought her here. The morning after she was showing me pictures of her vacation on her phone, and while scrolling she suddenly ends up on something she does not want me to see and locks her phone in embarrassment. The only thing I saw in that moment was a picture of her leaning on a guy, and thought that was what she didn't want me to see. At this point I was angry knowing she wanted to hide something from me. We stopped talking to each other for an hour then she came to show me the pictures and apologize. She showed me this picture of her on the beach at night, with 4 boys and another girl, going for a midnight swim. All other people were wearing swimsuits, but she didn't have one, so she was was with her underwear and no bra. She was wearing an open men shirt, borrowed from one of the guys, with her tits out in the open. I don't know the people in the picture, she says they are her friend's friends. I'm heartbroken since I saw that picture and I feel like my entire life has crumbled to pieces. I would have never expected her to do this to me, and I also don't understand why she would be so lacking of self-love to just show herself to strangers like this. I asked her for explanation multiple times yesterday and got different responses. Her story is this: she was wearing no bra but wanted to swim and didn't want to wet her t-shirt so borrowed a shirt from one of the guys. She said she closed the  shirt and it just happened that the picture was taken meanwhile she was closing it. This makes no sense because she was actively posing in the picture and making a face for the camera. Later she told me that she was upset for our discussions about cohabitation and wanted to do something reckless to forget about our problems for a while.

&#x200B;

I sent her away on a train this morning and told her I want to spend my vacation alone and told her I'm considering breaking up. Right before she hopped on the train we both started crying and I held her in my arms for a couple minutes.

&#x200B;

I feel what she's done justifies breaking up, also I'm not sure if those pictures show everything or are just the tip of the iceberg. However, it's very difficult for me to break up. Our relationship has been perfect up to this time, we shared a lot of intense moments together, thought she was the love of my live and always loyal to me, was planning everything for a future together. Those have been 5 beautiful years and it's hard to imagine my life without her. However, this thing came as a punch to my stomach and I don't feel I can trust her anymore afterwards. Is there a way to recover or are we done for?

I'm hating her for what she has done to me, but am terrified of losing her and would feel miserable without her. When I told her I'm considering breaking up she said she would do everything in the world to get back with me, that I'm all her life, and that she's ashamed of what she did.

TIFU by quoting Thanos while arguing with my GF,"Trowaway account for privacy, this happened yesterday and I don't know how to make it up.

My girlfriend and I met at university 4 years ago, and we both graduated some time ago. Since then we've both been looking for work, but the research is more difficult than we thought, and until yesterday neither of us had managed to get a job. Yesterday my girlfriend received a positive answer to one of her applications, for a job located 430 kilometers from our hometown. She was very happy and that's how she told me to come to her house to tell me some good news about the research. So expecting some good news, I took a detour to buy her sushi because we both love it, and I arrived at her house early in the evening, and that's when she tells me that in two weeks she's going to go more than 400 kilometers from our city, and that I now have to look in the same area as her. I totally lost my mind when she told me that. I explain that I understand that the research is complicated, but that it was no reason to look at work across the country, and that I had no desire to leave my family and friends because my life is in my hometown. The situation then became very tense, she told me that I am selfish and that I have to learn to move away, that even if there is no urgency, it is important to find a job quickly so as not to remain inactive. I then offered her a long-distance relationship for a few months because I really don't want to leave, and she could come back as soon as she found a job in our city. And that, guys, she took it really hard, I've never seen her so upset in my life. She then gave me an ultimatum: either I follow her or we stop our relationship, and she asks me if I'm really ready to leave her to stay with my family and friends. Maybe some people can see it, but this is the moment I fucked up.

I still don't know why my brain betrayed me like that, but the only answer I could find was : ""Perhaps, maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation"". I could have made long rants to show her that I love her, that I care about her. I could have found arguments so that we could solve the situation, as any person in a relationship for 4 years would do. But no, my fucking stupidity made me quote a purple guy. She looked at me with an empty look for several seconds, I realized how much I fucked up, but nothing came from my mouth. She just asks me to leave her house, and since yesterday she speak to me or answer my calls and messages. I sent her a very long message of apology, adding that I hope we will be able to resolve the situation, but still no answer.

I am now staring my Thanos funko pop thinking how much this guy may have ruined part of my life.

&#x200B;

EDIT : Whoah, this blew up far more than I could imagine. I took time to read all your comments, and I spend a big part of my day speaking with my GF about the situation. So here's the situation : 1) She's mad that in such a situation my only answer was quoting a meme, 2) She thinks (and she's not the only one from what I read) that I'm still a child for wanting to stay in my city.

To clarify some things I'm living in a small country in Europe, that's why 400km is basically across the country. Then I admit it, I may not be ready to start my professional life. In my head I'm still a student who always wants to enjoy his life like it was : going out with friends, enjoying parties in the middle of the week, watching sports and taking care of my GF. For me, the best to start my work life was to find a job in my city to keep my bearings and my way of life and to be able to gradually switch to something more serious. That's a big part of why a freaked out when she told me to come far away from everything that defines my life. Also yes, there was a big lack of communication in my relationship, she's the first to admit it and apologizes for it.

Today we had a more serious discussion (no meme quotes guys !) where both of us expressed their point of view. For my GF, this work is not her dream work, but she wants to take it because we can't find nothing here and she just wants to take it in order to gain experience, and then quit it to a better opportunity. She told me that it would only be a matters of months. I explained my feelings and what I wanted to start my life, and to my surprise she understood. We even reached an agreement : I will looking for a job in my city and in the city where she will work, and i will take the first opportunity. She also needs me to be with here the first month to help her settle in and not to stress about her new situation.  Now that we've explained and reached a compromise, she's much calmer and ready to go on, so it seems my stupidity and the purple guy may have not ruined something.

Oh, I saw some people were wondering : when I left her house yesterday, I didn't take back the sushi

&#x200B;

TLDR : GF finds a job far away from our city and I doesn't want to leave my life to live this far. She asks me if I'm really ready to leave her just to stay in my city and my only answer was ""Maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation"".",tifu
"Stop remaking great films and start remaking movies that could have been great, but were poorly executed","All the time we hear stories about films with so much hype but had production issues, cast issues, etc. There's some great scripts that will probably never see the light of day because they were poorly executed on. We should remake those movies instead of ones that have already been executed greatly. 

Edit: ppl keep saying studios wouldn't do this so it's useless. Dark tower in an example of great source material (Steven Kings  magnum opus) but the film was godawful. Studios could draw back a crowd if it was remade well. Hancock is another one - the movie did okay but the original material was so different and in my opinion could have been a lot better. Prometheus was an awesome idea but didn't really get as deep as I had hoped. All three of those I think were great ideas, poorly executed that would still make money as a remake if done right.

Personally I think the words *petulant* and *hemorrhage* are a little bit gross-sounding, but they are words for a reason and I'm not going to throw a conniption fit if somebody uses them. It's not like they're slurs.

EDIT: I might have been a bit harsh in my wording. I know it's just my opinion, and some people are grossed out by it. I understand why some people have a negative association with the word, but I just don't associate it with bodily fluids unless it's used in that context. Obviously I'm not going to double down on using it if it truly does bother somebody. I'm not an asshole.

I mixed up the words *petulant* and *pustulent,* but the two words do sound somewhat similar. Obviously the reasons *pustulent* and *hemorrhage* are gross sounding is because of what they mean. I'm not going to avoid them if I need to use either.",unpopularopinion
"[Update] Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

Original Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant\_is\_renting\_out\_my\_apartment\_on\_airbnb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

Just wanted to thank you all for your support/advice, i was really dumb and naivee when it comes to renting out my apartment. The last time i rented it out the tenant left on time, and i never actually thought about what could happen if they didn't leave.

I have started the process of evicting the tenant today, with support from a local lawyer who is going to handle a bunch of the paperwork for me, and represent me.

My condo board thankfully has been super understanding as soon as i outlined that it was being done without my knowledge, and they have agreed to wave the penalties. Apparently there were noise complaints on Friday relating to my apartment which annoyed our condo board. Our concierge service (we have someone at the front desk 24/7), will no longer be allowing people to leave keys for people at the front desk.

On Sunday two people came in to the building asking for keys to my unit, and our concierge  service asked if they were AirBnB tenants, and they said yes. He then basically told them to leave right away, and they aren't welcome here.

Jane finally got in touch with me today, and basically accused me of numerous things, from harassing her renters, to just in general making her life difficult. She also stated that she will be going to the LTB to ""make a formal complaint because banning AirBnB is not allowed"". When i pointed out that as people have told me here that she needs to get  my permission before renting out to other people.

Men respect women more than women respect men,"I know this sounds contrary to everything you've heard, but hear me out. From guys, I hear plenty of stupid comments. ""Women are crazy"" ""Women are too emotional"" ""Women overreact to everything"". It's either making dumb jokes from their buddies or wondering why their girlfriend/wife is angry with them. 

But I've only heard genuine loathing from women. ""Men are all the same"" ""Men are trash"" They're monsters, creeps, and on and on. And it isn't just certain men. I've heard multiple women say that all men are like that, not just certain individuals. I've never heard any man say they hate all women, but I've heard women say they hate all men. 

Lesser examples include the results from unhappy breakups. When men rant, it's about someone specific: ex-girlfriend or wife. If a woman's angry, it's a rant about the entire male gender. This is a generality of course and I can only speak from my own experience. 

Then there's the constant messages to men about how to treat women. Teach your son to respect women, teach men to respect women; treat your girlfriend like a princess, etc. Constant posts about how men don't have empathy for women. But very rarely have I seen it in reverse. I've encountered it maybe twice in my life. Many messages talking about how we need to respect women; very little about respecting men.

AITA for serving myself the biggest piece of meat?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for about 2 1/2 years. We live together as of recently (4 monthsish) and we get along pretty well. We have a lot of separate hobbies, and one of mine is hiking. I wouldn't call myself a ""peak bagger"" but I do like to add mountain summits to my hikes when I can. BF doesn't enjoy hiking more than occasionally so he rarely comes along. 

For reference, I am a 5'3"" 150lb woman. He is a 5'7 170lb guy. 

On Sunday I went for a long, strenuous hike with my friends. If you're familiar, it's 13er James Peak in CO. It was a 9 mile, 3,000ft elevation gain hike (from where we started). I had a fun time and went home and did my usual workout (short run, weights, some light yoga) after. Suffice to say, I was pretty hungry by dinner time. I made dinner, which was grilled chicken with lots of grilled veg, some pasta salad as a side. When it came time to eat, because of my big day, I grabbed the bigger piece of chicken. We're talking a 5oz piece versus a 7oz piece. 

BF got upset about this when he saw my plate versus hit place, and he made a pretty big deal out of it. He told me that there's no reason for me to serve myself such a big piece of meat, he's the guy and he should have it. I told him that I'd hiked and done my workout that day, and that he puttered around the house and went for a short (5 mile) run. 

He told me that growing up, he was always taught that the man got the biggest piece of meat because men need more to sustain themselves in general. I said that I agreed, but again, I'd climbed a mountain that day and burned much more than he did. He told me I should accept the good calorie deficit, or load up on the pasta salad and veggies instead. 

We've been arguing about this for days and he tagged some friends in and asked his parents (who said to keep them out of it, lol). So far people are split, some believe even if he didn't do much that day it's just weird for a woman to actively try to eat more than her boyfriend. I think that's stupid and outdated and comes from a time when men tended to do more physical labor in general.

"AITA for pretending to be an ""Appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?","I got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""Appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

I told them them all that I had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. When I first told them they thought I was joking, but they underestimated how committed I would be to a joke. So, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) I was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

Apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

Finally after about a week they bought that I had become an Appletarian. They started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. Some of them even got angry.

But I wanted to stick with the joke. Finally, after the end of 3 weeks, I walked into what I was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

They were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. Finally I started laughing hysterically. They were confused as hell so I told them I had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. I even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

I thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. My girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago I had ruined our date night when I told the waiter I only wanted apples because I was an Appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

In my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

But, did I go too far?

Weed absolutely can be addicting and have negative consequences so it should not be represented as wonderfully as it is in the legalization movement,"I was a smoker/stoner for about the last 5 years and I can honestly say that I really struggled to quit and I still relapse from time to time. It was my go-to way to ""relax"" and ""have a good time"" but it allowed me to take the easy way out instead of finding other opportunities for hobbies or time with friends and family or meeting new people. As a result I find myself craving that escape from 'normal' life and I don't have the skills to find something enjoyable to do on an uneventful evening. I want to smoke so bad but I know for me personally it makes me lazier and a less productive employee. At this point I really do feel like I'm recovering from an addiction.

Weed was also my 'gateway drug' as ridiculous as that claim seems to be for many people. I would never have considered other drugs until I felt how good it was to be high.

But the legalization movement characterizes weed as this wonderful thing that was wrongly made illegal. They seldom talk about these negative consequences to life and make it seem like nothing is bad about it.

That being said, I think it should be legal, we just need to respect it as the drug that it is and be clear that it is not for everyone and can cause harm to peoples lives. For some it is truly a live saving medicinal drug, so it should definitely be available to these people. But focusing the legalization effort on how much it does for people with difficult medical conditions paints weed in a much better light than it should be for the general population. 

Sorry for the rant I just had to get this out there.

TL;DR: Weed can be harmful for many people's lives so it should not be portrayed as this wonderful thing for society as legalization takes off.

I [26M] upset a woman [20sF] and my friends are acting like I'm in the wrong.,"Hey guys.

I went out clubbing last night with my friends. There were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. My girlfriend Hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. I offered to stay in with her but she insisted I go out and have a good time. 

At the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. They were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

One of them, Lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. She was pretty but I was not interested as I have a girlfriend. I told her this but she then started asking for pics of Hannah. I showed her and she said that I ''could do better than that''. I was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

Later me and my friends were dancing, and Lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. I gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. A while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. She smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. I was absolutely fuming and in response I poured my beer on her head. She started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

Everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. I understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like I was wrong to pour my drink on her. They all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

The ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when I pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

Nobody said goodbye to me last night and I made my own way home. I told Hannah what happened and she agrees that I didn't do anything wrong. I tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

How do I sort this out in a mature way?

My sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on September 1st. It's been a very hard couple of days and I've been grieving, as has my family.

I wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. She normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. We will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us. 

My family is now in the process of planning her funeral and laying her to rest. She will always be in our hearts and I know she's in a better place and not in pain.

I (23F) genuinely think that there's someone living in my attic.,"I'm not sure this is the right place to post but it made the most sense to me. I have reasonable suspicion that someone is squatting in my attic or accessing it on a regular basis. 

To note. The house hadn't been lived in for about 4 months prior. And is in an OKAY area of Cleveland, OH. 

I've been moved in for about a month and a half - I've heard whats sounded like footsteps at first more than a handful of times but then I've just chucked it up to being new house sounds. I'll be honest and say I've been too scared to see if anything's up there since I've moved in so I've never even seen the attic. Today my sister and her boyfriend were staying over for the holidays so I asked him to check it out. He popped up with a flashlight and there's a tent set up. He came down and told me. My sister and I came outside and he locked the back door and came out the front. The back door is directly in front of where the attic opens. We called the cops and waited about ten minutes. Once the cops arrived the back door was unlocked and no one was in the tent. Cops didn't do anything and didn't even go up to check. They were neato. So I put my head up to check while they were there. It's a tent. There's playing cards. They took my name and left. 

Sooo I nailed the attic shut and blocked all entries to my home. I was thinking first thing I should do is get new locks and window monitors in the morning. 

Other than that - Do I hire someone to check the house? Do I call the cops again another day?  
Should I not stay here alone?

UPDATE: My other sisters boyfriend came over today and the two of them went up there and scooped it out. It looks like a weird grow op. Can't can't if anyone was there. To me it doesn't look like it. But it's strange regardless

TIFU by taking a picture of my wife's ass,"This happened about a week ago.

&#x200B;

I  took my wife to Barns & Noble to get some new books for us to read.  I was half halfheartedly looking at different books while trailing my wife throughout the store. At some point I realize my wife is nowhere to be  seen, but whatever I'll find her eventually.

&#x200B;

After  a few minutes of mindless wandering, I notice her on the other side of  the store. I also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as I'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, I hear someone behind me shout ""HEY CREEP! WHY ARE YOU  TAKING A PICTURE OF THAT GIRLS ASS!?"" I turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

I  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. My wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that I had to leave. She explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&#x200B;

The employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. Honestly I'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. It was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. Shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

&#x200B;

TL;DRI took a picture of my wife's ass, an employee called me out for it, not knowing it was my wife. My wife left me high and dry until the manager asked me to leave. Everyone we know, now refers to me as ""the ass-man"" now.  

And before anyone starts polishing their armor, yes, my wife knows I do this. Yes, my wife is more than okay with it. She does the same thing to me.

&#x200B;

Edit: Just to clarify, my wife already had the picture in hand when she went up to confirm to the manager we were indeed married. The manager never doubted her affirmation that we were indeed married. I'm pretty sure she just wanted to show off her wedding dress again.

AITA for wanting a sunrise wedding?,"Every year on our anniversary, my fiance and I wake up early to go to the beach and watch the sunrise together. It's a very special tradition, as we have both overcome a number of personal challenges during our time together, and the symbolism of watching a new day begin is deeply meaningful for us. 

We decided we wanted to incorporate this into our wedding. Our plan is to have our ceremony on the beach the and have everyone walk over to a beachfront restaurant for breakfast, bloody Marys and mimosas (we've already talked to the restaurant owner about this, who loves the idea and said he'd be happy to open early for us). After that, everyone is free for the remainder of the day. Our friends and family are mostly local and should all be able to travel to the beach in under an hour, except for some extended family flying in from Canada, but that's unavoidable.

Based on our geographic location and the date of the wedding next summer, we've scheduled the ceremony start time for 5:30 a.m., when there should be plenty of light but the sun itself won't be quite visible yet.

Im pretty livid about this. I went out on a limb to try something i didnt want to, just to make her happy. And I feel like after all that she is finding a way to make this my fault.

As a result, I recently started exploring Chrome extensions, and man I wish I had done this earlier. Some will no longer be of use to me but I hope it can help others. 

[**Cite This For Me: Web Citer**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cite-this-for-me-web-cite/nnnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklkle?hl=en)
This one hurts me a bit as my days with MLA, APA, Harvard, and Chicago are coming to an end. The extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click, and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on. From my experimentation with it, it seems to work just as well as EasyBib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through.

[**Google Dictionary**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?hl=en)
If you get this extension, you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book (online). It's very simple, double-click or highlight over a word you don't know and it will define it for you. I imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular. 

[**Grammarly for Chrome**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)
I often use bad grammar and I know it. This extension gives me shit for it all the time, but it helps. It highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it. 

[**Readability**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/readability/oknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdi?hl=en)
This extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point. I would not trust it for anything in depth, but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article I'd give this a shot. 

[**SpeakIt!**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/speakit/pgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbak?hl=en-US)

I know I can't be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles. This app lets you highlight over text, you click a button, and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit. Or I guess you could take notes as you listen too...

It works in several different languages and accents (if you somehow understand German-English accents over the default one). You can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute. I could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain, but I would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too. 

[**Block & Focus**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-focus/dcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfm?hl=en)

Type in the websites that distract you *cough* and let this thing keep you away. Manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work. There are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot. 

[**MolView**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/molview/nogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnm?hl=en)

I haven't tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in O-Chem or higher. It allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally.

***Make a folder on your bookmark tab, and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there.*** Leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites. It will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites. 

***Use [sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me/) for your late night studies or binges.*** It's a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible. I cannot say it works every time, but this site has saved me some cranky days as I stayed up too late studying. 

***Use [RainyMood](https://rainymood.com/) to destress yourself.*** I'm sure many of you know about it but I love this one.

I'm sure I have missed a lot of good extensions and tips. Feel free to tell me any I should try out! 

**Use [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) to dim your PC screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep** -Credit to KreekyBonez for that one!

I hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations. It isn't really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib. **Always double check your writing if it is an important paper, especially with citations**. But if you're like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact. Just wanted to throw that out there as many Redditors have been commenting on those two extensions.

We should treat all Chinese Communist Party supporters the same way we treat Nazi party supporters,"The CCP is a totalitarian government hellbent on control through murder, rape, extortion and kidnapping. They are the modern day equivalent of the Nazi party in Germany. 

Anyone who supports such a horrific regime should be ostracized from society and treated the same way we treat Neo-Nazis. 

Even if the person is Chinese and claims they're only supporting their country. You wouldn't give a Neo-Nazi a break just because they're German, right?

To hell with the CCP! To hell with its supporters, regardless of which country they're from!

Edit: an off-duty Pro-CCP Hong Kong police officer just shot a 14 year old boy in the leg with a live round. Just another example of CCP unaccountability and brutality.

Edit: Please stop posting saying ""Err China isn't communist, it has billionaires, etc. Etc."". I know. And if you notice I didnt say anything about let's hate Communists right now.

Finally stood up to abusive husband,"Throwaway account as my sister in law lives on reddit. Me 30F finally got a back bone and stood up to my 32M husband. Long story so bare with me please.

We've been together for 6 years, married for 2. Everything was fine for the first 3 years. We met at work where I was an an intern, he was a manager. He was so sweet and really supportive of my ambitions and goals as I was of his and we clicked right away. We began dating and as time went on, I started climbing the ladder at my job and on our third year together, I was offered a managing director position....that's when everything went south.

When I was offered the position. I was over the moon, having been an intern on close to nothing , climbing my way up to a position where I'd earn more than enough money to look after both him and I and our future meant so much to me. When I told him, I thought he would be ecstatic especially as he has proposed to me a month prior and I had said yes, it was a great way to earn more money for the wedding and a house.

His responses was lacklustre and he said oh okay, I'll have to think about how I feel about this, turned around and walked out the door and left me for over a week. Wouldn't respond to my messages or calls. I was beyond sick and worried, I thought something had happened to him. He finally came back, over a week later (hadn't shown up at work either) strolls in like nothing happened and says, If you take this job, I'm leaving you. I was shocked and tried to talk about it about it but he said his feelings were final.

Like an idiot, I declined the job because I didn't want to lose him. He once again become sweet again and even though I wasn't earning as much, we were still together. A few months down the track and he starts being critical of my appearance and mental state. He says I've put on weight and should be focused on doing more around the house and working out and he isn't happy with our ""average"" sex life. This throws me for a 6 but I oblige and start working 9-5, getting up at 6 to go to the gym to lose the 10 pounds I had put on off , cleaning the house before I went to work, coming home and cooking every night and then trying to get more adventurous and sexy for him to spice things up.

I'm exhausted by this, meanwhile he goes to work 4 days a week, does no cleaning, plays video games and criticises every meal I cook. I really start losing self esteem at this point and start feeling depressed. He takes it upon himself to talk to my boss behind my back and then I end up having a meeting where my boss says, I think you're putting too much stress on yourself and we'd like you to take some time off. I was stressed and exhausted but work was the only place where I could escape. Even though it felt like shit, I decided to take some time off. While I was having time off my husband manipulated my work and kept telling me that I'm not of Sound mind, that I'm hopeless, that I'm a wreck and should quit my job. I told him no but he barraged me 24/7 and told me that there'd be no wedding.....we had already paid for 75% of it and some of that was a gift from my parents, I was scared of letting them down so in the end I relented.


Well we got married, I thought I could be happy but I was the shell of a woman I once was. Jobless, in a constant state of fear of what else he'd say was wrong with me. He took my phone, limited my internet time, isolated me and made me believe I could only depend on him and that I wasn't worth anything.

The last year has been hell, all I've wanted to do is sleep my life away, although I would t dare in fear of his retaliation, instead I spent my day cleaning and cooking, doing everything he wanted and yet he'd tell me I was ugly and stupid and would just demand sex because the least I could do was get him off.

I felt like a used puppet purely there to satisfy him and not be a full person. Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I found out I was pregnant, what should've been the happiest moment of my life, scared me to death. Some of you may judge me for this but it shook me to the core. I thought about this for a few days , didn't tell him but decided to secretly abort. I was devastated, I want to be a mom but I couldn't imagine subjecting a child to this life. I was numb for a while, I just continued on with everything until a few days ago. 

It hit me like a train, he was so abusive in such a manipulative way. I had given up so much of me to make him happy, I had aborted a child because deep down inside, I knew he is a piece of shit.

I found my car keys that he had hidden and my phone. I found a divorce lawyer, called up my old boss, I went to work, I marched in and said to my boss that I'd like my job back. He asked how my husband would feel about it and I said, I don't care, I know I'm good at what I do and I need the money to leave him. My boss clapped his hands and said welcome back and that the whole team would support me coming back into the work force.

My husband obviously had gotten home by this point and noticed my phone and car was missing, started blowing it up, sending me disgusting messages and telling me to get home now. 

I went home. I walked in, he started yelling and telling me that I've abused his trust by stealing ""my property"" without running it by him, that I should be ashamed. I told him that he can get fucked, we're over, I'm leaving him and he'll be hearing from my lawyer. He immediately started crying hysterically and begged me to stay, that we should work things out , I told him that all of these years I thought it was me who was lacking, but thanked him because it was because of that lie that he kept telling me that made me realise, I'm not lacking, I'm an educated, smart, intelligent person, I said but you knew that already, instead of celebrating me, you became insecure and tried to diminish who I was to make yourself feel better. I told him he was right to feel that way, I am better than him and that you can't polish a fucking turd and walked out, blocked him on all social media, notified all of our friends and family and I've never felt better. 

My question is, should I get someone to collect my things from our house or should I just leave them to avoid having to deal with him?


I'm really looking forward to 2019!

TIFU by smoking on my apartment balcony (this happened Saturday and was without question the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life),"This is long and will have a tldr at the bottom.

Saturday night my gf and i had my parents over for a  game night. We just moved into our new place last week Monday and wanted them to see it. We were waiting on my brother who was running late so i decided to have a smoke on my balcony. 

Everything is normal for the first few minutes. I'm just playing some ""free"" game I've spent way too much money on and not aware at all of my surrounding. Then it happened. A bug flew in my ear. Now this happens occasionally. A bug will fly and hit my ear and be on its way, but this little bastard decided my ear was going to be its new home and dug deep.

I immediately lost all semblance of self control and flung my phone and the chair i was sitting on and sprinted into the apartment while freaking out. The bug was digging or chewing and vibrating and that sound and feeling against your ear drum has to be the worst thing you can ever experience. My gf freezes, my father tells me to get in the shower and just fill my ear with water. I'm helpless at this point so i just follow my dads instructions. 

The bug did not like the water. It dug deeper. The noise and feeling got worse. I used a qtip to try to dig it out. All i got was blood. My father took a used water bottle from my recycling, poked a hole in the cap and used that to try to directly flush the bug. Nothing but more digging and moving. I am literally screaming everytime it moves. Both from the pain and the disgusting feeling i got when i felt it. 

My mother at this points takes off to run to a store to grab something she thinks will help. I barely notice she leaves but i hope to god she will save me. In the mean time, my gf reads that a couple of drops of vegetable oil can suffocate the bug. So my dad opens our brand new bottle of oil and dumps it in my ear.   At this point my entire body is covered in oil. I could have used concrete as a slip in slide. I'm naked in my shower with a bug in my ear, topped of with oil, holding the shower curtain over my crotch trying to keep some bit of modesty all why freaking out at the chewing next to my brain. 

The oil does nothing but piss it off. We are talking about going to the hospital when my mother returns. She has what looks like the top of a turkey baster. Apparently this is something used to suck out booger's from babies noses. My father tries to use it at first because my limbs no longer work. He doesn't go deep enough because he doesn't want to pop my ear drum. I didn't care at that point because the bug was using it as an actual drum already so i managed to regain use of my arm, grabbed the thing and jammed it in my ear. It sucks the bug but it's too big to get it out. Too heavy for it to hold onto. 

My gf then fills it with water and suggests i use that to flush the bug. After 4 attempts, i finally feel some relief. I look down on my chest and see something far bigger than i expected. At this point I'm too freaked out to look closely and yell for her to look. She freaks because it's a moth. A good size moth. I again nearly shit myself and rinse it off. 

I can not do justice to this event in words. I can not accurately describe the noise, the feeling, the horror of this. Picture it yourselves. Imagine you have a dime sized bug in your ear scratching, biting, chewing, digging. Then realize it actually feels worse than that. 

If this was punishment for committing crimes, we would no longer need jails. 1 day with a bug in your ear would be enough punishment for murder and i can promise you they wouldn't do it again. 

I'd rather be waterboarded while listening to Barney on a loop. Those terrorists had it easy. 

I now wear my girlfriends bright pink beats headphones out while smoking and am strongly considering quitting. It shook me that much. 

TLDR: a bug flew in my ear while i was smoking. Stayed in there for half an hour while i tried everything conceivable to get it out. I finally did. It was more horrific than you can imagine.

Edit: I've tried to keep up with the comments so I'll answer some of them here.

I'm still flushing my ear regularly with peroxide. This morning i still found what i think is moth wing residue. I've made an appointment with my primary doctor for 130 this afternoon (eastern time zone US). I'll keep you posted on the egg situation haha. 

I'm now smoking a lot less and mostly when I'm driving . I feel like god would be after me if a bug managed to find its way in my ear driving down the road with the window down only a few inches. 

I didn't expect this to blow up but to everyone commenting saying it happened to them, I'm sorry. I feel your pain. 

To those saying moths don't bite, I'm not exactly a bug expert. All i know is the feeling, the sound, the blood, it was doing something in there that id really rather never experience again. It's truly an indescribable feeling and one i hope you never have to experience.",tifu

"My neighbor wants me to sell my house to his friend at much less than market value. He has threatened to ""scare away"" anyone else I show the house to.","I'm moving soon and need to sell my house. When my neighbor found out about this he had one of his friends take a look at it and he made me an offer far below what I would expect to get.

After I turned it down he became agitated. Since then he's been making thinly veiled threats about how he'll approach anyone else who sees the house and ""tell them ALL about the house in the interest of full disclosure"". He stressed the word ""all"" which leads me to believe he'll make up some pretty grandiose stories.

I can only conclude that he's expecting to get a cut from getting his friend the house at an extremely low price. Are there any laws against this? Do I have any legal recourse if he follows through with his threats?

The death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.,"Generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. Frankly, I believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

The child leaves almost nothing behind. It's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   On the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. They had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

I don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking I think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

Edit: spelling.

Edit 2: I never imagined This would get so popular. Answering to the comments now seems an impossible task, anyway I'd like to clarify some points some of you must have not grasp:
- I'm not saying the death of a child is worthless. To those who told me I should kill myself because I'm advocating the death of children (?), just know that you can't even fucking read
- of course  it depends on the situation, that's why a put ""generally"".
- it's not a competition but it doesn't mean things can't be discussed 
- English is not my first language, so if you think my grammar is shit I'm sorry but couldn't care less.

[meta] Think of the comments as an inverted Uber rating. (click to find out what this means),"Since two or three times a week we end up removing a few threads on why everyone keeps suggesting breakups, rather than micromanage the community, we figured this post would be prudent:

You know how every Uber rating is right on the verge of 5 stars unless something's particularly off? Everyone's all ""A+++ WOULD RIDE AGAIN."" Same for eBay, Amazon, etc.

Well, think of /r/relationship_advice comments as much the same, only inverted. Two things to always keep in mind:

1. The vast majority of people posting here are posting because they've got a challenge they probably haven't been able to resolve on their own. 

2. In many cases, these challenges are insurmountable (or just exceedingly difficult to deal with). 

**The majority of commenters aren't *necessarily* cynical/assholes, but combine both a one-sided account of what happened‚Äîyour account‚Äîwith each commenter's own potential history, grievances, etc., and the resulting brew is pretty dark,** meaning that every post will get drenched in comments like ""dump"" and ""lawyer up."" 

The _key_ is that the number of serious comments telling you to _consider an alternative to breaking up_ is a good way to tell whether or not there's merit to continuing what you've got going. Examples:

* Let's say you're asking whether a particular behavior is a red flag, and that behavior is so bad, the flag's not so much dyed red as it is _literally bleeding._ Nearly every single comment will probably tell you to run. Cool; **Zero Stars.** Shoot I might even lock the thread and tell you it's above our paygrade.

* Together but your s/o cheated on you once? Most comments will probably tell you to run because ""once a cheater, always a cheater."" Some comments might suggest you should stay and work it out, but the details of how the cheating happened might vary the number of these comments. Great; **One or Two Stars.**

* Married but your s/o got drunk and made out with someone else, felt awful about it, immediately left the event where they met that other person and told you what happened and apologized with no prior history of cheating? Many people might _still_ tell you to leave (same reason), but odds are good that equally as many people might tell you to consider staying. Awesome; **Two, maybe even three stars.**

* Good relationship with your S/O but they forget to treat you in the love language you normally need to thrive? Maybe they forget to bring you token flowers/trinkets or other signs of appreciation but otherwise everything's pretty good? Many comments will probably be advice on how to communicate; there'll probably still be a good number of downers but overall this would probably be in the **three to four stars territory.**^^_(This&nbsp;is&nbsp;uncommon.)_

* Everything's rosey and you're looking for a way to celebrate your s/o's special promotion, anniversary, birthday, or something else? Probably **four to five stars.**^^_(This&nbsp;is&nbsp;uncommon.)_

This applies to platonic, professional, and other relationships that aren't exactly romantic either, but for the sake of not needing a TLDR for the TLDR, I'm avoiding listing every single condition. You get the idea.

Basically, the people telling you to leave probably outnumber the people with less jaded opinions by an order of magnitude, so the best way to consider the advice is to see whether other advice shines through the background blackness of ""break up with them."" If everyone's telling you to break up, that's probably what you should do, but if 1/4 of the comments are telling you another way, you should definitely consider giving that 25% a chance.

You get the drift? 

---

##TL;DR: 

The vast majority of comments will tell you to break up. It's a side effect of the fact that many people who subscribe either have a very dim view of relationships or just do it for the drama. The more people tell you to consider something _other_ than breaking up, the more value there is in trying that other approach, whatever it is.

Fortunately, one of my neighbors shared the typed letter and hand written envelope with me. Other neighbors called my wife to tell her.

Anyway the consensus with my RL friends was I needed to tell her. We do Brunch on Saturdays because she does Yoga Sundays so we met up this morning. 

I could barely eat and she could tell something was up. She got worried thinking I was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

I sat her down and told her everything how I realized I was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. I told her that I never said anything because I did not want to jeopardize our friendship. Her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

I honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and I honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      Then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. She half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

We hugged and I told her that there is no one on this earth I would want to have a child with but her. We talked for hours ,in fact I just got home. We have decided that we want to focus on us for now. I want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

I know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end. 

However I am pretty sure if there is such things as soulmates she is mine.

We are really connected to each other, same passion, same likes and dislikes, we frequently travel together and all. We rarely fight, and when we do, we resolve issues quickly.. It's like a perfect relationship. We've been steady, we're genuinely happy in love.

Her ""I love yous"" weren't as enthusiastic. The way she talks and communicates with me feels different. She easily gets upset over trivial things. She seems to be a different person all of a sudden. I actually asked her what's wrong, but she assures me everything is ok and something is just bugging her.. I asked again but it seems she doesn't want to open up.. She assures me though that she loves me very much.

Then, just recently, like 4 days back, I was reminded that she has a spare phone just sitting on my drawer, phone was dead and was not used for almost la year.

* I cheated on him
* i cheated on him many times
* I cheated should we break up
* Breaking up a long term relationship... and so on

The searches were dated Feb 15 onwards. Almost everyday she looks on the same searches and other related topics.

Thank you to everyone who was nice enough to leave a response, I'll will be sure to talk to my friend tonight as I believe they are staying at my place for the next few weeks. 

Edit 2: Also, her death was ruled a suicide. Both of them were working when it happened. And my friend who was arrested, he is literally one of the nicest people you could meet.

UPDATE: 41M Questioning Sexuality After Making a New Friend,"Going forward I will be posting updates via my profile. If you'd like to follow me, I invite you. I will post updates as I have them until I have nothing left to update as well as answer questions!  


UPDATE #2 FOLLOWING MONDAY'S NOTRE DAME GAME:

Leading up to Monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download Snapchat, which I had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. I bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. He has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

Anyway, so Monday rolls around, I'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. I knew he'd have other friends there, all of which I'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. I get over there around 2. He has one friend already there and is expecting more. They trickle in and I'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. We cut up after the game, played some pool, James had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. I was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so I could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what I did. I did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. After some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

I asked James if we could talk outside. We walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""I know I kissed you the other day, and I don't know if that was something I should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. I've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and I think I may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" I was absolutely out there now. No turning back, I basically just told him I had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. He didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why I haven't brought it up before now. Obviously I told him I had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the KISS! He reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. I could come to him with whatever was on my mind and I just teared up. It wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. I gave him a hug and told him I appreciated that, we sat down and I explained to him how confused I've been these last couple weeks. How this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. I sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. He is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things I said, they were all comforting. He told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. He is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. Not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. A few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.I don't know what I would call the gut feeling I had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out WITH him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. Do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  I felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. I have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. He explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but I shouldn't be pressured. I wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. I turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. Full on made out for what seemed like ever. It was the most satisfying kiss I've ever had. This where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) I'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

By this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and I had to go. He walked me to my car and we made out a second time before I got in. He told me to get home safe and I did. I texted him to let him know I got home safe and hopped in the shower. I was so emotionally charged that I couldn't get to sleep until around 5 AM. I ended up calling out of work Tuesday. James and I have plans to hangout again this weekend. He wants to go out for food and a place called Topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, I've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. I'm really looking forward to it and I'm just taking things day to day at this point. I know where we stand and I'm happy.

Thank you for all of your support. I have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. I just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. You only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. I am learning this myself and I'm telling you, it's liberating.

I'll post any other updates here, above this one.  If anything big happens in the meantime I will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

Lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on Saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. I was very observant in our interactions, however, I didn't want to be so observant that I overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so I went with the flow and the vibes were great. We hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when I had the opportunity in conversation I mentioned that I had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and I told him that although I hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and I thought I might be curious to try it. I delivered this passively, just so not to put HIM on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. It felt like the time to make a move but I just didn't do it. We were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and I just didn't do it. It was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. Plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

Fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time I've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) We got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new NBA 2k20 demo on PS4, I'll admit I'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but I kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. At the end of the night, around 11p I went to leave, I had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. I went in for our hug, when I pulled back I kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and I laid it on him, I went right in and kissed him. It was short, I didn't use much tongue, but I pulled back and said ""I guess I can say I've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, I guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, I had one on mine AND IT WAS FIREWORKS IN MY STOMACH. I played it cool, I left and texted him when I got home that I was home safe and I thanked him again for a good time. He replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. He asked if I wanted to come over Monday night for the Notre Dame game and a cook out, I told him I'd love to and I'll bring some ribs to cook.

We have texted as normal today and I can't tell you how excited I am for Monday and to see what happens next. I know I waited awhile to update but I felt like I had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so I wanted to wait until I had more to report. I will post another update in the comment section here after Monday.

Thank you SO MUCH to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. I feel like I'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41.",relationship_advice

A husband notices his wife's hearing is deteriorating and decides to visit her doctor for advice.,"""I can't speak to my wife directly as she might find it offensive, given our old age"" he says to the doc.

""There's a simple trick you can try to determine her hearing"" explains the doctor. ""Simply ask her a question at a distance and if she doesn't hear you, move slightly closer and ask again until she does"".

That night, the husband arrives home and sees his wife in the kitchen cooking. He thinks to himself, ""what a perfect opportunity to test her hearing"".

He stands in the doorway of the kitchen and promptly asks;

""What's for dinner honey?""

No answer. He moves closer.

""What's for dinner honey?""

Still no answer. He moves even closer.

""What's for dinner honey?""

Still his wife doesn't answer. He now sees how serious her hearing problem is. At this point, he is stood right next to his wife.

TIFU by accidentally assaulting a child in a public park,"So today was pretty f*cking eventful. 

First, obligatory backstory: My best friend and I often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it's a lot of fun when everyone's enjoying themselves and letting loose. One weekend, my best friend's older brother came home from Croatia ( First time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. He offers me if I want to come but I want them to have quality bro time so I pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.

It just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (We'll call him L) got into a fight with another group of guys. Although he and his bro didn't sustain too much damage from the fight (The other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) L and I got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. It would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.

We caught up and chilled at a local public playground (Keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. Being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we'd deck the other and how we'd essentially easily F*ck the other up. We began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. 

It was just two 18yr olds messing around. 

All of a sudden, I say something stupid in a mock Japanese accent (I'm Asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at L, when this child that couldn't be over 8 jumps in and says ""Hiiyaahh""

I couldn't stop my momentum and proceeded to YEET this kid into the sandpit... 

No amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.

I went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. He wasn't seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. 

His older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. I apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying I talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.

His bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. All in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and I got to kick a child in the face... Win-Win.      (that's a joke)

TL:DR
Best friend and I were pretend fighting in a public park and when I attempted to do a ridiculous kick I saw on UFC, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. Worth it.

Edit: Holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, I am not worthy of this. I made this post at 12am last night and when I woke up, I was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. 

I appreciate you all!

Edit #2: I didn't make one point clear enough regarding the playground. Besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. L and I made sure that our presence wasn't making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn't have even entered the playground area at all.

Hope that kinda clears some shiz up",tifu
Update: Art Cartel,"I posted a while ago about a business in town claiming I was running a cartel.
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7a3xi4/apparently_im_running_an_art_cartel/


I figure I owe a follow up to all the crazy that has happened, even though most of it is social small town drama and not ""legal"".  Still, it's been an insane month.  For ease, I'm just going to refer to both people and places as Gallery A, Gallery B and Gallery C.  (Also I got a lot of guesses as to my shop and town. Also I got a lot of guesses as to where I live. At least one was correct but I'm not going to verify because I don't want John harassed.)

Coming off of the first post I made, John was continuing to make weird statements online.  I had a few people who are friends with him agreeing to take screenshots.  In one, he was petitioning for funds to bring a lawsuit against The Three Banditos.  Someone asked what his proof was that we were hurting his business, and he posted a weird combination of google pictures of our storefronts, an ad for one of our events, and a listing in an old ad for downtown businesses that was printed a year before he went into business.  He also linked to a several year old interview from Gallery A about supporting high school artists.

I had my meeting scheduled with my lawyer on Tuesday Nov 7th, but he called on Monday.  When I answered the phone he joked ""I'm really disappointed in what a terrible art cartel you're running.""  It turns out my lawyer's secretary had been at the coffee shop when John was trying to get money and kept a copy of the list of grievances.  When I arrived for the meeting on Tuesday, my lawyer had a downright sassy letter ready to go for John which told him that any future threats would be taken seriously and then helpfully referred him to the definitions of a cartel.

For a few days, nothing.  Then my lawyer, I and the other galleries all get a copy of John's list of grievances in the mail.  This was the first I read it, but essentially pinpoints me as the head of the art cartel based on the fact that I was the one to sign the contract for the advertising page we took out in the local tourist book.  He also points out we have similar hours of operation we established without consulting him.  (A note about this.  We don't have the exact hours.  We just all are open similar times to the other businesses and restaurants around us because of traffic flow).

He also claims Gallery A is committing fraud as they show original pieces but also sell framed prints of the same work at more reasonable prices.  A new addition was the commentary that I (me, personally) had conspired with an ice cream place near him and told them to reduce their hours for the winter in order to hurt his traffic.  (The fact that they always reduce hours because ice cream doesn't sell in winter apparently wasn't it). There were a few other points, but those were the most bizarre.

My lawyer CC'd me on a letter that can be summed up ""Seriously, knock it off,"" and told him he was banned from my shop.

On Veteran's day, I got a call from the high school art teacher.  She told me that John had called her and told her not to work with local galleries anymore.  He said that if she ceased working with us that he would give her brochures for ""legitimate"" art schools for her students.  When she said she planned to continue working with us, John said that she was leading her students to poor practices.  She contacted me afraid that there would be issue with her students.  I said I didn't foresee any issue, but thanked her for her information.  I said if it escalated, I'd ask her to speak to my lawyer.

A few days later, I get a screenshot of John's Facebook page that has listed ""the Three Banditos are at it again"".  It links to two upcoming events we were advertising for the holiday crowd.  It also included a fantastic photoshop collage of myself, the other gallery owners and a local jeweler, each wearing a black cowboy hat and bandana.  Later that day the jeweler called to jokingly ask me if there was an initiation process to join the Banditos.  We have no idea why he is included, he wasn't part of the promotion John linked.

I found out at this point that John previously attacked a Paint and Sip that's run by a local business on the local tourist Facebook page.  He posted a pic of one of their previous group photos with ""This is not art"" written across it. He pulled it after several people pointed out his high end gallery shouldn't feel threatened by a paint and sip.  But before he did Gallery C responded by posting Magritte's Treachery of Images, which is so funny in so many levels.

Then things escalated again.  On Nov 13th, John posted a pic on Facebook of Gallery B, which is located on a corner, with sidewalks only on one side.  He pointed out that if someone were to take the corner too quickly, they would crash into the building.  Then asked people to do the ""right thing"" and drink and drive around the block a few times.  It turns out Gallery B and John are in the same professional organization, and they look poorly on threats.  Gallery B sent screenshots as well as a copy of John's list of grievances and John was put on probation with the organization pending review.

The next morning, John is outside my shop screaming that he knows what I did and that I have spies.  He didn't enter the premises and left when I threatened to call police, but I did get video of him on my phone.  The same day he removed anyone local from his Facebook.  That afternoon, John apparently went to a local restaurant and hassled the owner for details about what we are doing to ruin his business.  The restaurant eventually threw him out, but up until then the owner hadn't heard any of this, so he called me to ask what the heck this was about.

Nov 16th, I was opening shop when a friend sends me a picture of John in handcuffs.  We rent advertising space at a historic site where local information is kept.  John was found vandalizing our poster, its frame, and the acrylic cover.  He did this during the day when employees were around, no clue how he thought he would get away with it.  He got a fine for his troubles, but it got more gossip out there.  Turns out I wasn't the first threatened with lawsuits in the community.  I passed this onto my lawyer.

The weekend before Thanksgiving, there was a meeting of the group that handles the downtown events, projects etc.  Most shops are fairly active with the group and the meetings are open to the public.  As far as I know John has never attended a meeting until this one.  They were discussing the finalization of Christmas tree lighting and Christmas events when a John asked for time to speak.  He handed out this paper to everyone present which had a summary of his financials at his old, city gallery and a summary of his financials at his new gallery.  Then he apparently said ""I think we all know whose fault it is that theres a difference.  I'm not naming names.""  Then he glared at everyone until they got him to leave the podium.

I was given a copy of this by someone who attended the meeting.  John isn't doing well financially. I turned it over to my lawyer.

The day before Thanksgiving there was a notice posted on the community bulletin board.  It stated that there is a conspiracy in town to put new businesses down.  It then refers to ""certain individuals"" and ""certain unnamed shops"", and has several of the same bullet points as John's list of grievances.  It also says those certain individuals have paid off all local lawyers from representing the person who put up the poster.  This notice was removed from the bulletin board as everything posted there needs prior approval.  Gallery C happened to hear about it and fished it out of the trash.  We turned it over to my lawyer.

I had hoped things would de escalate now that I was downgraded from Bandito to the Nameless One, but no such luck.  That Saturday, the 25th, we hosted an event with refreshments.  The way this works is that we sell admission and you get a wristband and go from participating shops and galleries for food.  John did not participate, as usual.

At some point during the afternoon, two of the participants went into John's shop.  When he saw the wristbands, he went into the back and came out with a scissors.  He told them to be in his gallery, they had to cut the wristbands off.  When they refused, he grabbed at the woman's hand still holding the scissors, and was yelling.  The two left the gallery and reported it to a police officer.  Their next stop was Gallery B, where they told this story.  My lawyer has been unable to get verification for this incident from police.  (This is also, as far as I know, the last time the gallery was open.)

The next day, Sunday, I got a visitor in my shop who was acting weird.  He was asking my employee detailed questions about the business:  where did we get our artwork, what did we pay, how much was rent.  When I overheard this I came over and realized the guy bore a striking resemblance to John, only younger.  Let's call him John Jr.  I introduced myself and he asked me if I had any upcoming promotions.  In response, I handed him a copy of the monthly booklet the town puts out, which has basically everything happening in the area, including our events.  John Jr looked surprised, and asked me where else he could get this booklet.  I gave him a list of places offhand.  He then asked me if everywhere got the same copy.  I said they did and it was also available online.  I was really hestitant that I was giving John information , but figured by only giving easily found public info, I was ok.

John Jr left, but I found out he went to a coffee shop and asked if they had a copy of the booklet and asked a ton of questions about it and my shop.

Gallery C contacted me last Monday to let me know that John had gotten into a heated argument with a man matching John Jr's description on the sidewalk near Gallery C.  John Jr had left and driven away.

By last Wednesday, John had a sign on the door of his gallery stating it would be closed any day there is a planned downtown event listed online.  As there's something happening nearly every day for the holidays, this would mean he will be closed essentially all of December.

The next day, Gallery C got a letter from John.  It told him to stop walking by the front of John's store, and claims to have ""hours of footage"" of him passing by.  He then threatened to sue Gallery C for using the public sidewalk. (Gallery C and John are on the same street and Gallery C needs to use the parking lot past John's store, so he does pass by twice a day.). At this point, Gallery C decided to retain my lawyer.  He was told to cross the street instead of passing directly in front of John's gallery for the time being, but our lawyer also sent a response letter.  Gallery C informed me of this after their meeting.

At this point, I also found out through the grape vine that John had attempted to hire my lawyer some weeks prior in order to sue me, only to be told it would be a conflict of interest.

John responded by sending our lawyer a rambling, multi page letter that had some elements of his list of grievances and other additions.  While it probably was in response to Gallery C, most of it was directed at me, so my lawyer showed it to me.  it was mostly insulting my business and saying I purposefully am putting him out of business.  It also includes that John attempted to get this put in the local newspaper some weeks prior, but they turned him down.  We are trying to get verification of this.  My lawyer basically says if John does anything else, he is bringing the hammer down on him, and sent a letter to this effect.

At dinner, I heard a rumor John is behind on his rent and the landlord is planning evictions after the holidays.  Because his gallery has been closed, I haven't seen John since Thanksgiving weekend.

Gallery B sent a Christmas card with a cropped pic of himself in a black hat and bandana from John's Facebook, framed in a wreath.  He wants us to take a group photo in black cowboy hats and bandanas for next year's local business review.  I'm debating it.",legaladvice

Guy tried to pass me and hit oncoming traffic. Said he'd sue me since I didn't slow down (GA),"EDIT: Finally know everything that has occurred legally. My stepdad has some friends and found out what was reported. After the officer told me I could leave, the drivers of both cars were taken to the hospital and the officer eventually met up with the guy overtaking me once he was stable. Guy told him I sped up and that I was ""mad he was passing me."" Said Officer went back and looked up my license number (whoever said they normally get numbers for everyone was right. I didn't even think he actually got it) and saw that I already had a speeding citation (from a year ago) and considered it reasonable enough to give me the leaving scene of an accident citation. So. The officer stated his reasoning was the discovery of new evidence i.e. my old ticket. 

My parents are furious and we're just waiting for my day in court because there's no evidence I sped up, there's no dash cam footage that's mysteriously came up, there's nothing besides the guy making an illegal pass saying it was my fault. 



Hello! 17 year old here with okay driving history (I have a speeding ticket but I did my time for it). I was on the way to school a few weeks ago and was driving pretty much at the speed limit because it's been rainy for a few weeks and I'm also just still paranoid since my first ticket. Two lane road, solid yellow lines. 

Cue a-hole tailing me and eventually crossing over to pass. I guess he didn't look good enough because he ended up going headfirst into a car in the opposite lane. I swerved out into the grass and my car was fine but the other two were pretty messed up. The first police on scene did ticket him for crossing the solid yellow but the driver was pretty much unconscious anyway. 

I moved on from it since I didn't cause the accident and I went on to school. Yesterday, my stepdad got some papers (my car is registered in his name) from the juvenile court for my county saying I was being faulted for an accident and that this guy's insurance was coming after me. I was so confused because my car wasn't damaged, I don't need this on my driving record, and so on. My stepdad went through the papers and it seems like the original driver is trying to say it was my fault he hit someone because I was supposed to slow down when I saw him passing. 

I have absolutely no idea what to do here. Is this a situation where I can tell him to pound sand or should I take it seriously? 

Edit: My stepdad called juvie court today and asked what I was charged with and he was told that the officer on scene I spoke to (I told him exactly what happened - guy passed me and hit someone. He asked to see my license. I didn't see why not. He basically said ""Thanks for reporting I'll contact you if I need anything else have a good day"") is citing me for leaving the scene of an accident. And the reason he let me go then was because he ""didn't know I could've prevented the accident until further investigation.""

We're even more confused and my parents went to the insurance people today and they said no one has contacted them but they made copies of all the paperwork and that we'd all just have to wait. I'm guessing other driver got my license plate number and told him I sped up or something. I don't know what to do here because if this sticks, I lose my license until I turn 21 (stipulation of my first ticket). ",legaladvice
TIFU by knocking out the guy I'm seeing,"This actually happened yesterday but I couldn't get a chance to post it.  

I'm a pretty ""basic"" white girl. I'm 21, I like Starbucks, I wear leather leggings and hoodies, I'm blonde, I have a part time job as a secretary-- so it was not surprising that the guy I'm sorta dating didn't believe me when I told him I've been kickboxing for the better part of a decade. Instead of going to the gym and jogging, kickboxing has been a way for me to be active and stay fit. It kinda pissed me off he thought I'm making it up to look cool in front of him because he's been trying to get into kickboxing-- so I figured, why not have like a fun date at the gym he's been going and kick the heavy bags and have fun.  

He kinda laughed at the idea but I made him accept.  

We got to the gym, I met his gym friends, his coach and so far it was going good. The dumbass jokingly said we should spar and that he'd go easy on me-- told me with sparring gear it wouldn't hurt and it'd be fun. There was no way I'm saying no to that. My plan was show him that experience matters and make him believe me that I've really been doing this for a looooooong time-- but no, the asshole didn't put on any protective gear. I got mad.  

We begin. He's laughing, his friends are laughing and cheering for me like I'm some kid-- and I'm just getting more and more pissed off by the minute. The cheering was the boiling point. As soon as my date got close enough, out of nowhere I decided to head kick him with everything I had. I literally grunted as I kicked him. In the ten or so years I've been kickboxing I don't think I've EVER kicked anyone that hard. He was out cold before he even hit the ground. 

Needless to say, when he came to his senses he had no choice but to accept that I've actually been kickboxing for quite some time-- I also invited him over at my place tonight and plan to make him dinner to apologize for the KO.  

Surprisingly, he doesn't hate me and laughed it off-- and accepted the dinner invite which is a win in my book. 

tl;dr: My date didn't believe me I've been kickboxing for quite a long time and asked me to spar. I head kicked him and knocked him out cold.

TIFU by having my son clean his room.,"To start off this is my wife's story and  it happened at the beginning of the year. 

Some back story we have 2 kids a 10 year old and a 2 year old. Why 8 years apart well me and the mrs tried having a kid for 7 years before she became pregnant.  So the 10 year old helps out a lot and is a great kid. We are truly lucky to have this child. 

Well at the beginning of the year the two year old had started to potty train him self. Telling us he had to go potty and then going potty. So we get him some pull ups and start that phase. We also have a 3 bedroom home and the boys share a room (the 10 year olds idea not mine). 

Cue the day of said FU. The 2 year old had been playing in their room just out of ear shot of the wife. She would check on him every few minutes just to make sure he was all right. Well he comes to her and says (we think) mommie slim yucky. 

Oh no my wife thinks and calls for the oldest. Hey, oldest the 2 year old got into your slime can you clean It up for me while I make lunch. So the oldest goes into the room to clean it up and my wife picks up the two tear old to clean him up. It's at this time she sees the 2 year old doesn't have his pull up on, and after a few minutes my oldest calls out, ""Mom! Can slime go bad?"" She walks into the room to she my 10 year old trying to clean up a huge pile of runny poo that is all over the floor with his bare hands. 

So after a few screams and laughs from my wife she tells him to go take a hot shower and she cleans the mess her self. Then let's him play on the switch for the rest of the day. 

Tldr: 10 year old tries to clean up runny poo with hands thinking it was slime.

Edit. Holy shit ( no pun intended) this blew up. You guys have me in tears laughing on my lunch break. Thanks so much. 

But to answer a question or statement I have gotten in dms. No my oldest doesn't baby sit but does help out around the house. Keeping his toys picked up and out of reach of the little one. Normally he does a great job. Is just one of said responsibilities.

Edit #2 got gold? Thanks it means a lot. You guys have made my day. 

Also my wife and kids did this DIY slime thing and at one part you add food coloring to make it the color you want. My son made his brown. Cause he added multiple colors. So when the little one runs in saying slime yucky it wasn't a weird thing and he has gotten into it  before. My oldest wasn't playing in it. He was trying to clean it up.  And the whole thing was over the span of a few minutes. So he wasn't in there for that long trying to clean it up. 

And I forget not everyone knows things. But if you google Slime it should clear up confusion.",tifu
"[US, OK] Disgruntled neighbor has installed a strobe light to stop epileptic kids from using a school bus stop.","To give some context on where we live: we're in a small neighborhood of about 5 homes; it's a very small cul-de-sac area in the middle of farmland. There aren't other homes or buildings for about 2 miles.

I have 3, young, elementary aged children that all have a very serious case of epilepsy: it does not take much to cause an episode. By some luck, two of our neighbor's kids also have epilepsy, and are also around the same age as our kids. For the past few years they have been able to successfully group together and go to the end of our community to catch the bus.

The family who used to own the house at the street recently moved out, and there is a new owner who has been an absolute hell to everyone. From the second day on, he has harassed our kids telling them to get off his property, even though they were technically on a public road. Through the grapevine he somehow learned that a majority of the kids were epileptic, and has installed strobe lights in his front lawn. These are VERY powerful, VERY fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

We've contacted the police, and they won't even come out to talk to the guy. We've contacted the school to see if they could come into the neighborhood to pick up our kids, and they really can't: the bus just couldn't drive into our neighborhood and easily back out. They have to be picked up on the street.

What can we do?

AITA forbidding my wife from using my daughters old room,"This has been an ongoing argument between my wife and I, but it resulted in a huge argument today and I'm starting to wonder if I'm in the wrong. I think it's impossible for someone in my position to see my wife's point of view fairly so tell me who's the asshole here. I'm also not interested in any relationship advice, our marriage is fine, it's solely this topic/argument that I'm interested in hearing your judgement on.

So my wife and I have two kids together. But before I met my wife I had a daughter with my now ex-wife. My daughter passed away when she was 7, and the emotional toll of this destroyed my marriage with my ex-wife. We haven't said a word to each other in almost a decade and I have no desire to speak with her anyway.

I still own the same house as then and I've pretty much left my daughters room as it was. At first it was just because there was no reason to, but now it's kind of like a memorial in some weird sense? I can't really explain the logic behind it because I don't think there is any. It just doesn't feel right to change her room.

This has been the cause of the only arguments my wife and I have really had. The house has four bedrooms, so each of our kids have a room, we have a shared room, and then there's my daughters old room. My kids know not to go in there and it's just left there. Occasionally I will go in there and read a book, or just lie down on her bed. It's therapeutic in some weird way.

My wife has always wanted to change the room. At first it was because she wanted a study, but I refused and eventually she gave up. 

We're now talking about having a third child and naturally she wants our new kid to have my daughters old room. Again I put my foot down and said that wasn't an option, and that our two older kids can share a room instead.

 She really blew up at me and told me she was sick of me holding on to the past. She was sick of me being unable to compromise on this. She was sick of feeling like my deceased daughter came first. She said a lot of things but I think that basically sums it up.

When she said these things I was really hurt. But I've had a few hours to think it over, and I think I might be the unreasonable asshole here. It's not fair to make my kids share a room because I won't let go of the past. It's not fair to have a memorial reminds my wife that she wasn't my first love.

AITA for taking back the birthday gift I gave my sister?,"So, i'm 24M. My little sister is 14 and has always been interested in art. I moved an hour and a half away when I was 18 and we 
don't see eachother often, but I make a point to call/text


It was her birthday yesterday and I thought I'd splurge since she's been going through a rough time. She's changed schools twice due to bullying and our mom always tells me that she won't talk to anyone, is having intense mood swings, etc. I've made multiple attempts to help her, but she shuts me down and gets snippy.



Anyway, I got her a set of 150$ artist grade markers called Copics. I'm no art connoisseur, but apparently every artist who's anybody has them and our parents don't wanna spend that kind of money for her hobby (they're about 5$ PER MARKER) and tend to give practical gifts like clothes. Whenever we've texted recently it's been her ranting about them not getting them for her.

even on her birthday she was like a bomb about to go off. She barely acknowledged me and only said hello when she was asked. I was excited to give her the gift but the second I opened it she grabbed them and turned to our mom, saying ""See! Even he knows you should've got them for me!"" Which I awkwardly brushed off. Everytime she opened a gift from our parents it was very snotty like ""Oh, yayyyy, cheap sneakers, my favorite."" ""A plaid skirt. WOW. I'm blessed."" 


I was prepared for an angsty teen, but I soon reached my limit. Our dad showed her a journal they bought and she suddenly yelled ""I told you both exactly what I wanted but you spent the same amount of money on shit I don't need! Fuck this!"" she threw it against the wall and ran up to her room.



Our parents were a lot less well-off when I was her age, and they could barely afford a birthday for me. Everytime it was a dodgy cake and a handful of clothes without holes in them, I accepted them like I was the luckiest kid ever. I would've never swore and yelled but she's been very spoiled.


I talked with them for awhile and apparently shes done worse before which shocks me. They think even if they can afford it now, she should learn the value of a dollar. I agree helped shape me to not have my every whim be attended to. Besides, she got what she wanted in the end, why is she still mad in the first place?


Sister came back to get the markers, but I took them back. I said that she was ungrateful and I wouldn't tolerate it. She started screaming at me but I just left the ""party"" prematurely with the gift in tow.



My whole family is blowing up my phone because I ""ruined her birthday"". In my eyes, I spent 150$ to get no thank-you and yelled at. This will teach her a valuable lesson and maybe spark a change in her teen angst phase. But my family doesn't want to hear from me until I give it back. Considering I've got my entire family shitting on me, I have to wonder if I did make the wrong choice. So, reddit, AITA?",AmItheAsshole

My(M36) wife (F43) thinks I couldn't be attracted to her and therapist agreed?,"Background:

Married a little over two years, after dating a very short time around 3 months. 

We meet at a work event and I was immediately smitten with my wife. It was like out of a movie I saw her chatting with a group of people and in my head I heard ""oh there she is"". She was newly devorced and took some convincing on my part but we have been together from that night on and get along extremely well.

Now for clarity I am extreamly attracted to my wife, we may just still be in the honeymoon stage but I've never felt this way about another women. And becasue it's pertains to the conversation we had today with her therapist I would say the majority of the population would find her attractive and not in a niche way. She is objectively attractive. I feel we are evenly matched in looks, very few people have notice the slight age difference. She however wins in personality (outgoing and charming) and she makes about 3X as much money as I do. 

A couple months ago we ran into an ex of mine, and by ex we literally dated for maybe a month and never exclusive. After my wife mentioned how different they were (age/hair color/body type etc) and it ended in a pretty heated argument. We have had 3/4 conversations since, all of which I was trying to convince my wife I'm not going to leave her for a women I ""dated"" years ago. 

Last week she asked if I would go to her therapist with her today and I agreed. She has been seeing her for about 8 years for anxiety and a bout of depression that happed before we meet.

Today:

Started normal enough and I had figured why we were there so I just jumped into it thinking the therapist would be on my side and would help me calm my wife's fears. That's not what happed.

The therapist did very little talking although their long silences and knowing glances started to piss me off right away.

The thing that stood out to me the most was how my wife reiterated how she doesn't see how I would be attracted to her and the therapist didn't even disagree. Like I felt like a crazy person, my wife is beautiful, charming, funny, it feels like I wished her into existence.

She brought up the age difference (7 years?!?), my looks, and how quickly I wanted to get married as all reasons for why I am basically a gold digger. 

First off we both wanted to get married quickly, I asked and figured she would want a long engagement but she didn't so we got married. Second I never even discussed money with her until after we were married and never dreamed she made so much more than I do. She said she doesn't think I'm after her money but enjoy the lifestyle while I'm with her and it makes it easier to pretend I'm attracted to her. Sorry more attracted to her, like I play it up. 

I'm completely blind sided and don't really want to talk to my family or friends, it's humiliating being accused of marrying someone for a lifestyle.

For clarity: I moved into her house, I rent out my old home but that income just covers the mortgage and the company that manages it. All our money goes into a joint checking with automatic transfers into savings etc. Our bills are paid from that account, I looked at our bank account and I spend significantly less than she does each month on average. 

After leaving I'm in a complete panic that she is going to leave me, even though I feel humiliated and love her so much. I immediately wanted to offer to sign a prenup or separate bank accounts or both but I just froze.

My wife seem so sad and I'm so frustrated, I didn't even do anything wrong. The women I've dated in my past don't have a similar type and to be honest I didn't really date, more like hook up for a few months then moved on. I love my wife, she is the first women I have ever met that I have had a real partnership with, like we were a team and now that's all gone. 

I don't feel like I have the strength to leave her, it scares me that I can't even envision a scenario where I would leave. She is my most favorite person.

How do I rebuild trust when I don't feel I ever did anything to lose it. 


Edit: My wife didn't come home last night but I texted her this morning. First apologizing for leaving the session and then asking her to come home so we could formulate a plan. No word back yet but I doubt she will check her phone before lunch if she went to work. 

Thanks for letting me vent, I've already asked my insurance company to send a list of counselors for me to call later today. Hopefully I will find a good fit as I don't even know how to go about picking one.

Edit 2: I need a referral from my general doctor before insurance will cover a therapist/psychologist, I have an emergency phone appointment Monday and will being seeing someone by myself.

My wife didn't return my text but did come home about an hour later. Honestly I cried for the first time in a long time, but was able to get across how seriously I take her concerns. I haven't mentioned anything about her therapist or my feelings about things just apologized and asked for another chance to hear her out completely.

She said she was really drained and is taking a nap, I don't think she made it in to work and am actually looking forward to having the weekend to talk. I'm not going to ask for couples counseling until I talk to my own therapist. 

This is probably it unless I fuck things up this weekend. Thanks for letting me type out my feelings and being honest even the hard comments were helpful.",relationship_advice
UPDATE: I [24F] am dating a [25M] almost unreasonably picky eater and I'm pretty much at the end of my rope,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3ev1n/i_24f_am_dating_a_25m_an_almost_unreasonably/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

This happened last night.

&#x200B;

This update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than I had hoped but it is what it is. I read what you all wrote and I appreciate all the comments left for me. Despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that I'm not being nit picky about this issue. 

I decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. He needed help and so long as I saw that he was trying that was all I asked for. We were out to dinner (I'm sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to Germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his ""streak going."" I was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but I figured now was as good a time as any: 

Me: Maybe you don't have to continue to the streak. Maybe you can just try new German cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. Have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

J: No way. I have people depending on me to continue this streak. I don't want to let them down.

Me: I don't think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, I'm worried about you. This is really unhealthy and it's consuming your life. You're about to go on this incredible trip to Germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. I think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

We had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. He doesn't think it's a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he's only 25) and how I was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. I let him know how this IS my business because it affects me. We can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

We let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. The plan after was to go back to his place where I would spend the night. The entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while I wished I had just gone home. I should have gone home. I guess I didn't expect the shitstorm that waited when I got to his place.

He flipped.

He began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how I couldn't control what he did or ate. I told him I cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. I ultimately agreed that he was right, I couldn't control what he did or what he ate, but he can't expect that I stick around and watch and enable him like I had been doing in the past. 

It escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when I was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. I could not and still cannot dispute that. He was. I guess the only difference between him and I is that I wanted to change. I acknowledged the issue and knew I could not go on like this any longer. Obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. One spirals much faster than the other so I was able to recognize it much quicker. 

I told him I was going to leave because I couldn't deal with this anymore. We kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would ""expose"" me. He has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. He would be sharing it on facebook. I completely panicked. I cried and begged that he didn't use my most vulnerable moments against me. He told me if I walked out he absolutely would. 

That was all I needed to hear. He was going to blackmail me. I think this snapped me awake to realize this isn't love. If I leave he's going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

So I left. I don't have many possessions there but he can keep them for all I care. He emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was ""last chance.""

Let him post it. Fuck it. I can't control other people I can only control myself and how I react. I deactivated all my social media and I'm ready to move on with my life. It hurts that somebody I trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it's a learning lesson. Thank you all for reading.

EDIT: I'm a total hot head and need to relax. Crazy defensive right now and wondering if I did the right thing. I apologize for lashing out.",relationship_advice

Accused rapists should have the same anonymity as rape victims until proven guilty.,"With the difficulty in proving rape cases due to evidence being largely testimonial, many accused rapists are judged in the public eye rather than the courts. As the basis of the law is innocent until proven guilty and lived can be ruined based upon false accusations, defendants should remain nameless unless it's in the public interest. 

Naming accused brings few benefits besides other victims/witnesses potentially coming forward and warning the public while the trial is under way. Obviously due to the nature of the crime, each cases is different and exceptions will apply. However with many details of trials hidden, the general public tends to make their decision if the accused is guilty based upon very little evidence. This can essentially amount to mob rule even if they are eventually proven innocent, reputations can be irreparable. ",unpopularopinion
Police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while I was asleep,"This has been a really weird morning... not sure if I chose the correct flair

I have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. He sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). Lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. I put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. Around 3am I got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. She gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

At 6:30am I am awoken by a single low knocking sound. I get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point I usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more Z's). As I exit my room I am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. I dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if I should serve them a drink. One cop asks me who I am to which I reply with my full name and ask what is going on. He continues his interrogation, asking If I live with a woman. Fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. I answer that I live with my girlfriend. The cop asks me if I have a son to which I reply yes. He asks me where he is. At this point I lean over the wall and I see my door busted upen. I am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so I look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. I see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" The tell me to step out into the dining room and I put my hands up as I walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. I sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. I look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex I live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 The cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. He says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. He claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. They never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. My apartment has weird acoustics and I cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

He asks me why I didnt hear him and I told him I must have been deeply asleep. He asks if I am under the influence of drugs and I say I just went to bed late because I was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. As the cops leave I could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. The cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. I asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. I asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

So now I am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. I fear when I go outside I'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

I have been trying to understand the timeline of events. I went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. If the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. My son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. The cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" NOT a crying child. My son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

Is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? What about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? Was that just an excuse to burst in? He sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

I think my 3 year old is being sexually abused at daycare [x-post from /r/parenting],"Originally posted in /r/parenting, but it was suggested I post here... Edit per bot request: we are in California.

My son has been in the same church run daycare/preschool for about a year. At the time, we didn't love the place, but we were desperate because I needed to go back to work and it was the only place that would work with my part time schedule. (We didn't love it because it didn't seem as academic as others, but he was only two so we let it go).

He seems to really like it there. Most days he doesn't even say goodbye to me, he just runs into which ever room they have setup and starts playing. He seems to like some kids and teachers more than others, but that seems normal enough. He occasionally has rough/clingy mornings, but they are pretty rare and seem to correlate with story time on Fridays, but not every Friday.

I'm not sure if some of his new behaviors are unusual or just par for the course for a toddler/threenager. He never used to mind diaper changes, but started kicking and screaming during them sometimes after he started at the daycare. He's always been a strong willed kid, but screaming ""I don't want to"" and ""put me down"" are things he picked up at daycare for whatever reason. I thought it was odd that the church pastor would be reading to the kids sometimes when I dropped my kid off on Fridays, and even weirder that he sometimes had kids in his lap, but the teachers were always there and it was always a group activity.

We had some concerns, but nothing concrete and more that he was learning to hit/push than anything worse. Until today. We finish up dinner and I get the bath ready for our 1 year old, leaving the 3 year old at the dinner table with my husband. I'm minding my business, bathing the baby when my husband comes into the bathroom to relay something the 3 year old just did and said. It should be noted that our toddler doesn't yet speak in complete sentences or fully respond when   asked questions (ex ""what did you do at school today?"" gets no answer while ""did you paint at school today?"" garners an appropriate ""yep!"" or ""nope!""). Our toddler had finished his dinner and, after we had cleaned up his plate, he asked for peanut butter pretzels, one of his favorite snacks. Normally, we'd say no, but he'd been a good kid all day so my husband said ""sure! But cheek kiss first"" and leaned into our normally very affectionate kiddo. Our son slapped my husband across the face and said ""no! Pretzels now!"". Not great, but not out of the ordinary for him after a long day (we don't hit our kids, but he definitely struggles with hitting when he's frustrated). He did/said this twice and then said ""get candy!"". My husband said ""no candy right now"" and then asked ""do you get candy at school?"" Our son then grabbed two of my husband's fingers, rubbed the tips with his fingers several times, said ""it's round, it's round"" and then licked them repeatedly. He did this several times. (Just typing this is making me nauseous again). My husband asked if that's how he got candy and our son repeated the behavior/motion and then put his finger to his lips and said ""shhhh!"", then put his other pointer finger to my husband's lips and said ""shhhh!"" (We only ever use ""shhh"" to comfort them when crying and have never put our fingers to his or our lips). My husband tried to gently ask more questions, but our son just mumbled nonsense and then asked to get out of his highchair.

My husband came and told me immediately and we got the baby out of the tub, and tried to talk to the toddler again, but he'd moved on and just wanted to go sit on the couch. We didn't know what to do (this was around 730pm), so we called local PD dispatch and they sent over an officer who just told us to speak to the director of the school.

I've tried searching this sub and others and have come across a few sort of related posts, but I have no idea what to do. Local resources open in the morning, and we have already told our workplaces that we won't be in tomorrow due to a family emergency, but we don't know where to start. I can't in good conscience send him back there again.

Are we overreacting? Do we just confront the director? How do we handle this? I obviously don't know what or who exactly, but this definitely seems off. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.


Edit:

First, thanks to everyone for their supportive messages and comments and for taking the time to reply. We are truly blown away by your kindness and thoughtful words. We are also very grateful for all of the advice.

Second, an update. Our son didn't go to the school today and will not return in the future. We didn't contact the school and we don't plan to at all. We'll be out our deposit, but it's worth it at this point. I have another center that we will be touring next week, but we are also prepared for me to stay home with the kiddos for awhile.

This morning my husband called CPS and they said they only handle situations where the abuser is in the home. Next, he called the state licensing board and filed a complaint. The school has an otherwise squeaky clean record, but we were assured they would be opening up an investigation and interviewing every employee at the school. Finally, we called and then visited the local family advocacy center (basically relevant charities, social workers, law enforcement, etc under one roof). We met with a social worker and recounted the same points as above. When she was done taking notes, she called one of the onsite detectives who confirmed that without actual evidence (ie a verbal description of something from our son or physical evidence), there was nothing he could do. Without the cops getting involved, we will not be referred to a forensic psychologist or have the situation otherwise escalated.¬† As frustrating as that is, we are almost fortunate in a way that that type of evidence doesn't seem to exist (or that we stepped in before it did).¬†As many of you said, both the detective and the social worker agreed that the cop that came by yesterday handled it very poorly, but that there was nothing they could do about that either. The¬†social worker mentioned that our son seemed to be a happy kid, not the withdrawn or angry type she's seen in more serious situations. We were referred to a center that specializes in play based therapy that we will be following up with as well. If anything comes out during those sessions, the situation will be handed over to the authorities at that time.¬†

I think that covers everything that happened today. My husband had to go back to work so I've been at home on the couch cuddling my kiddos. If there are any developments, I'll update again, but that is it for now.

A pigeon just laid an egg on my fucking bed and is always coming inside my room.,"So really quick background on this, I live in my apartment in an 11th-floor room and hence we have rooms with a small balcony on the corner. So there are this two pigeons (a couple I assume) and they are always sneaking into my room and then sits on the bed. I thought they were like dumb and would scatter them away. So some days later, I found a twig in my bed. AND then is when I realized that these birds want to fucking make a nest in my bed. So I then threw away the stick and shut the windows and the balcony to restrict them.

So things were kinda okay but then after coming home, I found that I forgot to close the windows and one of them came inside and is comfortably sitting on my bed. And also my bed was like full of clothes, 'cause I was too lazy to sort them out. I scared the pigeon away, but then I found an egg in my bed. IT FUCKING LAID AN EGG. Why are these birds so dumbasses? Man, also I live in an area with nature and trees around it and out of all those wonderful places, you had to pick my bed. I didn't throw the egg away or anything, that was morally wrong as I thought.  So I put out a pan with a rag on top of it and the placed the egg on it and kept it in the balcony.  But the bird is NOT coming to it and is again trying to sneak in the room. I placed the egg literally next to their sight and still, the mama bird ain't even sitting on top of it? So what am I gonna do? Will the egg not hatch if this goes on?

So is there any problem that if I touch the egg, the birb won't accept it or shit?

&#x200B;

EDIT; These things happened in a span of three weeks btw, so it first came to my room in the first week, I found a twig during the second week, and the egg in the end of the third week (just yesterday)

EDIT #3:[So these are the pics](https://imgur.com/a/TqS2Mdi). And sorry for the quality and if the bird looks like a monster preparing to shoot lasers at me, I had to use flash.

***EDIT*** \#4: Idk if anyone is here, but the bird laid two eggs as expected. So when I found the bird and the egg on my bed, I think it was gonna lay another egg but I scattered it away. And quick facts on pigeons on the way;

* Sometimes the mama and the papa bird may share the time sitting on the eggs
* Most often they egg two eggs, but not simultaneously (yeah I thought they laid two at the same time)
* And as u/Kelekona said, they mostly nest in cliffs most often, so I'm guessing the apartment looked like a cliff to it? Man these birbs",NoStupidQuestions
TIFU by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think I was a heroin junkie,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved to fiddle around with staplers. Playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. One of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. Running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. There are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes I'd break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. I've even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200B;

This progressed from me messing around with staples in Ms. Grady's second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. I had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? Well...

&#x200B;

Fast forward to present day. I am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. I have a home, a normal car, an office job. I am by all accounts a normal human being... **I still love staples.** Working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. I'd spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. It got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200B;

So I had to stop doing that...I turned to Amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. It wasn't enough. I went to 20, then 40. My wife got curious then and asked ""why are you buying all of these boxes of staples"". But I brushed it off as a work issue that I'd get reimbursed for and knew I had to change my methods.

&#x200B;

Over the course of a few months I enabled myself...I started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. I would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. I began to stay out late and tell my wife I would be home soon, so I could go buy more staples from different stores. I opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn't know but she caught it in the mail. She got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200B;

This past Thursday after one of my ""late nights"" I get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. I walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. Because it is.

&#x200B;

My wife asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. I sat down and kept saying ""what are you talking about"" until my mom said ""honey, we saw the pictures"". Then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. This man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me ""do something"" with what I had in the bag from multiple stores. It basically looked like I was a drug runner for Office Depot who was using some of the product for myself. At this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. I had to come clean and all I could muster was

&#x200B;

""I...I like staples.""

&#x200B;

The WTF looks I got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when I showed them my car....I came clean. I backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. Right now my only concern is my dad. He didn't laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200B;

Believe it or not, I think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. I may or may not do that, but the good news is I now can have a ""staple hour"" once I get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200B;

TLDR: I have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought I was on drugs when it became a problem.

EDIT: 

Thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! I am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. If you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, I just ask that you DM me/name the throwaway so I can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people's perspectives on my problem.

1. I went to see a therapist today with my wife. I was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, I do need help. I am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. Just tailored to my specific issue.

2. Apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. That included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. So after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. My wife initially thought I was having an affair. She didn't think I was doing drugs until she got the pictures. The PI just told her what he saw, and she deduced that I had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. She admitted that she didn't think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. I do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. I am just an addict, and an idiot. I know how stupid the addiction is and so I tried to hide it. It's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things I guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",tifu

AITA for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last name?,"My teacher doesn't like my first name and always talks about how weird it is, and how my last name should be my first. So she took it upon herself to only refer to me by my last name, on tests she'd even cross out my first name when I wrote it. I kept telling her I preferred being called by my first name, but she laughed it off. So I started calling her by her first name, the first time she was shocked but after a month she just kept yelling to me how I was being really disrespectful. I've gotten numerous detentions because of it, but I don't want to stop until she calls me my first name. So AITA if I keep calling her by her first name.

"AITA for not allowing my niece to use ""promised"" money from my grandma's estate to go to college? My family is derisively calling me ""Scott's Tots"" in order to get me to bend and give in, and it's sort of working.","Edit: for all the people asking, Scott's Tots is an episode of the The Office, the plot is Michael made a promise to a group of grade schoolers that he'd pay for thier college. He assumed he'd be a multi millionaire in 10 years when it came time to pay off. The episode centers around him telling the now graduating kids he can't pay for college. I've seen it called the ""best unwatchable episode of TV ever"" because it's so cringe worthy. I've watched the office 8 times and I skip this episode, it's so painful to watch. Parks n' Rec is a better show though...fight me. 

So how do I begin with this. I am 26 and shortly before my grandma died last year she changed me to the executor of her estate. My grandma became enraged (rightly or wrongly) at my mom, aunts and uncle and basically at the 11th hour rewrote her considerable estate go to my generation (myself, sister and cousins) and one great grandkid (who I call niece because I truly don't understand all the ""removed"" stuff) so split evenly 6 ways. The condition was if the person was not through college, their share had to be spent on education first, otherwise I would keep it in a trust until they turned 27. The stipulation was as well that the person had to have a 3.5 gpa to get it for school, if not they had to get their grades up or wait until 27 (I really hope this is making sense). Basically under no circumstances do any of the cousins or great grand kid not get their money or do I get to keep it long term. 

My cousin and her daughter (niece to me) came asking me for the money so she can make payments to University of Arizona so she can start next week. Either they didn't know or didn't care about the GPA requirement because when I asked to see her report card from her last semester it showed me she all but failed her last semester. I don't even know how she graduated because she had something like a 1.2 GPA. I asked her how she got into UofA and she said she didn't really know or care, she just was ready to get to school to party. 

I basically said no, that this was not even remotely the stipulations of my Grandma's will and that I will be happy to give her the money for the spring semester if she gets her grades up to a 3.5 this fall.  

That's when all hell broke loose. My mom, aunts and uncle already see me as a target because they are resentful of being written out of the will. My sister and one cousin are fine because they've already gotten their share but my other 2 cousins and niece have started circulating emails that I'm running my own version of ""Scott's Tots"" because I taking away money that was promised for education. There's also an undertone that I'm keeping the other 3 peoples money so I can save it for myself if they don't go to college. 

No amount of explanation is helping. I've tried to tell them that under no circumstances can I keep their shares. IF they don't go to school, they get the money when they turn 27, no questions asked. No one wants to hear this from me and everyone wants me to give my niece the money independent of her grades (and I imagine my other two cousins will see this as precedent so they get their money well before they turn 27). 

There is really nothing stopping me from doing it. I write all the checks from the trust and while it may not be in line with the will, no one is really going to question what I'm doing. 

I have to admit all the pressure is getting to me, especially the Scott's Tots thing because I don't want to be seen like that. 

Would I be the asshole if I withhold my niece's money for school until she gets her grades up?

"AITA for not letting my wife have mothers day after she ""canceled"" fathers day?","So, this is a little strange of a situation but hear me out.

&#x200B;

I've been married to my wife for almost 7 years now and we have 2 children, one 6 and the other 4. I love her but she is a bit strange sometimes. She is very heavy anti-corporation/government (you know the type.  I will give her credit and say she's very moderate with these views though and not crazy). One of her big beliefs though is with holidays. She still celebrates holidays with the family (Christmas, Easter, etc) but likes to keep them minimalist and not embrace the ""Money"" side of things. We're not monsters though, we still buy our kids stuff for Christmas and for their birthdays but we've tried to make them know this is now what these days should be about and that generosity, not materials, should be what we thing about.

Last year in June my wife told me she doesn't want to celebrate fathers day. Her reasoning was simple, she wanted our children to respect us everyday and not make one day a special occasion for celebrating fathers or mothers. I was a little hesitant but I agreed and we took the day to try to teach them that.

Well, now that mothers day is coming around she's changing her tune. All of the sudden she wants me and the kids to take her out for breakfast, buy her gifts, and do other things for her. I obviously told her no, that we didn't celebrate fathers day and this was her idea to begin with. All of the sudden she got super upset and is claiming i'm the asshole here. She's now saying we should celebrate both days and that it's unfair to her that we aren't celebrating mothers day. We fought about this last night and she's still mad about it.

I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.

A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).

She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.

They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

She's amazing, man. Seriously.


Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said ""How Jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

My GF didn't find it funny...

Anyway, that's it.


Good luck to everyone in their lives.

TIFU by Smeagoling at my new job,"This happened today. About 20 minutes ago, to be more precise.

I just started a new job about a month ago. It's a quiet office environment. I only really know the people immediately around me, but everyone's been super nice to me so far.

One of the things I love about this place is they have a bunch of free breakfast stuff in the break room. This morning I thought a bagel sounded nice so I went to go toast one up. This is where the FU begins. 

I separated the bagel into two halves and went to put it in the toaster. I've only ever owned peasant toasters, but this stainless-steel bad boy had all the bells and whistles, including a ""bagel"" setting. I figured it wouldn't hurt so I punched it and waited. 

While I stood there my mind began to drift. I started thinking about Lord of the Rings for some reason, specifically trying to figure out when my kids would be old enough for me to introduce them to it. I heard the door to the break room shut and assumed the only person who had been in there with me had just left.

Then the toaster dinged and my bagel popped up. I took it out and was struck by how amazingly it had toasted. Warm and soft on the outside, toasted perfection on the inside. I started spreading the butter, still admiring the flawless bagel in my hands. My brain was still in fantasy mode though, and I said to myself in full-on Smeagol voice, ""Oooh yes! We likes it! Gives it to us golden and crispy!""

At this point, my rational brain kicked back in and I realized how fucking weird I can be sometimes. Oh well, no big deal. I take my bagel and turn around, nearly running into a group of ladies looking at me like I just arrived from another planet. I tried to give a polite smile, but I'm sure the surprise and wave of awkwardness I was experiencing made that creepy too. I shuffled past them and am now hiding at my desk. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before ""the new guy"" is rebranded as ""the multiple personality weirdo who talks to himself."" Shit.

TIFU by bodyslamming a girl who wanted to hug me.,"I was in a new high school with absolutely no friends whatsoever and because I was very socially awkward I tried to avoid any direct confrontations with any individual whatsoever so I never really made any friends.

However in my fourth block there was this girl who I just seemed to have clicked with because out of all the students in the entire building she was the only one I really actually talked to. Skip a couple of weeks I'm coming into my class when she decides to greet me with a friendly hug. 

In this moment I was completely frozen because I never really physically interact with anyone, especially females. So in this moment, I go full brain dead and as she's approaching me with open arms I decided I was going to try and be funny and pick her up from her waist and throw her over my shoulder (don't ask why I thought this would be funny, because I honestly have no clue what the fuck I was thinking) but the second she sees me go down and try and pick her up I could just see the complete and udder confusion in her face as she was just simply wanting a quick hug, but as I pick her up just to make things ten times worse, I shout,

""WWE Supah Slammmm!!"" 

And she's screaming and for some reason my heart just dropped realizing what I was doing and instead of lightly setting her down, I just fucking drop her and she slams right into a cluster of desks making this massive crashing sound in the middle of the room. I went to ask her if she was okay but she started crying her eyes out basically asking me what the fuck was wrong with me.

TL;DR I shouldn't be allowed around people.",tifu
TIFU by accidentally dosing myself with LSD at work.,"Throwaway.  Well it was around noon when I ate my pasta.  Shortly after that I found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  I initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee I shouldn't have had.  At 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which I always use for some gym time.  As I was walking out of the office I realized that this wasn't just the caffeine talking.  The possibility that I was in fact, tripping, didn't even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  Somehow.  Life finds a way.  Saturday morning I had prepared some 'gummy bears' for my friends using the translucent Tupperware lid as the backdrop. Some of the residue must have lived through the night.  On Sunday I made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the Tupperware.  I put the lid on and didn't think twice about it.  Today I ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  Or maybe I laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  I'm honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since I microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it's my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. It did though and by the time I had walked to the gym I knew damn well what was coming my way.   Well anyway, I went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  The work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, I started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when I didn't know where I was going, or why.  I pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before I had to take the plunge.  I did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  I cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. My behavior was normal except for when I forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  We had a new team-member start today and I had to give her a tour.   I don't think she could tell I was fucked up but I know I was sweating a lot and rambling.  I now have another 50 minutes before I very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  What a fucking Monday.

TL;DR: Accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending I was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office.",tifu
[NC] My dog went missing a month ago and i found her on Facebook. The family that has her refuses to return her to me. What can I do?,"So a little over a month ago my purebred yellow lab went missing from my backyard. At first I thought she might have escaped but after looking around it turned out someone broke into my backyard and took her. I made a police report but nothing ever came of it and she didn't turn up anywhere.

Last week though a friend who lives over four hours away from me sent me fliers that were put up for a found dog. It was my dog. I should mention here that my lab stands out due to the fact that she got into an accident as a pup that she lost her left eye in and tore here left ear up pretty bad.

I called the number on the flier yesterday and got into contact with a woman well call stacy. I told stacy that she had my dog and after a 20 minute conversation I all but confirmed it. Here's the problem, when I asked what a good time to come and get my dog back she refused. Stacy claims that they have had the dog for almost 3 weeks now and that because I took so long to get into contact with her she decided she's going to keep my dog because her kids have ""fallen in love with her"". I told her that was complete bullshit and that she was needed to give my dog back but she hung up on me and i assume she blocked my number.

I found stacy on facebook and she wasn't lying. I found a status from around three weeks ago talking about how she found my dog abandoned on the side of the street and took her in. She is now also posting pictures of her kids and my dog claiming they ""adopted"" her and renamed her.

I'm pissed right now and don't know what to do. That dog lived with me for over 5 years since she was a puppy and now because they've had her for three weeks they think they get to keep her. What can I do? I have all of the papers that prove I own her (dog licence, proof of ownership, medical records, etc) and she is chipped. I also have that police report.

WIBTA for divorcing husband over his past sperm donation,"1. Married for 8 years, have one child (3F) together

2. When we started dating he was very clear that he had donated sperm in the past

3. I never asked him how much but just assumed it was just a couple of kids

4. Actually ask him last week and he tells me the fertility centres last updated him at 47 kids

I was... Not expecting that many. 

It's clearly my fault for not asking how many. At the time, I literally said I ""didn't care"" about his sperm donation and ""didn't want to know"", so I can't blame him for not telling me how many. I literally told him not to.

....But 47?! Christ!!!!

AITA for showing up at my cousin's wedding in a hoodie and jean shorts?,"Last fall, my husband and I went to my cousin's wedding in another state. 

In the months leading up to the wedding, my aunt (cousin's mother) griped about how unconventional the wedding was going to be. She was happy for the couple of course but she didn't like that the wedding wasn't going to be in a church or banquet hall. The wedding was going to be a small and intimate affair in a scenic national park and then the reception was going to be in a nice rental house in the woods. I thought it sounded cool and unique but my aunt hated the idea of it. She didn't tell the couple tho. Just complained about it to us behind their backs. 

We traveled 600 miles to the wedding. We treated the trip like a vacation. Spent some money on lodging, food, sightseeing, etcetera. 

The day before the wedding, my aunt rounded up me and my family members and told us that she just found out that the dress code for the wedding was casual. Not gonna lie, many of us were stoked. I hate dressing up so I was all over the idea of a casual backyard bbq wedding. 

My husband and I had already packed nice clothes so we wore them to the ceremony. A few of my family members showed up to the ceremony in t-shirts and baseball caps. Immediately after, we changed into comfortable clothes for the reception. I wore a hoodie, daisy Duke shorts and cute sandals. 

I noticed that the bride's family members were still dressed up but I figured they didn't get the memo. The bride and groom and the wedding party were dressed to the nine's which I thought was weird for a casual wedding. The reception was awesome. Nice dinner, fancy lawn games, a bonfire. We had a blast. 

So we just found out that the bride and groom were very upset with us for wearing casual clothes to their wedding. They thought it was very disrespectful. Apparently my aunt lied to us because she wanted to sabotage their wedding and they were upset that no one checked with them about the dress code. This explains why my cousin and his wife have been standoffish toward us since the wedding. 

TBH we think they're overreacting because we all had fun at their wedding and it's not our fault we got bad info about the dress code. And they never specified the dress code in the invitation. But I still have to ask. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

UPDATE if I don't go on a second date with a larger lady because she doesn't match her Tinder pics?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/axpo27/wibta_if_i_dont_go_on_a_second_date_with_a_larger/

Hey again everyone. I finally have answers.

I never gave fake names to anyone so my date is now Alice and her sister is Gabby.

On Saturday I got a Facebook message from Gabby. It boiled down to ""This is stupid, will you meet Alice so she can properly explain?"" I try to get an explanation straight from her, but she refused and so on Sunday I go to a coffee shop to figure out wtf is going on. 

She was cute, my crush was strong, but I managed to sit down with a decent poker face. She pretty much burst into tears the moment I arrived. Lots of sorrys until she pulled herself together and I really nearly bolted bc I felt so awkward. 

Gabby was the one to suggest Alice use her pictures. Alice showed me her phone and... it was a picture of her from a few months ago and she swiped through and there were more pictures, ones she said she was gonna put on Tinder. All of herself... and she was bigger. 

I feel really fucking dumb. Still. Alice has been losing weight over this last year (down over 100 pounds!!!) and didn't have any flattering pictures bc she's continuing her diet and shredding weight off and her and her sister didn't know how to portray that on Tinder without scaring everyone off. So that's why Gabby suggested she use her pics bc they believe Alice will look like her soon (tho she has probably several months to go before she's close if I'm being honest, not that I care. Never did just thought I was being lied to).

When I sent the screenshot, she panicked and blocked me out of embarrassment/shame and it took a talking from her sis to meet me and come clean. I'm the first guy she's gone on a date with that wanted a second date so... fuck. Sucks to be all those other guys I guess because I'm taking her out this weekend again. 

I'm gonna be cautious moving forward bc that was a shit ton of drama for a first date, but I don't know. Maybe I'm being dumb? She's real sweet and we share the same hobbies and she's even pretty when she cries and my pa always told me that's how you know you're in it for the long haul and holy fuck I need to calm my crush down. This feels like high school again.

And that's that. Just wanted to clear up the catfish fiasco since I got a good many comments and PMs. Thanks again for helping me set my head on straight.",AmItheAsshole

I (21f) had sex with a guy I met on Tinder last night (25m). To me it was entirely consensual but about 10 minutes after he was crying and telling me I took advantage of him while he was emotionally vulnerable. What in the hell do I do?,"I guess some background is in order, I met this guy on Tinder about two weeks ago and we sort of chatted back and forth, we had a dinner date on Wednesday and agreed to meet again on Saturday. I did know that he had a recent break up but he told me over and over again he was ready to get back out there. 

So last night we had a great time. We ended up going back to my place and one thing led to another and we had sex. The sex was actually really good and he did most of the ""work"" so again I had no idea he wasn't into it. So after finishing I was just telling him hat I really liked him and would love to do it again but the mood just somehow just changed. 

At first he started saying he shouldn't have done that. I was like ohhhhhh-kay but whats done is done so lets just go back to being chill since we both enjoyed it. Then he started crying and started basically verbally attacking me that what I had done was the equivalent of ""male-r@pe"" and that I knew he was vulnerable but i'd pressured him into sex anyways. I told him that I was really sorry but I saw it differently. He ended up getting dressed and ran out. He was crying so loud and so intently I could actually hear him in the parking lot outside my balcony sliding glass door. 

He drove away and I haven't heard anything from him at all. I am so lost as to what to do. 

1. Should I call him and apologize? Even though I feel I didn't do anything wrong?

2. Should I call him to check on him but not apologize, and maybe just explain my side of the story?

3. Should I just Swayze him and say I've dodged a bullet?

4. Should I actually contact the legal services department at my school in case he was serious about the ""male r@pe"" allegation?


Thank you so much for the help!! I'm so lost!

tl;dr: was basically accused of taking advantage of a guy I met on Tinder. I'm lost as to what to do next?
 

Edit as of 840 AZ time: he just called me. He was very stiff and said he wanted to talk about last night. I said I wasn't comfortable with that and very confused. He kept trying to goad me into talking and I asked sort of joking ""what are you recording me or something?"" and then he hung up. Something tells me I stepped in a HUGE pile of shit. My dad is paying for me to consult with a lawyer first thing tomorrow...wow that was a hard conversation to have. 

Well if I become the first female #metoo you saw it here first.

TIFU by toothpasting in the nude,"This actually happened today and I'm still feeling the consequences. ..

While standing in the nude, waiting for the shower to warm up this morning I decided to try that toothpaste dance the kids do in the stands at hockey games. I was getting into quite the rhythm, doing really well and moving pretty fast. It felt invigorating... I noticed something was just a little off however, and started to make adjustments to try and figure it out. Turns out I had my hands open and flat and you're supposed to have them in fists. Well, I made fists and it looked perfect for a moment until I proceeded to punch the life out of my dick as it was flapping back and forth due to the motion of my hips.  I immediately bent over, smacked my face on the bathroom counter and fell to the floor. Now I'm sitting here at work with a sore dick and forehead, feeling like a fool.

TLDR: Toothpasting nude, punched my dick and hit my head. Left feeling like a  dickhead.

TIFU by drinking Starbucks.,"I'm currently in bed, huddled under the covers and riding out the shockwaves of trauma from this event. 

My first fuck-up was trying to cut out caffeine a few months ago. I succeeded, but also lost my tolerance for caffeine (was drinking an average of 8 espresso shots throughout the day). 

Today, maybe two hours ago, I went to a doctors appointment. This appointment was in a huge hospital, one that had a food court and of course, a Starbucks. It was a mental-health related program, so I was a bit on-edge afterwards. I saw the sign for Starbucks and the clouds of depression began to life. Oh hell yes, the sweet nectar of life beckons to me. 
I get in line and order a medium sized coffee, cream and sugar - something tame, I thought to myself. Not tame enough apparently. 

I got in the car and started to drive home. About ten minutes away, I feel a bubbling in my gut. Oh boy. It's fine, I say to myself, I can make it home without incident. Oh, how wrong I was. 

While I had been focused on keeping my asshole clenched, I had forgotten that nearly every road and intersection on my way home was clogged up by construction. Detours everywhere. Every time I thought I was getting close to home, I was forced to backtrack and drive a few streets over. At this point, I'm sweating and shaking, my legs are essentially vibrating, and I have no idea how I haven't passed out at the wheel yet. 

And then it hits me. The cramps. I got my fucking period. IN THE CAR. 

Any person with a uterus will tell you how bad cramps are until they are blue in the face. I will do the same, because when I ovulate, I get cysts all over my ovaries due to PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). Needless to say, it makes everything way more awful than it needs to be. 

My abdomen tightens up, trying to force all of the coffee-afterbirth and uterine tissue out of me, but I resist. I will NOT shit my car, and I certainly will not bleed onto my seats. That shit isn't even paid off yet. 

I get re-routed for what feels like the millionth time, and finally I see it: a road to home with no construction. I step on the gas and swing around every corner with the gumption and moxie of an F1 driver. In doing this, I have fucked up again. 

I currently have an inner-ear infection, and in my haste I have shaken up all the liquid in my cochlea. Vertigo. Vertigo like you wouldn't believe. 

To recap: I'm holding in a torrent of liquid regret, clenching my pelvic floor muscles to keep as much of my uterus inside of me as possible, and now I'm dizzy enough that I could no longer tell if my eyes were crossed or not. 

I fly into my driveway, throw my car in park and yank my keys out. I run to my porcelain throne as fast as my entirely clenched body would allow me, all the while bumping into things in my way because the vertigo hadn't gone away yet and I was effectively as coordinated as a drunk person. 

When I say it was a photo finish, I'm not joking. I started shitting BEFORE my ass even hit the toilet (everything landed in the bowl tho, thankfully). I was sitting there for, legitimately, nearly 45 minutes. 100% liquid. And it didn't stop for more than three seconds at a time. Once it was over I felt like I had run a marathon wearing lead boots. All of my energy was gone. I crawled upstairs on my hands and knees with the intent of getting in bed, but had to make a mad dash for the bathroom once again and do it all a second time. Finally got myself in the shower to rinse off all of my sweat and potential residue of my poor choices... and then had to stop mid-shower for a third round of misery. I feel another round coming, so this is probably the end of my post. 

TL;DR - If you're drinking coffee and have to drive home immediately after, maybe shit before you leave the coffee shop.

AITA for asking my transsexual ex-wife to dress more appropriately?,"My former husband (42) came out as a transsexual woman last year. As a male he had recently started to get into crossdressing but assured me it was just a fetish, so I was taken by surprise when he came out as he was always a very traditional, masculine guy. She (now Laura) has not started HRT yet but is living fulltime as a woman. Laura and I no longer live together but we share custody of my son (10).

Ever since I moved out and Laura has started living on her own, she has started to dress in extreme clothing. She's gone from wearing relatively normal dresses and skirts to microminis, fishnets, big heels, the full nines, and bold makeup too. Laura is a tall woman (6'4 or so) so in the heels she is very visible and this is what had brought on my current issue.

I am fine with what Laura wants to wear privately but my son is having an extremely hard time with it, especially when it comes to her picking him from school or taking him out for food. Recently he had a breakdown over it and told me that it was so bad he didn't even want to go to school anymore, and that everyone knew him as the ""drag queens son"".

I tried to talk about this privately to Laura, but she gave me the cold shoulder over the phone. My son asked me to come out with him next meeting so we could bring it up together there. The moment she walked in all eyes were on us because of what she was wearing. People were obviously listening and when I gently tried to bring up the topic and explain how our son was feeling, Laura became incredibly loud and angry over it and accused me of feeding my son lines because I was jealous of her confidence. To make matters worse, a table of nearby girls decided to join in and hurl abuse at me and tell me that I was a piece of shit for saying what I was. My son and I left in tears but Laura did not seem to give a single damn about how distraught he was and seemed to just be loving all the attention.

Ever since then I've been torn wondering if my own personal feelings are getting in the way of things and I was a bad person for asking Laura to tone things down, especially given she felt she had to repress herself for so many years. I'm extremely shaken by having a group of complete strangers step in and wonder if I've gotten old and out of touch. It just breaks my heart to see my son becoming so withdrawn and upset over this.

TIFU by missing the birth of my daughter,"Happened yesterday at 2am. 

So my wife was pregnant. I work from home in internet marketing so don't get out too too much, but she heard of a cool local tech conference and thought I should check it out. (Important detail to remember)

The conference was 2.5hrs away in a neighbouring city. 

Anyway.  She was 37 weeks pregnant (babies are typically cooked at 40), and has been feeling great so didn't see any issue with me being gone one night. Like, what are the chances?

So me and a friend packed up and left for the conference at 1pm Thursday for the evening networking. 

Fast forward to 11pm, we're having a beer before heading to bed after the networking is over, and I get a call from my wife:

""I think my water broke.""

""Umm.. what?!?""

We're still 3 weeks early so I say no you're probably not, go back to bed. Did some quick searches and Dr Google said that because she wasn't having contractions, and she was otherwise feeling fine otherwise, it might just be pee from baby pressing on her bladder. No need to alarm. 

10 minutes later I get a text, ""contractions started and they hurt like hell. Going to hospital now.""

She's home alone and has no way to get to the hospital so is thinking of calling an ambulance, so my friend says his wife will go pick her up and take her. I tell my wife what's going on and she agrees (she's almost incoherent at this point and can't talk or stand during contractions).

Meanwhile, we grab our shit and hit the road. 2.5 hours, we should be able to make it in time for the birth. Labors usually take 6-12 hours. No big deal. 

She gets to the hospital and they tell her that she's fully dilated and baby's already crowning. 

At this point they get her straight into a room (too late for an epidural), my friends wife gets me on FaceTime, and I watch in the passenger seat of a car via FaceTime my daughter being born in record time. 

Total time from water breaking to delivered child: 2.25 hours. 

I missed it by an hour. We get there and come cruising in and I got to meet my exhausted wife and beautiful baby daughter. 

So good news, I have a beautiful, healthy baby girl, bad news is I wasn't physically there. But she can't get me in trouble because she sent me to the conference!

My Fianc√© took my birth control pills and stabbed holes into condoms to try and get me pregnant.,"I'm in my late 20s and I got engaged for my fianc√© (29) who I've been with for 9 years. Our relationship has never really been tested and we get on really well. But recently he brought up that he wants kids. I said no I'm not ready and probably won't be for a few years. He got really mad and argued with me for a solid 10 minutes. I just moved on from it and didn't give it a second thought. 

A week later I couldn't find my birth control pills, they are usually in the bathroom cupboard but I couldn't find them anywhere. Later that night he wanted to have sex, I said I couldn't find my bc pills and he said it's alright he'll use a condom, I supposed that was alright so he went and got one from the bathroom. For the next few weeks we just used a condom and I didn't take the pill. In hindsight I should have got more when I couldn't find the original pack but I couldn't be bothered (my fault) 

On a few occasions we were having sex I noticed the condom was split, he clearly noticed all times and didn't say anything so I said stop. The next day I was putting the recycling in the trash, as I was putting it in I seen my pills at the bottom. I instantly knew he had binned them. He knows I deal with the trash so why we he be so stupid to just put them in recycling. 

It all made sense so I confronted him about the pills and condoms and he couldn't answer me. He just kept walking away. I was so mad at him, it's not right. You can't just force someone to be pregnant just because you want a baby. Does he have to carry it for 9 months?

He is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. The boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. They have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. My mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""I saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""They were in our garden 5 minutes ago I think now they're headed to the skate park"". I think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

One of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'Jake' is there. We once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
Now yesterday I was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. Jakes mom had called my phone two times but I didn't answer cause she was annoying me. My boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. We were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. It was all nice and peaceful and suddenly I hear a really loud knock. It really made us jump because it was just so sudden. I turn to look and there's Jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. I nearly hit the ceiling I was so angry. I go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt I just wanted to ask because I haven't seen Jake in almost two hours ect.ect. Apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. I really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. I also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

My boyfriend thought I was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. She also thinks I shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  I feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but I feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",AmItheAsshole

To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check.
""There's no charge,"" he says.
""No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit!"" she says.
""Honestly, ma'am,"" the mortician says, ""it cost nothing.

Just found out that my [25M] fiancee [25F] has been bullying my best friend of 20+ years [26F].,"Hi all.

I've been together with Hollie for three years and I proposed to her last summer, with a date set for springtime next year. She's an investment banker and the most gorgeous girl I've ever seen. We met on a night out. We moved in together after a year in an apartment that her parents are paying for. I thought Hollie was ''the one'' from our first date, but now I'm not so sure. 

I'm best friends with a girl called Sarah. We've known each other since we were little kids (grew up on the same street, parents knew each other, etc). I had a crush on Sarah when we were kids and had feelings for her throughout our teenage years, and she claimed to feel the same, but over the years we both dated different people or had other things going on in our lives. 

When I introduced Hollie and Sarah, it was clear that they were two very different people, but whenever I'm around they've always been civil to each other. However, Sarah has told me that Hollie is always giving her dirty looks and disagreeing with everything she says just because. I never noticed the former but the latter has happened quite a few times. 

However, Sarah confessed to me that whenever the two of them are alone together, Hollie is actively cruel to her. Making comments about her appearance, her background, her family, etc. I did not believe this and actually distanced myself from Sarah to protect my relationship with Hollie (who has been telling me to get rid of Sarah when I told her what Sarah had accused her of. 

I've not been that close to Sarah lately because of this, however, some of my friends got together at my best friend's house last night. Sarah was there and I brought Hollie along. For some reason Sarah left early and Hollie was really upset about something. She started crying when we got home but didn't tell me what was wrong. 

Early in the morning when Hollie was asleep I got a whatsapp voice message from Sarah which was 20 minutes long. It was a conversation between Sarah and Hollie which must have been taken yesterday. It started off OK, but Hollie started to speak more unpleasantly for no reason at all. She accused Sarah of ''hanging around like a bad smell'' and asked why anyone would choose Sarah over her. Hollie called Sarah ugly and called her family ''scum'' and mocked her job (Sarah is an elderly care assistant). She also told her that she'd make sure I'd want nothing to do with Sarah. At this point Sarah told her that she was recording all of this on her phone and would show it to me. Hollie can be heard sobbing and begging her not to save the recording. Sarah then said goodbye to her and Hollie can be heard shouting ''You f#cking b****!''

After listening to this I was not sure what to do so I pretneded everything was normal. I made Hollie breakfast like I always do. She's doing some shopping with her mom so she left in the morning and will be back late. 

I'm not sure what to do. I thought Hollie was everything I'd ever wanted. She was perfect. But now I'm fairly sure that everything Sarah has accused her of is true. The things she said to Sarah on the recording were disgusting and nothing like the nice girl I fell in love with. I haven't spoke to Sarah yet, because I'm struggling to find the words to apologise for not believing her. 

I'm not sure if I can continue my relationship with Hollie. Sarah was my whole world once, and even now I still care deeply for her. To know that my future wife wants - and is actively trying to - get rid of her is frightening. But at the same time I was so sure that Hollie was who I was meant to be with and I'm not sure I have it in me to break her heart. 

Should I break up with Hollie or try to salvage something with her, and how to I go about building bridges with Sarah?

"My landlord asked for next months rent early, and evicted me the next day. He refuses to refund rent money because ""it's my fault he was fined"".","I moved in last month. I paid direct deposit for half before getting the keys, half after receiving. Everything went smoothly enough for the first week. Then the one neighbour started banging on the wall, and I had a letter on the door stating the bylaws that no child under the age of 19 may reside in the building, referencing my 11 month old daughter that I have sole custody of.

I tried doing some research, as it is an independently owned complex within a strata. There wasn't much to find. I called the human rights board in town, they told me I had a case. I called the tenancy branch and they informed me that I was not covered under the Tenancy Act, as, for the 8 days out of the month he stays here, we share a bathroom and kitchen.

He asked for the rent money early, two days ago. I was hesitant to, but obliged. That's biting me in the ass right now. He was fined 550$ for allowing to me to reside in the complex with a child, and is being asked to leave as well. He blames me for this, and refuses to refund next months rent because the fine is ""my fault for not keeping that damn thing quiet"". He knew full well that I had a young daughter (and a cat), though I was assured by him before moving in that neither would be an issue.

My ex proposed. I said no. He is now talking about suing me. Advice?,"Just want to say this is going to sound insane but I am not trolling/making it up.

Me and this guy were together for 3 years. We're 19 now. We never talked about the future until a year in. Before then I'd try to discuss it and he would change the subject.

In short, I wanted kids, he didn't. I wanted to stay in Ireland, he didn't. I wanted to get married, he didn't. When I realised it was a bad match I broke it off but he asked to get back together, saying we were too young to worry about the future, and we got back together. This happened a few times over the next 18 months In this time we probably spent more time apart than together.

We knew early on that we wanted different things, and while marriage and kids are something I would want further down the line, I wasn't concerned about his open dislike of marriage and kids because 19 is too young to get married anyway. If I were dating him 10 or 15 years from now and he didn't want to get married, then I might have an issue, but when I'm barely out of my teens, it's not a huge concern, and just loving him and wanting to be with him is enough.

When I went to see him this time I was again, considering breaking up with him. Aside from the long term issues, he is also inconsiderate and has a mean streak that I really don't like. So when I arrived at his place, mentally debating breaking up with him for good this time, and he told me he wanted to take me out to dinner, I assumed he wanted to break up too, publicly so I wouldn't cause a scene. I don't normally cause a scene but being in public tends to prevent yelling, and we both yell every time we break up.

In the last year he has asked me 2 things that looking back now stand out to me. First he asked about jewellery, what kind of stuff I liked and what my taste was. I assumed it was because my birthday was coming up and he was getting me a bracelet or something so I told him simple and delicate, silver or steel rather than gold, if there was a colour then blue, nothing flashy or expensive as both my job prefers plain jewellery and it's just my personal preference. I also said ""go cheap"".

The other thing he asked me was how I felt about public proposals. I told him immediately that I, personally, disliked them as I felt I wouldn't be able to say no, even if I wanted to. I feel like public proposals are OK when they've been specifically requested and agreed on, but one that's totally out of the blue is not OK at all. I assumed he was asking about this because his friend had just proposed to his girlfriend of several years, publicly, and she'd accepted but admitted to him after that she would have preferred something private.

I never thought in a million years that he would propose.

So you can imagine my shock when we went to dinner and the first thing he did was propose.

The ring was huge, gold, gaudy, red gems around a diamond and the whole thing was the size and shape of a super bowl ring. He got on one knee, and held it out to me. We were in the middle of this popular restaurant and the place was packed. Everyone there could see what was going on and wasn't even trying to hide that they were looking at us.

I said no.

Well, I didn't so much say ""no"". I ran out of the restaurant.

He drove me there, so I got a cab back, and drove home that night.

I realise running out wasn't the best thing to do but I didn't know what else to do. I could feel everyone's eyes on me, and all I knew was that I didn't want to marry him or accept his proposal. I felt like I couldn't even speak, I was so upset about the whole thing. So I just got up and ran.

I just want to take the opportunity to say here that I really really don't care about the rings. Honestly, when I want to get married (which is absolutely not when I'm 19 years old) the right person could just turn to me and say ""wanna get married?"" and I'd say yes. I wouldn't even need a ring. I know I'm focusing on the ring and the public proposal a lot, but that's only because of 1) how far away it was from what I'd told him my taste was and 2) what happened next.

I didn't hear from him until a few weeks later. He said that he thought a proposal was something I'd want, but he saw now that it wasn't. He said that he was out of pocket for the rings. He'd bought us both the same one and gotten them engraved. He linked me to the jeweller's website and the ring was up for ‚Ç¨1450 (about $1650/¬£1300). When I asked why he was telling me this he said that he'd hoped I would cover the cost of mine. He said that as they'd been engraved he couldn't get a refund. He'd hoped that I would say yes to the proposal, in which case he wouldn't have asked me to pay, but I said no. He also said I'd embarrassed him by saying no in public, and should have said yes, and if I was really against it waited to say no when we were alone.

We both live in small towns where gossip spreads at church. Enough people were at the restaurant that night that both of us got asked about it at church on Sunday.

He has since messaged me saying he's debating calling in a lawyer to sue me for the cost of my ring (‚Ç¨1450) and he also says that I have caused him ""emotional distress"" by turning him down in public, and have publicly humiliated him for both rejecting his proposal in public and leaving him to deal with church gossip, which I had no part in spreading. He says he can also get some money off me over those other 2 things. So ‚Ç¨1450 for what he spent on my ring, and extra money for emotional distress and public humiliation.

I think his legal claims are all bullshit, and he wouldn't have a leg to stand on in a court of law, but I am not a law student or a lawyer. He is studying law currently and has an internship at a legal firm.

What do I do about all of this? Do I need to prepare myself for a lawsuit or is it not even worth worrying about?

Thanks in advance :)

EDIT:  He knew I wanted to get married but not to him. He not only knew this but said he had no intention of marrying me, either. He openly despised marriage right up until the time he proposed and he knows that we want different things out of marriage, and I told him that this was why I was breaking up with him the times before this that I have ended the relationship. During the course of our relationship he's also said stuff like ""we're still too young to think about marriage"", ""it's not like we're getting married"" and (my favourite) ""it's not like I'm gonna propose"" (that one was last April)

We just returned home from our vacation, and the last two days were hell on my imagination. I know I said in the last post that I wasn't going to do anything about it, but I found that I couldn't just sit there and pretend everything was alright. 

So I spoke to my brother.

We were alone, though our mother was in the house. It filled with lots of crying. He basically confessed to having those fantasies, but said that he would never hurt me in real life. I only read one of the stories, and apparently many of his other works also included me. I told him that he already did and he promised to stop publishing new ones and to get rid of/change the old ones. 

He asked that I not tell anyone about it (would ruin his life, he said) and in exchange agreed that he was going to get therapy when we both return to our colleges in the fall. Sounded fair, so I agreed, and we ended the convo with a hug at his request. 

In a sense, it felt like a really weird break up. Not sure how to better describe it. We most definitely will not be able to have what we used to have in the past, and I hope any awkwardness at future family events can be overcome by time/distance and a butt load of therapy. I'm glad it was sorted out, although that convo was definitely one of the most awkward ones I ever had.

I must admit that I was really homophobic and racist growing up. That was how I was raised. But when I moved to America, I met my wife and she helped me a lot. She helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. I owe that to my wife.

Yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. So we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. It took some time to sink in, but I understood. When I asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. She asked me if I was fine with it and I told her that I had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. I must admit that I felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

After that, I asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. She told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. I'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. So I started to get ready to prepare it. 

At this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. Idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. And when I came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. My daughter was crying and I was really shocked. I asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her.

I asked my wife to leave, because I was really angry. After my wife left I told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and I'll stand by her. My daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

Now, my wife refuses to talk to me. She told me that she will be back only if I agree to help my daughter become straight. Idk what to make out of this.

&#x200B;

Over the past year or so my girlfriend has been starting to experiment with women in the form of making out, dancing, etc. Overall I was okay with this as it's somewhat of a fantasy of mine in a living-through-her-vicariously way. Since I was a kid I have been stuggling here and there with a little body dysmorphia and often fantasize about being a woman with another woman. Normally in my day to day, however, I am very comfortable in my own body. So, like I said, I wasn't against the experimenting in any way.

&#x200B;

After talking to her about it numerous times, it went from just having a good time to not being comfortable with taking things forward to maybe having another person in the bedroom would be a fresh take on things. Typing this out it sounds like the classic she's-been-cheating-all-along, but I truly believe it's more of a discovery process.

&#x200B;

I told her I would definitely be willing to bring another girl into the bedroom and we agreed that the person would have to be right and someone we were both attracted to. Around New Years we were at our favorite bar for a party and I suggested we take a friend of ours home (not one from the couple). My girlfriend was hesitant, and I did not push, so that night we just went home and passed out together.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to last night, my girlfriend made plans to go out to an event with a group of our friends, but I decided to stay home and try to take care of some backlog projects I've had going on. She had been messaging me all night, and finally around 1-2am she said she was coming home and would see me soon. It got to around 4am and I decided to log into her Apple account to use Find My iPhone just to make sure she was somewhere safe. This is nothing uncommon, yet not a frequent occurrence. (inb4 comments about being overcontrolling and other accusations). I figured she had been drinking quite a bit and decided to stay at the couples' place.

&#x200B;

I've had a bit of insomnia lately due to stress from work and side work, so I finally climbed into bed around 5am. Then I heard the garage door open and she came up to the bedroom. She said we should talk about something important. She then said that she slept with the wife. For the first 15 seconds I was happy for her, but quickly realized there was more on the horizon. She then explained that the husband was involved, but was more focused on the wife. Though she did let it slip out there was penetration (not that it matters that much in my mind at this point).

&#x200B;

My girlfriend has endometriosis which makes vaginal sex extremely painful. After talking for a while, our recent struggles with my work stress coupled with her worsening condition made it obvious that our sex life hasn't been great. That's when she let it slip that while the wife was a good experience, she still hurt (which only happens with penetration).

&#x200B;

That's when it finally hit my that I had been cheated on. I explained to her that it's one thing if we're both on board for bringing another person into the bedroom, but to not even be consulted on potentially sleeping with another woman, let alone a couple, is beyond the limits. I love this woman, but between this and our diminishing sex life with a dash of pettiness that comes to mind, I realize this relationship is over. This is my first real relationship, and first sexual relationship. Right now I am just afraid of having to start over. I've been taken advantage emotionally in romances before, and this has done nothing but drum these bad memories up.",relationship_advice

Four days ago (Monday 11/4) I was parked in a very full parking lot and returned to my car in a distracted state. I didn't realize that I was parked next to a car that was identical to mine. I opened the unlocked driver's side door and put my leg in, but immediately withdrew my leg because I heard someone inhale sharply and then heard the passenger side door open. Obviously this wasn't my car so I began apologizing and, as I was shutting the door, I could see an elderly woman struggling to get out of the car.

I was still apologizing when she fell out of the car. I went around quickly and asked if she was alright, did she need me to call an ambulance, did she need me to go find whoever she was waiting for, etc. She told me I didn't need to call an ambulance, but asked if I would stay with her until her daughter came back. She didn't know which store her daughter was in and didn't have her number memorized. I helped her back into the passenger seat. 

She had an abrasion on her right palm, which I offered to disinfect since I keep a first aid kit in my car. She accepted and said she wasn't hurt anywhere else, just shaken up. She asked me for water and I gave her a bottle from my car. She told me she was diabetic and that her blood sugar was low and she didn't have her insulin with her, so I offered her a banana. We spent about 5 or so minutes together before her daughter came running up.

We explained to her what happened and the daughter was pissed at me, rightfully so since I did scare her mother and she fell. I offered again to call an ambulance to make sure she was alright and they both refused. I suggested they take her to her doctor as soon as possible to make sure she didn't injure anything from the fall. I apologized again and went home. 

This morning the daughter and her husband showed up on my front porch. I think they were trying to intimidate me since the husband stood there the entire time with his arms crossed and with what I assume was supposed to be a scary look on his face. 
The elderly woman and I only exchanged first names so I don't know how they found out who I am or where I lived. I asked and they said they ""had their ways."" The daughter told me she ended up calling an ambulance because her mother began to have a panic attack before they left the parking lot. I asked if she was okay and she told me that wasn't any of my business. She said that they were going to sue me if I didn't pay the ER bill and the ambulance bill. They said they wanted $3,500. I asked if her mother had insurance and was again told it wasn't my business. I asked to see the bills because I obviously have my doubts and they said they didn't have them with them. I said ""So you expect me to just hand you $3,500?"" and that pissed them both off. I told them to get off of my property and that I'd call the police if they refused or came back. I told them to have their lawyer contact me. They both called me a bitch and left. 

I've included every detail I can think of, so my question is could they really sue me? I understand you can basically sue anyone for anything, but am I legally responsible to pay these medical bills if they do in fact exist? 

Thanks in advance. I'm on mobile, so I apologize for any formatting errors. 

Edit: Thank you to those who responded. I'm 31, but often get mistaken for someone much younger. The daughter and her husband are, or look to be, in their mid to late forties. I suspect they may just have seen what they think to be a young and naive woman that may be dumb/scared enough to pay them.

I do have a home security system. I can also defend myself should my home security system fail. Thank you to those voicing concern for my safety.

Shortly after I posted I confronted Cam about everything and that I was depressed and upset with his behavior. 

He said he would start to help out more around the house. He also said he would try to stop ranting about work so much and just be better overall.

I gave him like 2 weeks to get it together. Surprise surprise he didn't change. 

I went to have lunch with an old friend and they asked me how things were going. I broke down and it was a realization moment for me I was wasting my time staying. Cam pushed me to the point where I didn't love him and who he was anymore. I decided enough was enough and I needed to leave. 

While he was at work on a Monday I packed up me and the cats and called my mom. She is my hero. She came with her van and helped me load up as much stuff as possible. She is letting me and the cats stay with her and my dad for a little bit until I find the right apartment. 

I waited for Cam to come home and let him know I was leaving. He didn't take it well. He said he was caught off guard and wasn't expecting me to leave. He said he gave his life to me and that I ruined everything. Immediately after I broke up with him and drove to my parents I felt a sense of relief. 

For the past couple weeks I've been trying to tie up loose ends, like getting the rest of my stuff out and trying to get off the lease. I feel very good about the decision I've made. I'm starting to feel happy again and so are my cats. 

Cam has been a complete jerk, which is to be expected. I'm trying not to get wrapped up in what he has been texting me but it still hurts. He basically accused me of cheating on him. I think it's easier for him to accept that as a reason than me not being in love with him anymore. 

Right now I'm just trying to find a good apartment to move to. I'm excited to live by myself again and be single for a while. I don't think I will be ready to live with anyone again for a while. I have also started to do things that I love again like bike riding and going on hikes with my friends.

UPDATE My [42M] daughter [14F] won't get an abortion,"Yesterday I posted [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because I didn't have ""ThrowRA"". I've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. Because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

**ORIGINAL** 

I \[42M\] am a single father to my daughter \[14F\]. My wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. She's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. She doesn't see too much of me because I work 9-7, but I'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

Around Tuesday, I noticed there was something off about her. She was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. Right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch TV together. I figured it was just moody teenage hormones. Except it doesn't stop. Friday I finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. She looked at me and just burst into tears. She cried more, so I held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""I'm pregnant.""

I was shocked. Utterly and completely shocked. I kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. I took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. I didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, I'd wait until she calmed down a little. Saturday she came down for breakfast and I sat her down and asked her her plans. She said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. I then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. I calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? I go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. She suggested she start online school, which I refused, saying I don't want her to ruin her life.

The thing is, I don't even want to consider adoption. I can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. I don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if I lose her?I told her this, and she asked me if I had no love for my grandchild. But I don't. I don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, I care about her. The girl I raised. I told her today that she had to abort her child. She cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. There's no way I'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. And for school, I don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

At this point, I see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, I'm kicking her out. It hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, I'm afraid her life will truly be over. I won't actually, but I'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. I'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do I get out of this?

Where do I go from here?

TL;DR: My daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**UPDATE**

So today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. It's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. Everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. They said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

After the doctor's I took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. I told her I had to know, she had to tell me. She refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. We went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so I took it and looked through her messages. According to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. She hadn't told him yet.   
I wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him I was \[daughter's name\] dad, and I needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. I expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so I called his mom and I told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. She asked if I was sure, and I said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. I said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. She said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. I asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. She asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. She hung up before I could say anything else. 

Now I don't know where I stand. I can't afford a lawyer, and I don't think I can make him get involved either way. I don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. Is there a way they could get out of paying it? I don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

My daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but I'm going to stop peppering her with it now. My sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and I hope a female influence will work better on her than I am. She's sending a little bit of money, and I think I may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and I can do.

AITA for making an obese man pay me cash to take up part of my seat on a long flight?,"So this month I was flying across the country on a long 5 hour flight, which I had booked and seats selected for. I specifically chose an aisle seat in a row of two, so no middle seat ‚Äî just the aisle and window. 

Well, a very obese man boards and I can tell instantly he is going to have a tough time fitting in any of the seats. I assume maybe he bought two hence why he's even attempting to board. I'm mentally crossing my fingers he's not next to me, but sure enough he ends up pointing to the window seat next to me to let him in. 

I get up and let him in politely, wanting to at least give him a chance. Well, he sits down and is easily seeping into about 1/3 of my seat. I sit down and am pressed up against him, making me uncomfortable. After a minute, I decided to be upfront and tell him:

""Sir, I'm sorry but this situation is not working for me, you're taking up quite a bit of my seat"". 

He wasn't rude, but sort of gave me a shrug as if there's not nothing he can do ‚Äî although he did sort of tighten his arms in to try and be narrower. It just wasn't enough, though. He still was overhanging over the armrest about 1/4th into my seat even when squeezing his arms in. I'm talking about fully hanging over the armrest into my seat. 

I end up stopping a flight attendant and ask her what can be done about the situation. She instantly tells him that he is likely going to need to purchase another seat. She goes to the front and comes back saying that there aren't any open seats on this flight, so there wasn't a way to move people so he could have two. This causes a very awkward silence. 

The guy seemed embarrassed and didn't want to get up. He mentioned how he can't wait for a later flight. I felt bad for him but I was also thinking about my own comfort on the long flight ‚Äî the comfort I paid for. The flight attendant tells him that unless someone on the flight agrees to let him take up part of their seat, he'll need to book another flight. The guy seems really flustered by this ultimatum, and here's where I made my offer. 

I told the guy, ""Look, I'll put up with this if you give me $150 ‚Äî that's half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances.""

He instantly agrees, pulls out cash and pays me. He even told me he appreciated it. 

Well the people sitting behind me (who keep in mind didn't volunteer to sit by him) were making under their breath comments about me being an asshole for doing that. I just ignored them and put the cash in my wallet. 

From my perspective, I gave the guy a valid option to stay on the flight and I was compensated for literally having only 75% of my seat max (let alone the feeling of a person's body pressed against you involuntarily). A win-win. He wasn't angry at all, if anything he seemed quite relieved we could work it out privately. 

After the flight, the couple behind me glared at me but I ignored them. This leads me to beg the question, AITA? ",AmItheAsshole

UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"Orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**TL;DR:** Wife and I tried having a baby. My balls are blocked, surgery is in July. Wife got pregnant anyways. It seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but I was told I shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. Wife is celebrating, I can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. Seeing Doctor on Monday to see if it could be mine.

Update **TL;DR** at bottom

First I just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  I can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

I took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  I had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  It wasn't until I got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that I was able to try and move on.  My wife and I actually met in a soccer league we were in together. We've had so much trust for so long that I thought those fears had gone away.  It wasn't until now that I really started to feel shaken like that again.

But I didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  A few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

It's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. I didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  I got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. I couldn't wait any longer.  I made our favorite omelets, and told her I needed to talk about something.

""You know I'm not Ashley, right?""

She knows me well.  Ashley's my ex who cheated.

So first I apologized.  I apologized because I let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  What should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

We talked for a while.  I told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. I told her how much I loved the relationship that we've built together, and I felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  She had never given me a reason not to trust her and that I still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  She thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  She volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

But something still felt off.  I honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  Normally she would have been upset that I didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling I couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

It seemed like she was saying all the right things, but I couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  Maybe I'm just being paranoid.  Maybe there's a gut feeling that I need to listen to.  But I ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if I still needed the surgery.

Turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  I've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. So I brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. The urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that I wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. He mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

Being there didn't really help.  I feel like I just got more uncertainty.  

She had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  We talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. She seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. She promised to do it in the morning.  I asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

There's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  I really couldn't put my finger on it.  We were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and I couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had Sunday.

I've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but I haven't been able to focus.  We have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  This morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. We don't do that, she's never needed to before.  And I checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time Thursday that I mentioned I was busy working on-site. We were supposed to go together.

I'm starting to go crazy. How do I bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  I'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  But I need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if I'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**TL;DR Had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  Urologist said I had obstructive azoospermia, implied I should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think I could be fertile.  Wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when I can't go.  Getting a second Urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

UPDATE:  I've been trying to center myself.  We talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  She claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  I didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  I'm just trying to not overreact right now. I don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and Im a Father! Or...not.  Thankfully she's not working late today.  

Thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

UPDATE:  I went for a long run to clear my mind.  Gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  I'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why I've still been struggling personally with some of them.  Regardless of what happens I'm done with any confusion left between us.

  Thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"LPT: When you see someone being harassed in public, act like you know them and get them out of the situation.","I took a course on civic courage (?) last week and we were taught to not approach the perpetrators when we see a dangerous situation in public -- that would not help the victim, and would just lead to us getting punched in the face too. Instead, we're supposed to reach out to the victim, address them by name and ask them to come with us. This gets them out of the situation without needlessly endangering you.

Example (we watched a video on this): Two drunk guys enter a subway car and start bullying a skinny young guy reading a book (taking the book away, not letting him get up). Another passenger goes over (but doesn't get too close) and says, ""Hey, Peter, I haven't seen you in a while, why don't you sit with me? How's the girlfriend?""

The people doing the workshop were former policemen and say this works 9 out of 10 times.

Trespassers called police on me for brandishing a firearm.,"Yesterday around 530 AM I heard a tapping on my window. My window faces my fenced in backyard which has a wooded area behind me. At first I thought it was a lizard but it was more rhythmatic. I went to look outside and as soon as I opened the curtains I see a hand tapping on my window. 

I then turned on my light and started to tap the barrel of my shotgun against the window. The trespassers saw it and immediately darted away. I call the police and a few minutes later they show up and ask where is the person with the gun.

I told them I have a gun and explained someone was trying to break in. They said they were called because someone was brandishing a weapon from inside their house, but I called and reported a break in, not on myself. Apparently the person I pointed the gun at, called the police. 

When I explained the situation, the officer kept trying to finish my story by saying ""You were ABOUT to shoot him until he darted away"" and they filed their report and left.

When I spoke to my sister she explained that the police were trying to help me avoid a brandishing charge because if I can say I had intent to fire versus intimidate then I can't say I was brandishing. 

I had no intention of killing anyone. What should I do? I don't know if I am going to have to defend against a brandishing charge, what about the trespassers? Is it brandishing when I am in my own house?

"Once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named Sam.","His order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. They trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  Their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

Sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  Everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  And all the realm realized, instantly, that it was Sam, and Sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored Magical Notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before Sam had ever reached one.

And on Sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  This time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  As the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that Sam had found the Second Note... 

And the next year on Sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  This time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as Sam hit the glorious Third Note.  People cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  Words cannot do justice to the experience.  The town flourished, as Sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

And on it went for the next few years, the Magical Notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, Sam's 25th birthday.  All at first seemed as normal... until Sam hit the Magical Note.  From the start, Sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  Sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  He doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the Magical Note that he knew must be there.

Suddenly, to the horror of all, Sam spontaneously combusted!  The two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  Soon the entire monastery was aflame.  By a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor Sam.

The townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

The mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""What happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

The old monk shook his head sadly. ""Isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""Sam sung Note 7.""

"TIFU by going to my parents house, and now I need to bleach my eyes.","Literally happened ten minutes ago, the fallout has yet to happen.


Bit of a backstory, I (26M) live about 45 minutes from my parents house, and my eldest sister (30F) lives across the street from me but works close to my rents.


My parents, and my youngest sister (15F) are out of town on vacation. Now, I generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. Plus I live in an apartment complex and don't have a garage).


So I'm going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.


This is where it happens. Now, my parents have two dogs. And I was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as I knew my eldest sister was house sitting and I didn't want them to lose their shit.


This is where the fuckup happens.


It works. I'm quiet. I sneak into the house, and silently close the door. I heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so I go, thinking the dogs were playing.


It was not the dogs playing.


It was, in fact, my eldest sister and her boyfriend. On the couch.

With her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.


I have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.


I also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process. 


And what she sounds like.


I literally screamed ""my eyes"" covered them and ran out of the house.


I'm outside, sitting in my truck contemplating my life.


Send help.



TL;DR Parents home is vacant other than my sister dog sitting. Went to work on my truck, saw my sister getting worked on, reverse cowgirl style.


Edit: Based on a lot of the responses, apparently reddit wants me to either A) Describe my sisters tits, B) Make a porno, or C) Go all r/sweethomealabama with her.
Y'all are animals.

Edit 2: Holy shit this blew up. Damn. What happened after was as I was sitting in my truck, they left. I went into the garage and did my work. We haven't talked yet. I'm gonna give it a few weeks for the memory to not be burned into my skull.",tifu
(Maine) UPS guy messaged me on Instagram to ask me about my discreetly packaged order. Is this legal? Who should I talk to?,"I got a DM request three weeks ago that I only saw today. It was form someone I don't know who lives in my area and works for UPS(I googled his name, it said his job title and where he lives). He asked me if I ordered something from (name of adult website). I did, in fact order something from the website, but the package return address has a corporate name (discreet packaging) on it instead of the website name. I don't remember the package being damaged, but either way I'm not sure why this guy would ask me that, and why the question would come from his personal Instagram account. 

I'm more than a little creeped out by this, and I want to know if this is just poor taste or if it's illegal to ask personal questions about the deliveries. If it's illegal, who would I talk to to report him?",legaladvice

First of all, I would like to thank everyone for the support, it was really appreciated and it's what let me have the courage to go to the police so I am very grateful. 

I have received some pretty messed up private messages, and I wanted to let you guys know because I don't know how to feel about them, for instance this one: Date Rapist Here: Hey I just wanted to let you know you really should keep your fucking mouth closed. I knew a person who didn't and things didn't end well for them. ;) 

(I can provide screenshots if necessary) 

As for how it unfolded: I gave my boyfriend my phone to text S if he wanted, he texted him from his phone as well as from mine. He made it seem like nothing had happened at first on his phone while texting him from mine that I was very upset about what had happened, that I needed an explanation and that I was telling my bf everything. His answer was ""How could you not know I have always liked you? I thought you liked me too."" ""I am sorry I went too far but you gave me all these signs"" ""Anyway,\*bf\* doesn't need to know, let's keep it between us, he wouldn't believe you anyway"" and the worst one ""this could still happen if you want, we'll make it our secret."" Needless to say my boyfriend was pissed. He then sent a message saying ""what about the drink you got me at the end, I saw you put something in it."" He then called many times but we didn't answer and he ended up saying ""you're crazy, you're imagining things, what the hell is wrong with you?"" then several other messages calling me names that we didn't answer. 

My boyfriend called him and told him that I had told him everything, that he should beat him up and that he would if he ever showed his face again. He also talked to our other friends but not in details, just saying how he acted weird towards me. I don't know what is going to come of that. 

Honestly, I just don't want to see him again now. The police has my report and I hope he never tries that again but I can't do much more. 

Thank you again for the support.",relationship_advice

TIFU by reading my brother's journal,"This did actually happen today, as the clock had just barely struck midnight and Christmas was upon us. Also, this is my throwaway because dammit, I'll not have this following me to my actual account.

I was in the laundry room which doubles as the storage room, where belongings go to die. I saw a book that did not immediately appear to be a journal on one of the shelves, so I grabbed it and flipped it open to the middle. I recognized my younger brother's handwriting and knew I had wandered onto private property, but my eyes lingered a little too long on the page. 

My brother has been out of the house for several years. He deployed to Afghanistan and got married when he returned to the States. He's always been a little weird but we (mostly) accept his quirks as just social anxiety and move on. But there I was, in the asscrack of Christmas morning holding a journal that he obviously had written during his teenage years. It was one of those journals that ask you questions and you fill in the answers, and of course the question I opened to was ""what's something you hope no one ever finds out about you?""

There, staring at me from the page was the following sentence: ""that I had sex with one of the cows.""

Yes, we grew up on a farm. I don't believe he was speaking merely of a corpulent maiden. 

I consider myself open minded, and have prepared myself for various scenarios with my siblings. What if they come out as gay or trans, what if they become addicts, what if they end up in prison, what if they were to join the circus. I have never entertained the possibility of ""what if they romanced the livestock."" Life just doesn't prepare you for random bestiality. 

Tl;dr I found out my brother dabbled in bovine sexual escapades and now I live in a world where I just have to know that and pretend I don't.",tifu
TIFU By applying for engineering jobs and telling employers I'm retarded,"So this has been going on since I graduated in May and started applying for jobs. I've submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and I have not had much feedback. Well the vast majority of these jobs have you check boxes with disabilities you may have and since I have ADHD, I have been checking the box marked ""Intellectual Disability"" all these months. 


So about fifteen minutes ago I'm going through an application like normal and I get to the part where they ask about disabilities. This is what it reads: ""Intellectual Disability (formerly described as mental retardation)"". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that I've been applying for jobs that I really want and I have unknowingly classified myself as mentally retarded. I don't deserve these jobs for being so dumb and fucking up all these applications.


TLDR: I've been checking the ""Intellectual Disability"" in applications to declare ADHD when that actual means mental retardation. I've fucked up over a hundred job applications.",tifu
"AITA for insisting if I can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?","Throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

So I [20m] live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend [23f], a guy from my uni course [20m] and his cousin [26f]. For the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. However this has been a real point of contention lately. 

About six months ago I began a relationship with a guy I've known for a couple of years [21m]. I know it's still a fairly new relationship but I really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. Up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. This was mostly due to the fact that I have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. Instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch TV and get takeout or cook together. I didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10PM because of his work schedule. 

So the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that I need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". I asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". I pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. She said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". Note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. I confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. I asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. I pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

My potential assholery: I've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  If I answer the door to anyone's partner I'll send them away. If I come home and someone's partner is there I'll make a point to mention that I thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. I've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. Everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me I'm being unreasonable. I know I'm being petty, but I think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and I'm trying to make that point. Am I really the asshole here?

ETA: some questions people keep asking: 
1. If I knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something I'd have included it. I'm not aware of anything he does and when I ask why 26f doesn't like him I just get a shrug and ""just do"". I will also state I'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners I've had. 
2. We don't hang out in the living room much. We literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that I can't get on my bedroom TV and there's nobody else in there. We use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. A lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26F, *not* my best friend. My best friend is 23F. Not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago I was moving out of halls at university and 23F was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. At the same time, a dude from my course - 20M - was looking for a flatshare. We couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26F - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. I only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.

"Can we successfully sue someone ""advertising"" items on our property?","My father lives on an 18-acre wooded property in Oregon that he and I jointly own (I live in California). He's into classic car restoration and started collecting ""barn finds"" over 20 years ago. Today he has more than 40 vehicles on the property, mostly in barns and old chicken coops, but all relatively well cared for. Most are classic cars worth non-trivial amounts of money (old Fords and Hudsons, 1960's muscle cars, that sort of thing), and he's whiling away his retirement years pulling the cars out one by one to restore and sell off.

About a year ago he started noticing small thefts from some of the cars. Hubcaps started vanishing, engine parts would disappear from previously running cars, one car had its interior partially stripped. He initially assumed that it was local thieves until a couple of months ago when he caught a couple of videographers going through one of his barns, documenting everything inside of it. While they waited for the sheriff to arrive (at gunpoint, FWIW), the videographers explained that they'd learned about the property through a ""barn finds"" auto blog and discussion board. Apparently, the property had been ""found"" about 18 months previously, was described as abandoned and had been visited a number of times by the members of this barn finds forum. They also solved a mystery. About six months prior, my dad had found some deep muddy ruts on an abandoned access road at the back of the property. We learned that a group of these guys had tried to ""rescue"" a very valuable and collectible car stored in one of the outbuildings, but had got stuck in the mud and had been planning on trying again. 

The property is now VERY well marked with signs prohibiting access, and we've re-strung the barbed wire fences around the perimeter. My dad also felled three trees to block some of the old access roads on the side and rear of the property to prevent any additional ""rescue attempts"". 

Our problem is that the original website STILL has the information online including detailed photos of everything we have on the property. They are still listing the exact location of the land, including directions about how to approach it to ""avoid neighbors"", but have added a few comments about ""an angry old man living in a neighboring house who is trying to claim the abandoned property and derelict cars"". Since catching the trespassers, our fences have been cut three times, a number of additional parts have vanished (including an irreplaceable steering wheel from a 1938 Mercedes Benz), and the barns have been forcibly broken into several times.

So here's my question. Because this all started when the blogs primary authors trespassed on our property, documented our cars, and falsely labeled them as ""abandoned"", and because they continue to list them on their website, is there any chance that we could successfully sue them and recover some of the losses we've experienced over the past year? Between the new fence, signage, and the value of the lost parts, he estimates that we're probably out more than $15,000 at this point. We've identified the owner of the blog and believe that he has the financial resources to pay a judgment, but I'm not sure whether it's worth the effort. I personally know two lawyers. One is telling me to sue their arse off, and the other is telling me that we'd be wasting our time and money. 

So, /r/legaladvice, what's your take? Do we have a case?",legaladvice
UPDATE: My GF was raped and became pregnant. I broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.,"Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

I'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.

Yesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

She told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

After I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.

Then she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.

My GF then called me, and told me everything.

She will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

I discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I put my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)

She further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.

I love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.

I'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

Also, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.


Now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).

4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

AITA for sleeping over at my gfs 4 nights a week making her roommate uncomfortable and causing her to flip out?,"Let me preface this by saying that I (24m) and my gf (32f) who we'll call Liv, have been seeing each other for close to a year now. I've been living in a shared house with 8 blokes in a small 2x2m room that barely accommodates a single bed. This is the sole reason why she doesn't sleep at mine. I'm saving a lot on rent living here even though the living conditions are poor.

Now, I've been staying at my gfs house 4 nights a week for the past few months. Her beds bigger for starters and I cant cook at home because it's always congested, so Liv and I cook a meal twice a week at hers. She has a roommate who we'll call (Bianca) that she's known for quite a few years and they get along fine. I've tried my best to get to know Bianca but it's not reciprocated and I can feel the awkward tension between us a mile away. She's never asked a question about what I do for work, or anything of the like, and typically responds with one word answers.

Liv told me that Bianca feels very uncomfortable living with me. I hate being the cause of her discomfort. Whenever I'm at Livs house, I don't use the living room and go straight to Livs room whenever i arrive (usually late after work). Besides cooking with Liv, I'm usually mindful of my time spent in the bathroom.

Here's where Liv and I may have screwed up. We were taking a shower together and took a bit longer than usual (20-30mins). All of a sudden Bianca comes out of the room and slams the front door shut and sends Liv an angry text about taking too long and that she needed to use the bathroom and that she's selfish etc. 
We both put ourselves in her situation and said we would've knocked on the bathroom door to ask us to hurry up if we were busting, but she's a bit more timid than we are.

Their relationships gone down the gutters since I came along and I can't help but feel responsible. 

On an end note, Liv and I want to move in together within a few more months after her lease finishes, but for now we're stuck in this predicament.

My mates telling me I'm an asshole for staying over 4 days a week rent free and I should respect the roommates boundaries and not see her as frequently. But I see it as the next step before moving in together, that I'm only there at night and it's normal for couples to see each other more frequently before they move in. So AITA?",AmItheAsshole
TIFU watching incest porn,"*Throwaway account because that's where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* 

This happened yesterday. I was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in ""bad dad"" mode when she sees me this weekend. All I wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so I went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. That's all this was. Research. 

So, the ""daughter"" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. Of all people. If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn't answering his damn phone.

Cut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn't the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who's super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&A: 

*""You like fucking me don't cha, daddy?""* 

*""Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... ""* 

My old man unknowingly activated the car's Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last. In this case, it was fucking incest porn. Now, I never closed the video before I left the house, but I did pause the motherfucker. Yet, somehow, my phone went Skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.

I frantically turned off the ""radio"" and did what I do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. 

Dad: Suppose that's one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids.

I immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home.

TIFU by genuinely forgetting I had a joint in my pocket and trying to board a plane in Amsterdam and getting caught.,"So this literally just happened 30 mins ago. 

I would freely and happily admit if I tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. 

Came with a couple of friends for the weekend to Amsterdam for a birthday. It's a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

I'm sure most people know the Dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit 'coffee shops' and buy and smoke joints. 

Had a fun party night last night in town. Went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. Had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

In a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, I put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. Got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. Rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...'did I ditch that joint'?

At this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

'Sir, do you have anything in your pockets' says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

Holy. Fucking. Shit. What to do? I'm still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. Do I come clean? No way-too late for that. Got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

Go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. But, Schiphol Airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. I'm asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. I'm sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did I smoke that joint??? Airport guys hands pats pocket. I feel object being pressed into hip. FUCK FUCK FUCK. 

'Sir, empty your pocket please'? Says airport guy. My partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. In slow motion I see the penny drop on his face. I dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. Audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. I feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

I'm dying inside. I say to pat down guy, 'oh god. I'm really sorry, I forgot that was in th...'
'HAHA, SURE, SURE - THATS WHAT THEY ALL SAY'! Laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

I'm placed to one side. Customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). Just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the Dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

Customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, 'Don't worry Sir! Don't look so scared! You are 20th today and you won't be last! I'm sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately I can't let you leave Amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home'. 

I almost wept with relief. I was made to sign a form to say he'd taken joint off me....and that was it...

I'm in a bar in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. To all you Dutch-bless your hearts. You're the best. I'm sorry I was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

TLDR I was a hot mess and genuinely forgot I had a joint in my pocket. Got caught with it. Dutch customs were amazing about it. 

Edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

Edit 2, Thanks for the shiny stuff. First awards (on a story about my drug use).  I'm from UK for those asking.. My flights just landed and I made it through UK customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. I've just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. It says under what was taken, 'joints'.

AITA for mocking a Girl with a height requirement?,"Backstory, Im 19, 6ft1 and I use tinder frequently. I also used to be really short, like up until 17 I was sub 5ft7 and got rejected because of my height more than once. Anyway, I matched with this girl Sandy on Tinder and we started talking a bit. A few messages in she asked me how tall I was, and I pretty much instantly knew where this was going. I checked her bio and sure enough, some stupid ""5ft10+ only"" bullshit was there. Anyway, I said 6ft1, and she seemed pleased. 

Then I asked her how tall she was, sure enough, she was only about 5ft2, to which I basically replied mocking her for going after tall guys, and I called her a ""picky midget"", which maybe was a bit out of line. Anyway, I started goofing on her, making a bunch of jokes about footstools, and calling her out for having those preferences. Also, she isn't the thinnest girl around, not fat or whatever, but anyway, I jokingly asked her what a fat girl was doing using numbers as dealbreakers, and she called me an asshole and unmatched.

 I feel like a bit of a dick, but those preferences are mad dumb though, and I think she kinda had it coming.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by leaving my ear tubes in for 13 years and not realizing my hearing was going to be different when I took them out,"Happened this week and I just read another user's post about breathing through one nostril and I felt inspired to share my own story.

Context: I've had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. My childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as I fought them off, and surgery. I've had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. My mom and I honestly lost count because there were just too many. My last tube set was put in when I was in 5th grade I believe. I was around 10 or 11. 

I've lived my entire life with them and they've never caused problems. In fact they've helped a few times! I feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. It's awesome. 

So here's where the issues started. 4 months ago I started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. I ignored it because at this point in my life ENT doctors give me a lot of anxiety. But the symptoms started getting worse so last month I bit the bullet and went in. I saw the same doctor I had seen and a child. I couldn't believe he was still alive! He told me I developed a polyp on my tube and it's been in there so long he wants to remove it. I knew this day would come so I agreed.

My surgery was last Thursday and immediately post OP I realized things were off. My ear popped more times than I could count and I realize I feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. My hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. Usually I blast my damn music in my car but now I drive around at 6 volume. And finally my voice has changed. The way I sound to myself it's completely different to what I've come to know over the course of my life. I can't really tell if I'm whispering or shouting just yet because I've never heard this voice before and it's going to take some getting used to. The kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. I guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! I genuinely did not. 

PARENTS: please remove your child's ear tubes before they reach adulthood. 

Edit: Thank you for the gold! Thank you so much for the Platinum!!! Thank you for the silver!!! 

TLDR: I've lived my entire life with tubes in my ears and they were effecting my life in more ways than I realized.",tifu
AITA for telling one of my bridesmaids to take her glasses off during photos?,"I am getting married in a few weeks and have my bridal party primed and ready, but had a huge disagreement with one of them yesterday. 

Her name is Tara, and she is stunning. She's legit the prettiest out of our entire group. Absolutely gorgeous. However, there is one issue. Tara has terrible vision. She needs very strong glasses and even with them on her eyesight is bad. She gets the lenses thinned down as much as possible and even then they are so thick you can't see her eyes behind them. Her eyes can't tolerate contacts.

In our ''bridal meeting'' yesterday, I asked if it was possible for Tara to take off her glasses during the main photos. I wasn't saying this to be cruel. I'd never ask her to take them off during the wedding party and walk around blind, but I'm just asking her to take them off during photos. Without those glasses she's absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, way more than me, but with them on her eyes look weird and distorted and would take all the attention away in the photos for all the wrong reasons.

I brought this up with her but she got really huffy and sulky, told me to try on her glasses so I could see what she would be seeing during the photos if she took them off. I did and it was horrible, but I could stomach it for a few minutes to help out a friend and think she's being really unreasonable. She left early and the rest of the bridal party got at me for asking something so ''horrible''. I don't think it's an unreasonable thing to ask. I'm doing her a favour. Without the glasses she'll easily be the hottest bridesmaid so I would have thought she'd be OK with it.",AmItheAsshole

Eventually she starts talking about one of them as if he's ""like you.""(me) again no big deal.

My parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. I am sick of this shit (Florida),"For clarity we're both minors. I'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. She has never been right since we were little kids. Always violent. She bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when I was 5 because I wouldn't let her ride my bike. All of my life I've been putting up with this shit and I have had enough.

She hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. My parents wont do anything about it. She's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. I really don't know what is wrong with her. She's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. My parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. They refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". Which brings us to today. My parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. Whatever, not important.

Anyway, I was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. We decided to go to the Dollar Tree to get some snacks. Demon didn't buy anything. As we left the store I could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. I confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! I don't know why. Don't they make meth out of those or something? So I told her I was going to call mom. I pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! I was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was I going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. I took her down and had her pinned on the ground. That's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will NOT stop otherwise. I had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. She got me in the throat and I was letting her go! I was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. Blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

It took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. It hurts like a bitch. My friend gave me a bunch of Tylenol and it still hurts. I came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *I* do to upset her?! I was so angry I told them I was calling the cops and my dad told me I couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! Is that true??? 

Something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and I'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  Please help me. 

Update: Well shit went down basically how I expected it would. My mom called me very upset that police had came. What happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. I asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her Baker Acted because I was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. Well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and I guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. My mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. She said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved. ",legaladvice
I (19f) dumped and blocked my boyfriend (19m) for his comments about my neighbourhood.,"I don't want anyone having the slightest clue about where I'm from, so I'll be kinda vague.

&#x200B;

I live in a very poor hood with a problem with gang-related violence. It wasn't all bad, because there was also a community of people who loved and helped each other. It's home. Now that I'm at a huge university in my city, I've met people from all types of backgrounds. Of those people, is my boyfriend, who is from a well-off family. He's never had to worry about making rent or pretending not to be hungry so your mom doesn't cry when your parents think you're sleeping. But I was taught not to talk about money, so we really never covered that. We really did love each other and he made me feel complete.

&#x200B;

In my neighbourhood there is a small *""establishment""* that offers free *""services""/""products""* to kids who get good report cards/GPA. That applies from elementary school and until the end of College. College kids who provide ID also get a crazy discount. Finishing high-school isn't something super common, so it's a great way to reward us. The good-grades thing usually stops after like 6th grade, so it's a great way to encourage kids.

It's like, in my HOOD hood and hasn't been ""discovered"" yet by any of those people who think relative poverty is trendy. I think they're too scared to come this far out lmao. It's super lowkey.

I took my boyfriend to this restaurant and he was cool the whole time. He never seemed scared or judgemental. When we walked in, I was getting out my school ID. I explained to him the rule and how much it meant to me. He laughed. I asked him what was so funny.

He said ""They shouldn't applaud a fish for swimming"". I asked him to explain what the hell he meant by that.

He says that they're just giving out handouts for people who are doing the bare minimum. That getting good grades and going to school is an expectation, not something super revolutionary. I told him that IS where I live. It's not easy to stay in school, when nobody around you does.

This started a huge argument.

I asked him how many friends of his dropped out, he said none. I have 3. They were smart kids, but they got caught up in dumb shit. It's really easy to do that in my neighbourhood. My mom goes to a new funeral every week. Some of the kids I grew UP with are in jail right now. My mom STILL hides from me whatever the hell my cousins are up to. He said that giving the kids free stuff for something they don't deserve is like welfare. That there's ""nothing impressive about NOT being a criminal, it's basic requirement for being a part of society"". And that shouldn't get you free shit from a ""ghetto ass *'establishment'* '"". That this is why people get dependant on welfare.

At this point I told him I was done. I didn't want to debate, I didn't want to talk him. Not then, not ever again. We just went out separate ways. I broke up with him as soon as I got home.

He thinks it doesn't make sense for us to break up after something so small. That we're not going to be one of those couples that throws away everything over one conversation. I told him, yes the fuck we are. He's been trying to contact me but he's blocked on everything.  I think I may have overreacted with the block, but I want him to leave me alone. I don't want to work it out.

All my friends agree with me, but they've lived in the same neighbourhood..

I'm not saying I HAVE to be with someone who's from my hood. But I have to be with someone who at least gets it. Especially when ""it"" has shaped who I am today. Idk what kind of person I am, but I think I might need to be in a relationship with someone who gets it. That ""establishment"" means a lot to me.

Edit: I'm sorry I wasn't clear. Should I let him reach out to me? I don't want to get back together, but should I unblock him and talk it out. I'm worried that I'll fold and we might get back together. I've seen my friends do it all the time, they always go back. I'm worried conversation will make that happen to me. **I didn't suddenly stop loving him** and he still means a lot to me. But our core values don't align. What he said and did disgusted me. In the very place that means so much to me, he shit all over it.

Edit: Guys I did not make it out the hood at 19, I still live there lmao. I'm still a fulltime student at a big university in my city, working my ass off so one day I can get my whole family out.

AITA for basically telling my ex girlfriend that she's not as hot as my current girlfriend?,"My ex (24f) and I (24m) dated 5 years ago. We were together for about a year, but then she dumped me out of no where for another guy and broke my heart. She and I shared the same circle of friends so I continued to be cordial with her for the sake of our friend group, and we remained friends until we graduated and I distanced her out of my life and no longer speak to her. I'm still close with my friend group, but they have drifted from her over the past year. I'll still see her sometimes when we have hang outs with the larger group, but I no longer speak to her and we just avoid each other.

This past weekend my friend had a pre-game/party for his birthday and she was invited along with our other friends. I have a new girlfriend (23f) that I have been dating for a few months (she is absolutely amazing, drop dead gorgeous, kind hearted, thoughtful, etc. I never thought I could feel this way about someone). I invited her too, and she knew my ex would be there but was okay with it.

At the pre-game, my ex had a couple shots, was maybe tipsy. She came up to me and my girlfriend and started talking to us normally. I was kind of confused as to why, but just went with it. She then says to my girlfriend, ""Hey did you know me and Ilovepotatoes22 used to date back in the day?"" to which she says, ""Yes, I'm aware"". Ex gf smirks very subtly and under her breath says, ""Yup and he sure downgraded"" while looking me dead in the eye. My gf said ""Wow, I'm not interested dealing with this, excuse me"" and excused herself to go talk to some of my other friends. I was angry, I truly don't believe I ""downgraded"" as my current gf is the most beautiful girl in the world to me, and in my eyes I do find her more attractive than my ex. I told my ex ""I'm not sure what you're on right now, but gf is definitely an upgrade in every aspect possible so do not get that twisted. Let's just do what we should have done 5 years ago and never speak another word to each other again"". 

She went to the bathroom crying and my friends over the past few days have been telling me that she told them I called her uglier than my current gf.

Why did my mom start laughing hysterically before she died?,"My mom just recently died of lung cancer. A couple hours after the ambulance brought her home for hospice, she was sleeping, when she tried to hop out of bed and sit in a chair. Then she tried to take all her clothes off. Which, I've read is all normal for end stages of life.

But what really got me was that when we got her back into bed, she just started laughing hysterically for like 5 minutes straight and then basically became unresponsive after that.

It was pretty disturbing. Probably more disturbing than when she evacuated her bowels, even, because at least I was told that would happen. I just can't get that broken laugh out of my head. I was wondering if that might be a symptom of hypoxia or something or if that's also a normal thing to happen at the end of one's life. I couldn't really find anything about it on the internet. And if I'm going to have flashbacks about it, I just kind of want an explanation or to know if anyone has experienced the same.

Edit: Thank you, everyone, for your explanations and your kindness. Fortunately, my original doctor and therapist from when I was in high school (when my mom first got sick) are in my insurance network again.

I have been neglecting my OCD, depression, and anxiety for years, but no more. I have a life to live.

TIFU by trying to make myself last longer during sex.," This happened earlier this week and I'm still processing it. Also, throwaway because I don't want my grandkids to find this one day. 

My longtime girlfriend had just completed her time of the month, and we were ready to engage in some heated sexual activity. We're both going through rather busy times in our life right now, so sex doesn't come as often as it should, but enough to fulfill our needs. Now, the past few weeks I've been helping (doing) my GF do homework for one of her online classes. Because of this, she realized she owed me and decided to pay me by way of sexual favors. Unethical? Maybe, but I'm not complaining. So, she begins to initiate foreplay and start to enjoy one of the better blow jobs of my life. She does her thing for a while and I stop her a few times before I hit her with that high fructose porn syrup. After edging a few times, I decide to return the favor and go down on here. I do my thing, she does hers, and now back to me. Well, by this time we're about an hour in and she starts to get tired. I finally comply with her and prepare to unleash my homemade protein shake. However, because I have delayed the inevitable for so long, she is taking breaks every few licks of the tootsie pop. The next four events happen all simultaneously. I let my lover know its time, she comes up for a breather, my Johnson flops down on my stomach (I'm on my back), and I treat myself to a very salty penis colada. It. Was. Everywhere. A catastrophic and life-changing event. I, and nor should you, ever take those cum shot compilations for granted. Those girls are troopers.

AITA for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?,"I (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. My boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. He gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. I'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

However, there's one girl in our class, let's call her Victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. She goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. I know this is the case, because I've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

I've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and I don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. However, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. I rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. She was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him I was there too.

Victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. I snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. You're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

She looked super embarrassed and walked away, and I later heard she'd gone home crying. I feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. AITA?

TIFU by falling asleep while tanning next to an attractive girl,"There's no obligatory ""this didn't happen today"" because this happened a few hours ago and I'm still mortified.

I'm on holiday with family and on a cruise, we all decided it would be a great idea to go tanning after a long walk around the city we're docked in. We went to the tanning area on the top deck and I split from my family as there wasn't many beds free and I saw a bed open next to this really attractive girl who looks early 20s (same as me) and I think I could have a good shot here so I occupy that bed and make a few bits of chit chat until the tiredness from the walk kicks in and I completely deck out and fall asleep right there. I must've moved around a lot while asleep because I woke up 15 minutes later by a family member telling me to cover myself up as one of my balls was hanging out of my shorts. 

First thing I did was cover up then look to the side to see the girl is no longer there but probably saw just like everyone else who walked past in the 15 minutes. I'm on this ship another week and the embarrassment will live with me forever. Help.

TL;DR: fucked up my chances with a girl by my own nutsack that fell out while I was sleeping

EDIT: Saw the girl in the breakfast room and after a while of thinking of what to say I went up and talked to her it went along the lines of ""so I don't know if you was there but I showed off a little more than intended yesterday"" she said she left before that happened to go for dinner but would've found it hilarious so I guess that's a massive win! I said I'll catch up with her later and she sounded happy with that so I guess it wasn't a complete embarrassment!

I(F30) divorced my ex Husband (M36) because of my MIL(F60s) and suddenly he wants back in,"I will be rambling a little as I am very mad right now. Sorry for my bad English. It is not my first language

My Ex and I were married for well over 5 years and together for 10 . His mother was a nightmare. She would spent her time belitteling me and tried humiliating me. I could take it as i loved my husband and didn't want to make him choose between her or me.

Of course I would always tell him what she would be doing and he would always brush it off as her being ""a loving and over protecting mom ""

When she would say something racist ( I am Hispanic and they are white) he would laugh it off, when she would make a comment of me being a gold digger ( even tho I earned more than my Ex) he would just say ""Oh mom "" . He would also get mad at me if I ever stood up for myself.

But the straw that broke the camels back is when we had our daughter. My MIL would always try to parent her and say that i would do something wrong .

My daughter has an irritable colon and she can not ingest any kind of fucking oils or artificial things. And guess what that looney of a Woman did??

She fed my 3 year old daughter essential oils( she is not anti vaxx , just very stupid)  to make her go to sleep . She was in the ICU. I had it and i confronted my husband who said "" she only did what she thought was best "".

I lost it . I went to my parents and drafted a divorce agreement . ( Thats the best course of action. I saw a post earlier describing a situation that is much more dangerous than mine involving allergens and an epipen. )

His face was like that Pikachu Meme when i served him . He didn't know why i was doing that because we were ""happy"".

So now a year has passed and my life was hell.  My Monster in law tried every dirty trick in the book to take my Daugther . To name a few :

* She accused my brother of molesting her
* She accused me of neglect
* She accused me of taking drugs and leaving them in reach of a toddler ( I take thyroxin for heavens sake !)
* She accused me of endangering my daughter by leaving random man in my house
* the list goes on

During this time the excuse of my ex was that i *broke his heart and i had to undertstand his mother. She only wants whats best for him.*

Luckily i got good representation and even got my daughter full time  minus some weekends or visitation . I could prove that my daughter was endangered by his mother.

So now to the advice part.

I knew that my ex needed to be permanently in my life because of my daughter. And i was learning to live with that . He was very cold with me because again.. i broke his heart .

Now 2 things have come together :

* My ex BIL got married to an African American woman, so ofcourse my ex MIL flipped
* I started dating again

my BIL is a great guy and he actually stood up for his wife ( !!! go figure it is possible). I stay in contact with him because we are friends and hewas a mediator and fought with his brother quite often .So my BIL actually stood up for his wife and my ex husband got his panties in a twist, my BIL basically opened his eyes how shitty he was being. And that their mom treated me the same way she treated his wife. And finally my dense ex started understanding.

They guy I am seeing is great . I have even met his parents and his mother is normal . She treats me like a human being and has invited me allready to many family functions and tries to make me and my daughter feel welcomed . My ex got wind from the situation trough a mutual friend and guess who is now flipping his shit?

He started bringing flowers and chocolate ( I don't even like chocolate!!!) to pick up our Daugther. He sends me cards and sms with hearts and who knows what .

Yesterday was the ""best thing"". My daughter was at my mothers place and i was at home with my boyfriend. He appears infront of my door crying and clutching my engagement ring begging me to come back.

I said no and that he should go away. He wouldn't and started demanding that i come out to talk to him. My boyfriend told him that he would call the police ,and in his pathetic fashion  he threatened to beat my boyfriend up.

I closed the door and let him pound sand .

Today he picked up my daughter for a day trip and when they came back my daughter was asking if i loved my boyfriend more than her .

Now I am at a loss to what to do. I allready told my daughter that it was imposible because my love for her is infinite and there is nothing bigger than infinite.

But now i know that my ex is trying to make my daughter hate me .I am at a loss because i won't use my daughter as amunition. But also....what the hell am i supposed to do??I will never return with that man but i can't take the father of my daughter. Do you guys have any advice?


Edit /mini update : thanks you all! I needed to vent and was feeling helpless and am so thankfull for you wonderful people.

I talked to my lawyer who confirmed that we could have a case for domestic violence by proxy. A social worker will be visiting us in the next few days to talk to my daughter about this.


Edit : because apparently people want to spin the world narrative on me.
I don't care if he wants me back I don't love him anymore and will never get back together with him
Staying for the sake of our daughter would not make sense as it has been proven that the kids grow up happier and divorced homes than unhappy homes.

I tried talking to my husband when we were still married and he would always brush it off. He would brush off everything his mother did. I complained to him and told him we needed go to therapy wich he declined.

He has his daughter on the weekends. The court gave ne majority custody because of his mother.

AITA for subjecting my boyfriend to my nakedess?,"I (32F) live with my boyfriend (35M) of 5 years. We live together in an awkwardly shaped apartment with a long, narrow living room and a tiny bedroom. As a result, our dresser is in the living room.

After work, I like to come home, greet my boyfriend who's usually relaxing on the couch, and change into my gym clothes. While I'm changing in the living room, we usually talk about our day. Well today, I started telling him about an annoying co-worker while I was topless. Out of nowhere, he abruptly stops me and curtly says, ""don't talk to me when you're naked"". I was really taken aback by this. Embarrassed, I went into the bedroom to dress in peace.

Angrily, I came out and asked my boyfriend why he suddenly had a problem with me being naked. Before I get into his reasoning, I will admit that I am naked quite a bit. For instance, after I shower I like to do a naked Kermit style dance to dry off in front of him. Anyway, his discomfort is that seeing me naked all the time makes it less special when we have sex. He even mentioned that this issue came up in Seinfeld and that Jerry would side with him. I don't know about this, I feel like I have a right to be naked, but I don't want him to feel uncomfortable either.

Anyway, should I let my fur flag fly or AITA??

UPDATE: Before I dive in, you guys really came through with the solid advice! Thank you! Ok, so after this incident I decided to cool off and go to the gym. When I got home my boyfriend sheepishly greeted me. I coldly said ""hi"" and sat on the couch to play on my phone. While I'm sitting, he walks over to me and without saying a single word, begins to start stripping! He gets butt naked, picks up my free weights and starts doing lunges, squats, bicep curls, you name it! I watched him in silence until we both couldn't take it anymore and started laughing. He then apologized, saying he doesn't have a problem with my nudity, he just doesn't like to have prolonged conversations when I'm naked. I understand where he's coming from, so we agreed that any conversation longer than 5 minutes will require a shirt. Tough, but fair.

Thank you again for your helpful comments! They were really thoughtful and made me think deeper about how I was making him uncomfortable. In terms of saying that me being naked all the time makes sex less special, he said it was a dumb comment that he only said in anger. I accept this.

I'm also a bit obsessed with all the Seinfeld comments. Jerry is absolutely an asshole and using him to argue your point is hilarious. Now Kramer on the other hand...

And thank you to everyone who supports my Kermit dance! I will confidently dance dry after my shower tonight. But for no longer than 5 minutes. I know the rules.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.,"Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

For the last 12 months I've been commenting on peoples posts, I've created my own posts. I haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

Last month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

Anyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, I'm still in my own little Truman show)

If you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

TL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn't notice. Since then I've spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/

Edit: So I've gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx

Edit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I'll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!

Please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I've been such an idiot for so long. It's ok to laugh with/at me :)

Edit 3: Reddit is awesome. I've missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.

I also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

Should I (24M) leave my gf (24F) over her weight?,"Hi, before you start thinking im shallow hear me out. Ive been with my gf for about a year and she is the kindest person ive ever met and I love her to bits. She is perfect in every way except one.

&#x200B;

She has gained alot of weight and is now obese. I have been trying for months and months to get her in shape and I know she wants to but shes just extremely lazy and full of excuses.

&#x200B;

It doesnt help that im abit of a fitness fanatic, I have asked her to come to the gym with me, she says shes too embarassed. Lets go for a run, same thing. Have u tried a vegan diet? no will power. I  found some cool workout videos u can do at home, never did it. Brought her a fitbit, doesnt use it. Asked her to count calories, says its too much effort. Asked her to record her weight every 2 weeks, scales ran out of battery, I found a cool subreddit (loseit), never went on it. She also lies about what she eats.

&#x200B;

Theres an excuse for everything. When I think of my future, I think of her suffering from health problems as a result and ultimately dying young because of this. Nobody wants their wife to die at 60 and life the rest of their lives alone. When I think of a perfect future, it is with her but a healthy version and im thinking of just cutting it off and saving myself the heartbreak in the future because I dont have much hope that she will change.

&#x200B;

You can call me shallow but part of this is the attraction side. Im not gonna sugar coat it but obese people just arnt attractive to me so right now im only with her for her personality. When she was smaller she was really pretty which is what made me first go up and speak to her, now I dont even recognise her. If you have any advice or comments I will be super grateful, thankyou

&#x200B;

Edit: I went to sleep when this had about 20 comments and i woke up to over a thousand! Thankyou for all your kind messages and stories. Im glad people understand where im coming from. I thought most people will be angry that I dare to question her weight and how u can be healthy and obese which im glad theres only a few comments like that which I just have to say you are dillusional!.

I am going to get her an appointment with a therapist soon, I wont explicitly say its a therapist but a sort of talk session about different problems you might face and a place to get things of your chest. I feel like the word therapist scares some people. Also whenever I see her im gonna tell her not to drive because we are walking. Alot of people mentioned sports too, I could buy a basketball and see if she will play with me. I wont make any harsh desicions now but in my mind I will give her 5 months to get into a reasonable shape. If I dont see any improvment then I know there is no hope and will leave her. Thanks again you lovely people, I will be reading the comments still :)

&#x200B;

Another Edit: I cannot reply to all your comments but I have read most of them! Some of your stories have been great to read. A quick update i decided to book her a therapy session for a few weeks time and told her about it. She took it really well. To all the people who are asking how much weight she gained, I dont know because she would never tell me her weight. I really hope this relationship survives because i litrally love her with all my heart but I shall know in a few months. I will make an updated post then if anyone is intrested too.",relationship_advice
TIFU by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.,"Well, fuck. 

Not a throwaway because I have no shame left to feel. 

TIFU by orgasming so many times I went blind in one eye. That's right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

Seriously, though. Last night I was trying to sleep (obligatory ""not technically today"") but failing miserably. I have bipolar disorder, I'm off my medication (that is a TIFU in itself), and I was in the early stages of a manic episode. For those who aren't batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. I tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my Mothman musical, and thinking about Al Gore. At about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, I decided I had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

[Enter stage left] lesbian porn. Here's the part where I mention how my clit is made of steel. I came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. For some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. Having finished the porn (which I actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) I decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. Now, whenever I'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, I always have to go completely under the covers. Unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where I live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. Super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? Anyway, for some reason I can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. Maybe Saudi Arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? Since this incident I've only slept for four hours. I'm losing my mind. 

Anyway, at this point I'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. After ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. My clit breathes a sigh of relief and I emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. My right eye is stinging a little bit, and I realise the acne treatment I'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. I grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

I'm sure you can see where this is going, but I certainly didn't. And now I could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. I wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. The weird angle I'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. For some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. I felt genuinely betrayed. Like, how dare you? YOU did this to me. This is YOUR fault. Et tu, Clite? 

Once my eye starts to swell up, I call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. Arguably the weirdest walk of shame I've ever done. 

I continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. The swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. My eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

Now I've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that I'll probably have to cancel. I've been wanting to bang this guy for WEEKS. Also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and I can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish I'm shit out of luck. 

TL;DR: I masturbated and now I'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

EDIT: Sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? This blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if I wrote it. Damn my unforgettable Mothman musical. Anyway, I did not cancel my dick appointment. I told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (Less endearing when I got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. I've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). Also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. Hallelujah.

EDIT #2: Clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. To clarify: I'm bi. Also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, I guess.",tifu
"AITA for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?","I'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. I mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'Anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. She embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. Personally, I have nothing against this at all. I am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. However, I do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. I don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

However, despite being a ""supporter,"" Anna regularly comments on my body type. For example, I always bring food for my shifts since I personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). Anna will often say things like, ""You should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""You look skinnier than last week. I told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" She'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if I was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that I look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" One time I was changing into my work shirt in the back and Anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" I have no idea what that even means but I doubt it was a compliment.

These hypocritical comments have pissed me off. I enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and I enjoy working out and staying toned. Anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. I don't think this is healthy. 

Finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy I kinda like came in to get some food and I was super excited to see him. He turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. Oh well. Anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""Maybe he's into curvier girls."" I basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. I asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. Then I told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (I called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

She called me insecure and told me I was being a rude bitch. It was reaching the end of our shift so I clocked out early and left so I didn't have to argue with her more. I was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. She said that I was right and all but that I was insensitive in the way I brought it up and suggested that I apologize. I'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for hiding my personal life at work?,"I'm in a little trouble at work because I've been sort of hiding my personal life. I've worked in this office for about nine years, working my way up. I'm notoriously private and also believe in a clear separation of work and home life. With that, I never, ever talk about home life. I'm not ashamed of my life I just don't like to discuss it at work. My coworkers enjoy talking about their personal lives and often include me. If I'm asked any questions I usually redirect or move on to someone else. In this manner, none of my coworkers knew I'm married, have twin daughters and a very active personal life.

We hired Melinda last year and she took it upon herself to become the office snoop. She spent several weeks getting as close to everyone as possible. However, she does this to seek out potentially useful information she can hold over peoples head. Try as she did, I never gave her anything. My coworkers view me as a sort of enigma.

They're hugely important and come before everything else but I'm not a sycophant and I enjoy the ten hours a day I'm at work when I get to be an adult and talk about things other than JoJo Siwa and the newest Jenndashian exploit.

Last week, Friday, Melinda came into work looking like the cat who got the goldfish. At lunch she announced to everyone that I am married with two daughters, a dog, and a nice house. I play softball, I kayak, and occasionally mountain climb and that I'm on Facebook. She couldn't see my posts however some of my photos are shared with others and therefore not private. I use a shortened version of my name (Ali from Alexandra) and my married name on FB so I'm not sure how she found me, unless she used WhitePages and put two and two together. I've already reported her to HR.

But the problem is, my coworkers are acting like this is a BFD. One of my friends said she's hurt that I don't trust any of them and hold them in ""such low regard"". I tried to explain that it's nothing against anyone, I just don't like discussing home at work and vice versa. I never bring work home. When I'm home that's time with my kids, or my dog, or my husband, or friends and hobbies. Heck, I chose to live an hour outside of the city in a small town just to avoid work when I'm not there. I've apologized if any feelings were hurt but my coworkers are now giving me the chill and won't talk to me unless it's directly about work. I honestly don't see the problem. I've never lied to them, I've never given them false info, I've never made up wild tales about my life. I'm still the same person I was, now they just know more about me than they did.

AITA?

ETA: I know this has been posted three times today. I didn't know Reddit was having trouble earlier with their servers and I thought it was the account I was posting from so I created a second throwaway and then a third because I never got confirmation the post was uploaded. I couldn't even get past the white screen with the little Reddit face spinning in the center. Those two posts actually have a little extra info in them. This one lacks the info because my patience wore thin.

ETA:  I don't have any sort of interesting update. HR brought us both in yesterday afternoon and asked us WTF is going on. I presented my side, as detailed above, Melinda gave her's: she basically said that she had been trying to get to know everyone and she had been having trouble getting to know me so she found my facebook in effort to find something to talk about with me and then she just informed everyone else. I asked my HR rep to pull up facebook and do a cursory search for my real name. There were several. Then I asked him to search my married name, or the one I go by on FB, ""Ali Smith"". There were enough for about six or seven scrolls on the mousepad. In any case, too many to count. I haven't touched my own page since I reported the incident. It was about thirty names from the top but like I said, my profile pic is my dog, not me, so she would have had to look a each thumbnail photo or view each account. I do have an Instagram page that's on private but I only have a few friends, mostly family members, under that same name. She found me night before last and friended me. Naturally I blocked her. HR gave her a reprimand for creating a negative work atmosphere. My rep wasn't sure why Melinda felt the need to blast my info for everyone and he called BS on her for claiming it was innocent. So that's that. That's probably all that's gonna come from it because my coworkers are now acting mostly back to normal. However, I took the advice from this sub and I'm making amends. They're all most receptive. I'm gonna learn to open up but not by much. But they know enough about me to know I'm not an automaton or anything.",AmItheAsshole

[RESOLVED NE] HOA tried to take my land,"So after 6 long months, everything been resolved. This is my final post regarding this, already asked my lawyer if I could post this and he said go ahead. 

So here's my last update:  

https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7go96c/ne_hoa_towed_away_my_car_and_built_a_chainlink/


So the HOA board got a lawyer to respond to my C&D and they requested a meeting ASAP with my lawyer present as well. I didn't want to go but my lawyer suggested me hear them out at atleast. At the meeting, I noticed there president and some of the higher ups were not there. 

The board had no idea what the hell was happening and their lawyer was just as confused as them. After I laid out my timeline of events they thanked me for my time accepted all the financial burden of replenishing my pond, missing car (couldn't locate it), and damages. 

I got checks for everything and got my pond restored back in April and didn't really think much of it. 

I found out a few weeks ago from the new HOA president. Turns out the old president, tresaurer and someone else had been stealing money from the coffers. They wanted my land to expand and put in a pool, clubhouse and etc just as I saw on their website. The old board fined everyone a ton of money to get all the cash together and buy my land. Instead they spent it on themselves. They needed my land somehow so they thought they could just take over the land I wasn't using.


Long story short, their entire plan fell apart after I fought back and brought to the other members of the HOA attention what they were doing. From what I've been told, they had to sell their house to pay back the HOA and have since moved away. The HOA has offered me market value for my land and I do plan on selling since I really don't use the land for anything and the money isn't bad.

I did not file any complaints with the Postal inspector or anything, since the situation resolved itself. I got a new project car and for those asking it was a '98 Supra with a bad engine. My new project is a '67 Fastback that I plan on restoring to look like Elanor. :)

She also called me about 100 times for our ""morning FaceTime call"" and I declined her. I wanted to tell her that I had a girl in my bed and we're eating pancakes but that's petty af so I didn't

"Public School Teachers are OVERpaid, not underpaid.","Very unpopular opinion that I have literally received death threats for. 

Public school teachers in the United States earn a median income around $56,000 per year.  This is far too HIGH.  

https://www.bls.gov/ooh/education-training-and-library/mobile/high-school-teachers.htm

https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/high-school-teacher/salary

https://www1.salary.com/Public-School-Teacher-Salary.html

I'm not saying what they do is not noble, important, or difficult.  I am saying they are paid too much compared to other professions.

1.  Public school teachers are paid through tax dollars under contracts negotiated by unions with the power to strike. This artificially inflates their wages and benefits.  (The purpose of a union). It's revealed in the numbers.  Private school teachers, who do not have the power to force a tax payer to pay more, earn far less.  Some estimates are as low as $37,000.  

https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Private_School_Teacher/Salary

Teachers Union Convention, NEA top official - It's not for the kids, it's for the power.

https://youtu.be/baM8N24K8kE

2.  The median HOUSEHOLD income in the United States is only about $62,000.  That means that ONE teacher's income is nearly equal to the median income of entire households, most of which contain two or more incomes.  

But wait Billy Mays, There's more. 

3.  Teachers are required by contract to perform their job only about 180 days per year.  Private sector non-education wage jobs have 260 work days per year.  Business owners work up to 365 days
- all net of holidays obviously for simplicity since Christmas and New Years etc. happen for everyone - 

Annualized pay to equal out the effort put in by private sector and self employed workers then reflects an equivalent of $89,500 and $125,700. 

And please, don't tell me ""Teachers work 16 hours per day 364 for little Johnnie doing lesson plans and grading papers.""  Stop it.  Third Grade long division has not changed for 2 centuries.  1 lesson plan per career can literally handle a lot of subjects - and I know teachers who do just that. 

Teaching is not easy, but it's not hard either.  And yes, before you say ""try it once and stand in my shoes"" - I have.  

4.  On average, teachers are not very good at what they do and take little to no responsibility for results.  They are more facilitators than professionals. 

""These kids get out of high school and can't even read.""  

Proficiency in reading, math, science and other subjects varies depending upon what is tested and at what point in the education process it's measured, and varies greatly from state to state and city to city, but reading proficiency is often as low at 40%.  Math often under 50%.  Half or more of our public school students are being pushed out into the world whether they are prepared or not.  Private schools do considerably better in every category across the board. 

It's because federal funding - for those sweet salaries and benefits - is tied primarily to graduation rates, not proficiency.  And when proficiency tests are proposed, teachers scream like a banshee that it's unfair to test teachers based upon whether their students have learned.  

You can peruse this trove of data if you like.  It's fascinating actually.  https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/index.asp?faq=FFOption3#faqFFOption3

""It's the parents, not us.""  

You'll often hear this in response.  And it's true, parents are extremely important in little Johnnie's life and success.  But that does not mean a teacher is without responsibility.  They are typically trained for at least 4 and up to 8 years post-secondary to figure out how to get little Billy the bully ready even when he's a dick and won't pay attention.  The gifted and smart kids are going to learn the material no matter what the teacher does or doesn't do, all she needs to do is competently facilitate for them.  Her job is to get slow witted Corky some knowledge because he can't learn on his own. 

5.  Schools are becoming prison camps.  For what we pay for, public schools are providing less and less benefit and more and more hazards.  I don't think it's because there were no Donnie the drug dealer and Billy the bully when we Generation Xers were growing up.  It's because school administrations have slowly changed the culture of schools to a more institutionalized authoritarian culture.  There is a growing attitude of contempt for students and parents.  Cops are everywhere.  Students have few if any rights.  The kids are treated with disrespect and 'zero-tolerance' policies that effect their lives and their personalities forever.  It gets worse each year. 

I do not see the same thing happening in private schools.  I believe it's because private schools have customers, and public schools have captives - and the cliche that ""teachers are overworked and underpaid"" has given them a generally bad overall attitude of smug superiority and entitlement.  They have become adversarial.  

https://youtu.be/sO_gKQUuISc

Like I said, I've had my life threatened for this opinion locally.  It's dogmatically accepted that teachers are heroes that are overworked and underpaid. 

Yet they work fewer days, earn more than almost half of entire households, have unions negotiating the best benefits in the country, the kids are not learning, the experience of being a student is increasingly miserable, and their own top representatives admit its not about the kids, it's about the power.

My (25 F) boyfriend (24 M) of 5 years just disclosed to me that he does not believe women should be allowed to vote.,"Update: Hi everyone, I had no idea that this post would gain this much traction. I'm sorry that I haven't been responding, I posted late-ish last night and have been at work today so I haven't had a chance to read the majority of the comments that have poured in. I am still at work so I won't have time until later to read through everything.
I wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. It has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt I have been facing. He really had me questioning this entire situation and whether I was overreacting or not. I am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. I can update again afterwards.
Thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. Even if my opinion isn't valid to him, at least it's valid to all of you!


I don't want to cause any political debates. If it's necessary for context: obviously I believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

I'm so confused, I don't know what to think. I'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but I just feel that I need some advice.

In the time I have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so I thought. Politics was never an issue between us at all. However he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are American) and that they should not be allowed to vote... He says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

I'm upset and I can't tell if I'm wrong to be upset about this because I know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now I just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. He has assured me that he still thinks that I should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

This is a person I have been with for almost 5 years. We've talked about marriage. I don't know what to think. In all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and I can't imagine my life without him in it. But this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

Am I wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? As his girlfriend am I supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though I may (strongly) disagree? I can't tell if I'm overreacting to this or not. The whole situation has made me feel terrible and I'm so confused.",relationship_advice

Not sure how to deal with my [37F] anti-vaxx husband [35M] since I want to get our kids vaccinated,"At first I assumed he would come around and realize it's the right thing to do.  We were both vaccinated as children, as were both of our families.

It's been 6 years. Six years since our daughter was born, and 3 1/2 years since our son was born. 

First, he said he wanted to wait until they were older, maybe 1 year, to ""let them develop before we add chemicals.""

At 1 year I pushed to vaccinate but was met with his ""uncertainty."" 

Today my daughter had a fever of 102.3, over 101.6 for more than 24 hours, and I decided to take her to the ER.  

Thankfully she doesn't have anything serious, but for more than 10 minutes the doctor laid into me about how important vaccines are for our children. 

He said all the things I've said to my husband, and more, and made me feel like shit. He explained that a 4 month old baby was hospitalized 3 days ago for meningitis, and lived even though he didn't expect him to survive.

I tried to explain that I agree, but I feel he didn't believe me that it was my husband's wishes I was respecting up until now.

He ended by saying, ""look, *my children are vaccinated.* ""

On the discharge paperwork it says: ""vaccination not carried out because of caregiver refusal"" under the diagnosis.

I look stupid because of my husband's ignorance.

I won't do this anymore. Although he is a sweet man with a kind heart, he is endangering our children.

Can I just take them myself?  We always go together....thus he's always there and freaks out if vaccines are mentioned so the doctor gives up.

What can I say so he won't go? How can I keep this form him, or should I tell him once it's done?

Reddit I need encouragement and suggestions what to do.

If I was in some kind of religious cult and asked for help to get out you would help me. Help me help my children this is no different.

WIBTA if I told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?,"So my situation is a little difficult so I thought I would confide in the good professional people of reddit. Couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. We haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. Towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" I mentioned something along the lines that I smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (This was hard for me to tell because my whole life I was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) We both laughed about it saying ""Just don't let mom find out"" The joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""I cheated on my wife..."" At first it didn't register until I saw his face and he was dead serious. I for one hate cheaters, but I try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. He begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. She would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. He told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. During this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. He told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. Few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. Pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. They've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (They have a kid) 
He told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

As stated before I hate cheaters and I've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. I know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. My heart tells me I have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because I've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. My brain tells me it's none of my business and I should keep my mouth shut. I don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. On one hand I betray my brother if I say something on the other hand I betray our close family friend because I know this secret and I don't say anything. I wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. So there it is, WIBTA if I said something?

TLDR: Brother Cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now I feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. WIBTA?

Tifu by accidentally proposing to my GF of 2 months,"So this just happened. Back story i had a GF of 6 years i was going to propose to, and as not necessarily superstitious i will not ""recycle"" an engagment ring even tho it cost what it did. I thought it was stolen or lost. It had been missing for close to 3 years. 

So what happened. In the proccess of rearranging my kitchen i decided to consolidate a few boxes of the same product (lipton tea) i had several boxes and was going to put them all into one. Simple enough i thought. 

Now with my new girl friend standing to my right i open the first box and holly mother of fucking pearl it cant be, but it is the ring box. This is where my thinking was holly shit i just found that ring, no way... hey babe check this out just found that ring i lost. Not really thinking a lot about it i open the box and turn to her. 

Seemed pretty simple i found a lost ring, hey look what i found.

And thats when she made a really awkward face started shaking and runs out of the room basicly saying no fucking way Oh My God no fucking way. At this point im like wtf was that about. When i walk around the corner to check whats wrong shes almost crying saying really too soon, not yet at least.

LIGHT BULB she thought i was proposing to her ( in what may be one of the strangest ways possible) but never the less she saw a ring being held out to her and freaked the fuck out. 

Hour latter trying to explain i wasent and it was a lost ring i had literally just found she and i are laughing our asses off.

Hey everyone! This is the daughter writing the update. My mom didn't know how to do an update post and asked me to write it for her. We're both here to respond to comments if you have any.

I saw that a few people asked what my aunt's opinion was after the verdict was given on this post! Here is the answer to that question: My aunt said that she had told my cousin from the beginning that excluding me was going to hurt my feelings and suggested to her that I be a bridesmaid instead of my mother. My cousin turned down this suggestion but would not say why. 

I also saw some people wondering if something had gone down between my cousin and me that I wasn't telling my mom. This is definitely valid question! The answer is no, she and I haven't had any problems prior to this (that I know of, at least). She has always been like a sister to me. If she ever had a problem with me or anything I've done I would hope she would tell me.

Another question I saw was about my relationship with my father. He and I have a very tense relationship due largely to some mental heath problems that he has. Prior to all of this I had confided in my cousin a lot about this. This made her decision to include him over me hurtful in a very poignant way.

After reading all of your comments and some more deliberation, my mom ended up staying in the wedding party. I appreciate her desire to stand up for me but I really did want my cousin's wedding to go smoothly (despite my feelings being very hurt). My mom respected my wishes. She is an amazing mom all around and I am lucky to have her in my corner. 

After the conversation I had with my cousin (described in the last post) I was on the fence about attending the wedding. I then heard from other relatives that she was concerned that I would ""sabotage the wedding"" if I were to attend. I found this comment to be bizarre and confusing. At this point I decided that it would be best to remove myself from the situation entirely. I told her that I wouldn't be attending and left it at that. It was a hard decision to make, but your reactions to the original post made me feel more confident in my choice.

The wedding did end up going smoothly. I heard from multiple sources that there was plenty of extra room in the bridal suite. I wish I could have been there with my family to support her on her big day. She and I have both been part of each other's major life milestones for as long as I can remember. I still haven't figured out why I was the only one excluded but I have come to the conclusion that she and I must not be as close as I had always thought we were. At this point I'm not sure that I want to be. Your feedback on the original post played a large part in me realizing that.

Thanks to everyone for reading and for all of your responses! We got great insight from everyone who commented (especially those with different perspectives from our own). If you guys have any more questions feel free to comment!",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling my boyfriend I don't want a penis?,"This whole argument is really weird to me. Basically, I'm on my period and my boyfriend said offhand he was glad he didn't have to deal with that and said something along the lines of, ""I bet you wish you had a dick."" To which I responded, ""no, not really."" 

He seemed kind of taken aback by that and pressed the issue of exactly why I did not want to have a dick and I basically told him male genitals seemed really uncomfortable and awkward to possess, like I don't want some meat and a nut sack just chillin in my britches. Hard pass. He got weirdly offended by this and said I was being sexist??? I told him that I observe him scratching his nuts or rearranging his junk multiple times a day and that it would make me crazy if I had to constantly attend to my genitals like that. He got so mad about this to the point he stormed off to let me ""think about"" why what I said was so upsetting. 

I don't get it though? Not 5 minutes earlier he was trashing vaginas and periods, but that's okay, for reasons? Y'all help me out lmao

HELP!!! MY FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND CALLED HER BY MY NAME DURING SEX!!!!,"Hi, my (20F) friend (21F) is no longer my friend as of like a few hours ago because her boyfriend (21M) called her my name during sex. I've been so cooperative and supportive through all of her relationship. I used to date her boyfriend years ago and he treated me like royalty and would take me out everywhere and she was my friend through it all. About a year ago I guess they hit it off and I decided to distance from him (we were still friends) out of respect for her. 
She constantly vents to me about ME and about how he doesn't treat her half as good as he treated me and she doesn't understand it. I feel terrible but there is nothing I can do, I don't understand it either. I've always been aware he had a hard time getting over me but I guess a couple hours ago he called her by my name during sex. She blew up my phone about it and somehow took it out on me. Reminder; I haven't spoken to him outside of when I'm with both of them together in a year!!! 
He has called her by my name before but it's always been brushed off as a simple mistake. 
She insists we cannot be friends and I tried to apologize even though all of this is out of my control.
Advice??


UPDATE: after going through ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS (yes I read all of them) I feel there is some stuff to clear up. She asked me for permission to date him and I gave her the go ahead which is why him and I distanced. It was a mutual agreement, he also said that it would be best if we distanced for her sake. Our interactions are minimal at get togethers or whenever I go to see her because THEY LIVE TOGETHER. he has never been flirty or creepy towards me so I do believe it's an honest mistake. As for the comments that state that I ""am clearly not over him"" that relationship died years ago and I am with somebody happily. I want to take your advice and just ""drop them"" but this is years of friendship I want to save...

UPDATE #2: First of all thank you guys so much for the replies and help, you guys have, if anything, reassured me I did nothing wrong. I was not too sure before. I am also aware that this may not be a friendship worth saving as she has always been this way, always had to be right and I have always put in more effort. However, I do not mean to make this about something else but after high school I have been left with 2 friends, one of which was her. It's hard to think about my life being more empty than it already is and I feel like every single year I have less and less people in my life even though I am TRYING SO HARD to keep them around. I have been there for her and friends with her for 10 years and never through her fuckups even thought about ending the friendship. I'm just left wondering, once again, what it is about me that made everyone disappear after high school. Again, sorry if I'm turning this into something else. It's not my intention but the need to save the friendship is deeper than just ""oh I just want to be friends""",relationship_advice

It was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that I come clean to Sam. I did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. I asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

His cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. He told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. They wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

He then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. He told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

Sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

Well I think it's working. Sam and I have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night I notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. Sam and my grandpa are both WW2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with Sam. 

I decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. I got there before Sam, and I could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought I had come alone_. They asked where Sam was, when he was coming etc. Then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived.

I told her that if she wants a ride home she'll have to listen to my music. I then unplugged her phone and started driving. Then she gets bold and while I'm driving unplugs my phone and starts playing her music again. So I pullover and tell her to get out. She kinda sat there and looked confused but after repeating myself a few times she hopped out. I wasn't expecting the backlash from my stepmom when I got home. She was pissed and ""threatened"" me with calling my dad and telling him about my reckless behavior. She went on to call me an ego maniac and other names. When my dad got home it started a argument between them because he thinks I was justified. From my POV she's a 7th grader that should understand that her actions have consequences. I understand it is a little thing but I gave her a warning and she didn't respect it.

(Update) My(23F) sister(25F) and friends(20s) talked about how I'm not good enough for my BF(25M). They don't know I heard.,"

Hey everyone, first of all, I'd like to thank everyone for the messages and comments on my last post, it truly helped me get off the bed and face the day.

I showed my BF the last post bc I just didn't know how I could say it. He was very sad and disappointed but being asexual he has had his fair number of assholes, but he mostly felt angry for me and agreed with the majority of advices that I should confront her. We decided a letter would be the best choice since I actually write a lot of letters and it's not direct confrontation.

I like writing letters for moments(like, letters for when the person is sad, happy, angry, scared, ect) so I do have some techinique but this was, with no doubt, the hardest things I ever wrote. I decided to go for the simple and blunt. Told her I heard what they said about me and while I was willing to work on our relationship, I needed distance from her and this whole situation.

I talked with my landlord(lady?) and she was super sweet and had no problem breaking the lease, I offered to find someone to take up my place but apparently she has someone that could use the room so that's cool

I intended to pack and leave the letter on her bed but she came home early and caught me. I basically said fuck it to myself and told her I heard them saying I wasn't good enough and calling me names.

First she tried to deny, which I wasn't having it, then she tried to justify and say I was overreacting but I just stared at her. Then she finally started to apologize and cry. At that moment I actually thought we might be able to save the relationship but then she started making herself the victim. The main points were

1- I just can't understand how hard it is to be pretty(not even kidding)

2- I don't understand how she feels bc I'm used at not being the best

3-It's not fair I get a gorgeous BF, who is completely out of my league while she's single

4-She feels embarassed when we go out together and she has to tell people that my BF is actually mine, not hers

5-She knows asexuality doesn't exist and we're doing this just for attention.

I just kinda froze, I wish I had said something but I couldn't open my mouth. She then said she was going out to ""recover from our traumatic conversation"" and left. 

I just packed the rest of my things and left the letters on her bed. 

I'm currently at my BF's place but I'm looking for a free room that is not super far from my job.

I also wrote and sent letters to my ""friends"" a and then blocked their social media/contacts. I'm certain they'll find a way to approach me as we work close but I can't give a fuck.

Besides all of that, last friday I had dinner with my parents, I gave them an edited version of what happened(bc I don't wanna talk about my sex life) and that I broke the lease/blocked my friends. They said I shouldn't be angry bc it was true and that the first time they met my BF they thought I was playing a prank. My dad then started saying I was veing selfish by breaking the lease and, I shit you not, betraying my sister trust and that you don't do this with family.

So yeah, I've been ignoring them since this happened, as well as my sister.

Overall, I'm fine, I actually feel more tired than angry or sad


TL;DR: talked with my BF, it went well. Talked with my sister, didn't go well. Moved out. Talked with my parents, they said I'm selfish

[UPDATE] GF and I (26M/F) got into a huge fight over a keyboard,"[Previous post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bqh813/gf_and_i_26mf_got_into_a_huge_fight_over_a/)

Short EDIT at bottom.
&nbsp; 

We met earlier tonight and sat down to talk. I was somewhat prepared to end things with her, so I suggested we meet at her place, so that I could bail if things went south...and they did.

&nbsp; 

Even though I thought I made my post as anonymous as possible, one of my GFs coworkers figured out who the post was about (GF's age, working HR [which I mentioned in a comment], same computer problems, dating a programmer, etc) and sent it to my GF. The reason she wanted to meet early was because she was FURIOUS that I had made the post, 'airing our dirty laundry.' In a sense, I guess she was right, because at least on person had figured it out. My GF never used Reddit so I figured I was safe.
There's a strong chance she'll read this one as well, lol.

&nbsp; 


Anyway, she immediately began berating me, telling me that I made her look bad in the post and lied about the details of our argument to get people on my side. I asked her to point out ANY part of it that wasn't true, or where I had lied. Long story short, she couldn't point to a single thing. I definitely raised my voice when I told her that if she looked bad, it's only because of her actions. I told her I only made the post to get some perspective on the matter. The post was 100% accurate and she knew it. 

&nbsp; 

She began to tear up and asked me if I really was considering leaving her over the keyboard. I asked her if she understood that this WASN'T ABOUT THE KEYBOARD. It was about the way she acted towards me when I was trying to do her a favor. She stayed silent and didn't answer. I asked her what had prompted this outburst, if everything was OK with her. I asked if anything had happened with her friends, parents, or at work that was upsetting her and may have lead to this.

&nbsp; 

She got really defensive, asking ""Are you calling me crazy?"" and ""Do you think I'm unstable?"" I had no idea where she was going with this. I told her I wasn't calling her crazy, but that she had to understand that I was quite confused about how she was acting, and that there had to be a reason for it. 

&nbsp; 

We talked in circles for a bit, and I tried to pry it out of her. I still don't know what caused all of this, because she simply wouldn't tell me. When I realized our conversation was going nowhere, I finally asked her if we were going to have an adult conversation, or if this was the hill she was willing to let the relationship die on. She asked, ""What do you want from me?"" and I said, ""I want an apology.""

&nbsp; 

I'm getting tired of typing so I'll wrap this up quickly. She was absolutely unwilling to apologize. She thought that my ""betrayal"" of posting about this was far worse than her initial behavior was. We talked for about 5 more minutes before I told her that I don't even care anymore. I told her this whole thing was exhausting, as she wasn't willing to help us get to the bottom if this. That we should just break up. I didn't waste any time making my way to the door.

&nbsp; 

As I was leaving, she asked if I wanted the keyboard back. She didn't ask to be nice; she was definitely trying to get on my nerves. I could tell by her tone of voice. I told her she could keep it as long as she promised never to call or text me again.

&nbsp; 

I've been getting TONS of not-so-nice messages from her friends (which finally prompted me to delete my FB). She obviously told her friends some false version of the story which made it seem like I really did leave her over the keyboard. I couldn't care less, as I'll never be seeing any of them again.

&nbsp; 

We only dated for ~4 months, so in the end, I don't feel terribly heartbroken. Mostly just relief that it's over. But...also confusion. Still have no idea why she acted out.

&nbsp; 

TL;DR: She wouldn't apologize or tell me what was wrong. After an exhausting conversation, I decided to end it.

&nbsp; 

**And to the people who had some unkind words towards me because I use a Razer keyboard: Pound sand, dorks. I like what I like.**

"TIFU by putting a rock in my ear, then leaving it for roughly 13 years.","Bit of context; I was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. I'm 26 now. 

Well it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad's side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and I had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. It's where I got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?

While I sat amongst rubble and dirt, I had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.

Again, I wasn't bright. 

Well. I drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.

That said, I flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly I can't remove it. Not a single adult was even aware I was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.

So when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would've beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.

I lost my mind.

My dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. Probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. Whatever really.

Either way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that I was overreacting.

Okay. Sure.

Let's skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and I'm in highschool.

This is where the real fun begins. Equalbrium (Equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. I could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. Plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. Was a nightmare, really.

I get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that ""imaginary rock"" I had long ago forgotten.

All I hear is scrapes.

Scrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh'sh.

I'll admit, I immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn't been told up until now. That's another topic entirely.

Well wouldn't you know, though? The doctor said I was faking, examined my ear, and said I just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. Right. It was probably June at the time.

My mom didn't really believe him, but I decided ""balls to it. Let's get some Hydro-Perox!"", because fuck hospitals really.

Skip along the years a bit more, I'm 18 and I know for a fact there is something In-My-Fucking-Head. I'm losing it. So I hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, ""There's definitely blockage. I'm not sure if it's a rock, but I can certainly try to help.""

So this Professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of Scissor-Hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. It was audio torture, hands down. Rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.

The end results? ""You'll need to see a specialist"", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler's nasal cavities.

I'll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.

The sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and I began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when I reflect back.

Let's time jump one last time. I'm 22, couple months away from 23, I have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. Great.

But now, out of the blue, I'm losing Hand-Eye coordination. Well damn, you know? I attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.

I lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that I could dig this chunk of earth out myself.

Three different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. But that last one was phased from the situation immediately.

This was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and I locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.

Eventually the rod's end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. In an instant I froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.

Jackpot.

Now, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.
The pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like I was passing a kidney stone from my skull.

All in all, 2/10. Wouldn't do again.

But now it's totally out and I have it put away in a ziplock bag.

I had no real recovery issues I guess. As soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. Now it just rings occasionally.

My balance won't ever be the same I feel, but it's fine enough as is. Otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, I have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and I get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.

Not a bad trade out.

**_EDIT_**: For everyone calling me an idiot, trust me I know. For everyone concerned about my follow through, it was 3 years ago and I've been to the hospital between then and now for basic check-ups and have mentioned the stoned-ear before. It's fine. This is why I can laugh it off.

My (21M) girlfriend (21F) is on vacation and spent the night at some random guys house,"Alright I did not want her to go on this trip but she insisted that she wasn't gonna cheat on me or do anything stupid. And I couldn't control her, I could either be angry or be okay with it so I decided to just act chill and be okay with it. She said it was only girls and they were going to Miami for innocent fun. Drinking and dancing and no guys allowed. I believed her but I am needy and I love her so every morning while she was gone, we would FaceTime for a bit, just say good morning and stuff. I would miss her. 

She was out having fun but she'd still FaceTime me every morning and I loved that. I looked forward to seeing her. I FaceTimed her this morning and she kept declining it and I texted her asking her what she was doing that for. She said she just didn't wanna talk because she looked ugly and I was very confused since I don't care about that. So I kept calling and she finally picked up and she was with one of her girl friends eating breakfast in bed with some random Italian looking guy. She tried to purposely hide him from the camera but I'm not dumb. I asked her who that was and she immediately was like ""listen nothing happened, I didn't do anything, so don't yell at me. We met him last night at the club, he's nice and let us spend the night and he slept on his couch, nothing happened so don't worry."" I was pissed off because she was implying that I'd be overreacting if I got mad that she was in bed with another guy but I continued with our morning talk. She's still on her trip and I don't know what to think. Does it seem like she was lying",relationship_advice
Alcohol is an absolutely terrible drug and should not be glorified in society.,"Seriously, what other drug can you DIE from withdrawal? How often do you hear the latest car crash due to alcohol intoxication? It's a mind altering substance that frequently makes people aggressive, unaware (Which people use to get others very drunk just to use as a grounds of rape), uncoordinated, ect.

Even if I also enjoy a beer or two once in a while, and I don't shame people for enjoying what they enjoy. You do you.

But the fact that society as a whole is constantly shoving it into media, advertising, and stores without recognizing the very real dangers of it is bewildering to me.

Edit: Wow! This blew up, thanks for my first silvers!

Edit 2: Sorry for not being aware of the lethal withdrawal of benzo's I will keep that in mind, thanks guys!

My(39m) daughter (17f) wants me to sleep in her room because she broke up but I suspect something mire to it.,"Edit: The title should be more to it not mire.

I know this is actually a really weird situation. I'm sorry I do my best to raise her but I know that I can never fill the void her mother left when she passed away.

Yesterday out of the blue, my daughter asked me to sleep in her room. When I asked her if everything was alright she started crying and told me that she broke up with her boyfriend and she didn't want to talk about it. She told me she doesn't fesl safe anymore. 

I just didn't push the issue and slept in her room. She didn't want to talk today either. I think something's really wrong, because we are super close and she tells me everything but reluctant to talk about this. What do I do?

Update:  Hey guys I sincerely thank everyone here for showing their support and giving me some much needed advice. I just wanted to update this. So, my sister came over and took her out so they can have some alone time together. It turns out that she broke up with her boyfriend because he's been cheating on her. Now he's just being and idiot and bombing her with messages and calls. She just blocked him. But he's basically threatening her with ""consequences"" for breaking up with him. ",relationship_advice

[UPDATE] Employer didn't pay several of us for a day when the company was closed. You guys helped me and several others get paid. Thank you!,"So after some research and still not quite understanding the law here in Florida, I made  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/afjeis/im_an_exempt_employee_in_the_state_of_florida_my/) a little while ago.  The answers were right along the lines of what I was thinking and gave me the confidence to go to my employer and demand payment.  I was a little worried about retribution, but I figured the law was on my side so wth?

Not only did they cut me a check, but 7 other employees who were affected like this were paid as well.  No signs of retribution either.  It turned out (at least this is what I'm being told, so who really knows?) that the HR manager misinterpreted the law.  Once this person read it again, they started to have doubts themselves, then contacted our corporate lawyers who told the HR manager that we must be paid.

Tricky areas with consent in my relationship.,"Hi everyone!! 

I'm a 17 year old girl stuck in a bit of an uncomfortable mind space. I have a 19 year old boyfriend and we've been best friends since I was 13. We started dating when I was 15, and started having sex pretty much as soon as I turned 16. So, he's a very significant part of my life and has been for a very long time. 

He is kind and patient. He's funny, and we like the same video games and places to go. We have fun and he cares for me a lot. 
He makes me feel loved and sexy. He makes me feel wanted. I love being around him and I care about him so much. 

However, there are a few sexual situations that have made me a bit worried. I haven't been able to discuss them with any real life friends as I really don't want to disrespect my boyfriend or tarnish his reputation. 

These are a few examples of the awkward sex times: 

- he fingered me in the butthole when I asked him not to. He initially asked if I wanted him to pop a finger in, to which I adamantly said no to, and he put it in anyway. I told him to stop and to get out but he just kept fingering me. I froze and he finished and afterwards I told him how I didn't want him to and he joked about it. He continues to do it in sex. 

- he came inside me when I asked him not to. I have an IUD so I'm usually totally fine with having him cum inside me but I had a new one placed and my gynaecologist told me to use condoms while my body adjusted. We compromised and agreed on the pull out method. When he was about to cum, he asked me what I wanted, and I requested he pull out. Then he asked again and I reaffirmed it. Then he kept having sex with me before saying that he was cumming inside me. I asked him to pull out but he just kept at it. I cried after sex. He made jokes about it afterwards. I brought it up a few days later and told him it upset me and he said he felt like a real piece of shit for it and I ended up comforting him. 

- said I didn't want to have sex when he woke me up at 3am for it, as I felt sick. He then got quite upset with me until I sort of felt like I had to say yes to avoid him being angry with me or him having issues with me? We fucked even though I felt like I was going to spew and he knew how poorly I was. 

- wanted to do anal. I didn't want to. Got me really drunk to try it. It hurt and I asked him to stop. He asked me to keep trying. I said it hurt. He stopped. 

These are a few examples. I'm not sure how well my semi illiterate brain is at communicating these events but I've just sort of been worrying about them.

I tend to get a bit anxious during sex because it feels very out of my control. I feel like he could do anything and if I said no, it wouldn't really matter. This is such a frustrating way to feel because he's such a good and kind lover.

He's so caring towards me particularly when I'm dealing with the symptoms to a chronic illness I have, and tries hard to make me happy. 

We get along so well and I really want to be a good partner sexually for him. 

Should I be more open sexually? Should I let him try more things? 
If it's not an issue with me, how should I communicated it to him? 
He knows that the sex when I was sick made me feel pressured and that it upset me that he came inside me when I requested he didn't. He doesn't know that the fingering thing made me feel a bit sad. Is it worth bringing up again or should I just be more firm?

Please help! I've no idea if I'm not being good enough and I don't want to hurt him. I need advice! I don't have anyone else to turn to about it.  

TLDR: my boyfriend is amazing and I love him but sex gets a little bit sad for me sometimes. Am I doing something wrong?

AITA for telling my new neighbours that I've been trapped in a basement for a week after she told me not to check my mail box on weekends?,"I've been away since Thursday, house sitting for my mum, and it's currently Sunday afternoon where I live.  Here, mail doesn't deliver on weekends, they only do that Monday to Friday, which means I had 2 days worth of mail in my mailbox. 

My 30 something year old neighbours moved in on Friday when I wasn't here, and she was in her front yard when I was collecting my mail. She goes ""Don't check your mailbox on weekends. They don't deliver on weekends. So don't check it."" (In a rude Karen voice, if you know then you know.) Already, I know we're not going to have a good neighbour relationship, and I'm hungover and can't be bothered dealing with her shit, so I said ""I know, it's just I've been kidnapped in the basement for a week so I had to check the mailbox."" I don't have a basement, barely anyone does in my country. 

She seemed shocked, but it was an obvious joke with my overly sarcastic tone. Then we both went inside and that was that. About 25 minutes later, the police knocked on the door thinking I was held captive in my basement which I don't have, so I explained to them what I had said and they just laughed and left.

Just before, I was putting rubbish in the bin and she came out and called me a c*nt for making her think I was kidnapped

AITA?

TIFU by going down a Reddit rabbit hole.,"This didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and I bought a new car. I was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. Don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

I came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse Reddit while I'm taking care of my business. Most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. I can't remember what sub I was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. Before I knew it I was reading about ""The Donkey Show."" Yes that one. Some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. I wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so I just kept reading.

Someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how The Donkey Show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. Midget porn. I thought, ""What the hell, I've never seen this sort of thing before."" So I clicked.

As weird as it sounds, I clicked out of curiosity......I swear. What I saw was exactly what I expected to see. This specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. After a minute or so, I had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub I was in.

I finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. I get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

She was taking a while, so I grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. My wife comes out and gets in the car. Immediately she says, ""What the hell is this?"" I put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. On the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". I had never had a car with this feature before, so I was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. I knew I was screwed. It felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so I could change what was displayed on the screen.

After about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks I have a thing for little people. Before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. All I could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. Before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. I'm pretty sure I'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. Yay me...

She said to me one day, ""I know you won't leave me for another woman, but I'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

I doubt she will ever let this one go...

TL;DR I went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.

Edit: Damn! I fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, You guys are awesome! I'm glad you got a kick out of my mishap.

Edit2: Just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while I was pleading my case, we kept it very G rated.

AITA for not wanting to interact with my biological children?,"Back in 98 and 99 i donated sperm to my cousin and his wife. He had been left sterilized by his chemotherapy treatments and he and his wife were devastated. They asked me as I was his only Male relative of the same age and I agreed. The contract stated that I was relieved of all parental and monetary duty. After his kids were born I told them that if they chose to tell them the truth I would never be a part of there lives as I was starting my own family at the time and he seemed to understand.

I haven't seen him or his kids for over 10 years now as I've gone no contact with the family for my own reasons. Today both of his kids reached out to me. They both told me that they know I'm their real dad and want me to meet with them. I respectfully declined and told them that while they are biologically mine, I'm not their dad. Since then I've been getting texts and calls from the family telling me im terrible. Both of his kids seem to be devastated for some reason and really want to meet me and are acting like I'm rejecting them.

Am I wrong here? Like, I'm not really their dad, that's my cousin. I've tried to reach out to figure out what's going on but no one will tell me.",AmItheAsshole
AITAH for letting my coworkers quit because I got fired?,"A regular offered me $100 to take a shot with him, he has been drinking at the bar I worked at for over 10 years, I worked there for 4 years. I made a shot with sour mix and cranberry to match the color of his so he thought I was taking one. I just want to make extra money.

My manager happened to see this on the cameras. There is a strict no drinking policy at this bar for bartenders on the clock, and it's a new manager who is trying to show her authority so she made an example of me and fired me.

There is no way to prove there wasn't booze in my shot, I saw the footage and with the liquor gun we have right next to the pop gun there is no way to prove I didn't put liquor in that shot.

I honestly don't and didn't care enough to argue with her about it. I'm about to start a new job since I graduate from school after this semester and am not to concerned about my future in bartending.

I trained basically every new person at this bar, and I was honest with them that I was fired in our work group chat. They all started saying if you got fired for that we don't want to work here either. They were all saying bad things about the manager and how they want to screw the whole bar over by all quitting at the same time.

I told them that our new manager is balls to the walls. I said I'm going to be just fine, but not to make my same mistake and drink ANYTHING out of a shot glass because she is that concerned about it. I also told them to think for themselves and do whatever they need to when it comes to their jobs.

I then let my anger overtake me and I said ""if you want to find a job where you don't have to be constantly looking over your back and have to be worried about an insane manager find different bartending and serving jobs. You're all capable people that don't deserve a psycho watching over you when you've put good time into a work place."" I basically contradicted myself. 

I feel like I went over the top, my sister said I should've kept my mouth shut. But I explained the whole situation to the old manager, who taught me the ""mix things together to look like booze so people don't feel rejected when they buy you shots trick"". She thinks it's crazy the new manager won't trust me after training so many people in and my old manager loves me.

My old manager quit because she was moving away with her fianc√©, but she told the new manager that I was trustworthy and I thought the new manager would have some trust considering I was basically running the bar when she came in. 

Whatever the case, AITAH for letting a lot of employees quit on my behalf? Because as of now 7/10 bartenders where I was fired from are planning a group quit. I don't want the bar to close, but I want my manager to realize that she messed up...",AmItheAsshole
Somebody stole my identity to pay for their entire pregnancy - FL,"While vacationing in Key West, FL in February 2018, I was robbed of a backpack containing (among other things) my passport, my California drivers license, and my health insurance cards. I reported it to the proper state and federal agencies, and was certainly pissed, but did not really dwell on it. 

About six months later I start getting collection notices for various healthcare facilities for obstetric services. So I call them up to dispute, right? Surely a mistake. But they have my health insurance info, a copy of my (stolen) drivers license. All of the health info is in my name. Apparently I'm now 4mos pregnant and have been going to every sonography clinic in the Gainesville area on sometimes a weekly basis, to get sonograms of my healthy baby girl. I'm disputing bills left right and sideways for months from hospitals, OBs, general practitioners, geneticists, sonography, even ERs, when I receive a whammy of a \~$15,000 bill for fucking labor and delivery, and a week long NICU stay for a baby girl. 

In reference to those who are owed money, either nobody is believing me that it's not me or nobody's wanting to actually deal with it. They keep telling me that I need to physically come meet with them, which is fair I suppose, but I live in California and I work, so it's not like I can just hop on over to a random part of Florida and tour a bunch of healthcare facilities. I have neither the money nor the vacation time for that. 

I reached out to the local police where I live, who are apparently unwilling to do anything but take a single report and then never follow up ever. I was unable to file a report in Florida, Key West citing the fact that they wouldn't take a report over the phone and Alachoca (sp?) citing the fact that it was ""a civil issue"". I reached out to my insurance company, and they dropped me citing fraud--I didn't think to reach out to them for quite some time, and apparently they were pissed about that. I have no idea if they're investigating anything on their end or not. I reached out to the credit bureaus and froze my credit, and let them know as well. 

At this point, I'm nearly 40k in debt from this garbage, my credit is in the toilet, I'm in debt and financially hurting myself from unrelated medical bills I now have to pay out of pocket. I'm losing my mind at this point and I don't know what to do.",legaladvice
TIFU by connecting to my housemates Bluetooth speaker while she was having sex,"This happened yesterday but I didn't really know how to explain it until know.

It was my university's homecoming this weekend, so everybody was getting super drunk and just having a good time. During the day, my one housemate told me she was gonna be bringing someone home that night which I was totally fine with.

By the time she brought him over, I was in my bed trying to fall asleep. Her room is right beside mine so I was already thinking that I would be able to hear them, but I just figured they would try to be quiet. Once they got to her room, I could hear the bed creaking a couple minutes after. Me being tired and wanting to drown out the noise, I decided ""I'll just put on my Bluetooth headphones so I can't hear them."" Now usually my phone auto-connects to my headphones, but this time was different. I saw that my phone had connected to something, but didn't bother checking that it was my headphones.

I opened Instagram for a nice nightly browse, only to find out that the first video on my timeline wasn't playing audio. I thought my phone volume was low so I turned it all the way up. I was genuinely confused but began to hear a faint noise through the wall. By the time I realized my headphones weren't playing audio, it was too late; the Monsters Inc. theme started playing extremely loud from the other room. I promptly disconnected my phone and I hear a bang on my wall following a scream of ""LEGOGH\_, IS THAT YOU FUCKING WITH MY SPEAKER?!?"" I was speechless, I didn't say anything because I couldn't believe what had just happened.

It turns out that earlier in the day, I had connected to her speaker to play music and that's what my phone auto-connected too. After the guy left her room, I tried to explain to her what happened but she is convinced that I intentionally did it. They didn't even finish having sex because I killed the mood, and now she's extremely pissed off at me.

TLDR; accidentally connected to my housemates Bluetooth speaker while she was having sex and I watched a meme with the monsters inc. theme in it

EDIT: she isn't mad anymore, my other housemates brought it up last night and we all had a good laugh

TIFU by honey dicking my wife after she found my used condoms...NSFW,"Well brethren, I too wanted to partake in the great Coconutting frenzy. Today was my day off and was also my wifes longest day of work. It should be mentioned shes on her period, and sex is out of the picture for her. I havent busted a nut in roughly 4 days, and the idea of penetrating a milky coconut somehow thrilled me after reading the whole coconut-fucking-bonanza today.

I went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. After getting home, I uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. Once the hole was set into place, I expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. Once I got a good fit after doing a ""test run"" I found the hairs to be a little too much. I shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. The preparations were made, the mood was set, and I opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.

Fast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. All is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. I knew I fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers I had used. Aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. I told her I cheated on her with a coconut. .. It took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove I didn't have anyone else over and I simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. She was furious and I tried to console her by saying I'd never cheat on her with anyone..Just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. I'm not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/

TL;DR : Fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought I was cheating on her, had to fess up.

My (16m ) gf (17f) is 8 months pregnant with my daughter. Is my life actually over?,"Ok so I'm trying to make the best of a not so good situation. My gf who I've known for basically forever (been official since I was 14) is having my baby. Everyone especially my parents keep telling me I fucked up big and my life is over. They say I'm a loser and I'll never get anywhere in life. They say I'll never be happy again. How true is that?

I keep telling myself there's gotta be good things about babies otherwise people wouldn't keep having them since lots have them in purpose. 

I'm pretty much freaking out at this point. I have a fuck ton of mixed feelings about the whole thing. Obviously I don't want to be a dad BUT Im gonna be. So it is what it is. 

My parents are being difficult and not making things easier, in fact making it worse. Since I told them she was pregnant they said since I'm making adult decisions I now have adult responsibilities. They make me pay rent, part of hydro/cable/internet/water etc. I have to buy my own food and anything I need. I have a part time job but they now take the entire paycheque and are insisting I'm in the negative each month and owe them a couple grand. I have legit not been able to buy a single baby thing cuz of them.

I desperately needed shoes but since they take all my money I had none. I was wearing little bros shoes since he's cool but they're too small. Gfs parents bought me a new pair since I got an infected toenail from being squished. I don't want to owe them too, JC.

Anyway. I'm leaving home once school is done in June. Gf's parents said I won't have to pay them rent as long as I help with the baby and contribute with that.

My parents say they'll sue me for the money I owe them. Can they? When I get mad they just say I'm an adult and I get adult consequences now.

[UPDATE] Am I in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?,"EDIT: his friend messaged me and said I had no right to ""make"" my boyfriend tell on him and refuse to see him. I haven't replied but this does show me my boyfriend is trying 

When my boyfriend got home I told him we had to talk, he agreed. I was going to tell him how messed up this was and I am telling his friends wife but he talked before me.

Turns out I don't need to tell her because he already did. She was upset and asked him to never contact her or her husband again, so I won't know where that side is going.

He apologized and said it was a drunken mistake but he knows that doesn't make it right or hurt me less. We had talked about 3-ways before with women and he didn't think I minded, but now understands I didn't agree. He said he never thought he'd do something like that and he attacked me so much when I confronted him because he knew he was in the wrong but didn't want me to think of him as that guy. He was completely remorseful and I even saw him cry for the second time in 3 years. He said he thinks maybe it was some drunken pride thing over not being able to do much with me. This is because he does have some erectile dysfunction problems and I have had to help him with his self esteem as he would often say ""I just want to be able to please you"" when we could only have sex once every few months 

Even so, he went to his parents for now. We had moved to a new state together two years ago where they live but I don't really know anyone. I'm looking at plane tickets to my hometown. 

Until this incident we have had a perfect relationship. We always hung out and had great times. Only once did we ever have a huge fight, little disagreements but nothing crazy. He did everything he could no matter how annoying or hard to help my mental illness. He wanted to pay for me to go back to school. He believed in me and supported me when I started my writing. He helped me come to terms with my abuse and move on. All the nights he stayed up with me while I cried.

I wish this never happened 

I don't know if we'll get back together but he's giving me my space and being respectful. I definitely need to be away from him for awhile and think about this. He says he'll give me all the time I need and if I can forgive him he'll be waiting for me. 

Thanks everyone for the help in getting me through this time 

To all the guys messaging me to say it's my fault and I should be happy he wanted to show me off; I hope your dick gets so dry it falls off

Edit: just to add about the drinking. We had a problem with this before where he'd get drunk and act very angry/ rude towards me. Going as far as insulting me. We talked about it and he no longer drinks regularly. We just drink with friends now so I definitely think that is a big part of it. This was a couple years ago. It also showed me that he is willing to change for the better to keep us going. But this is also a lot worse than just being a drunk butthead

I also saw the conversation and made sure it was between him and her so I know he was honest about what happened with the wife.

I [F25] received a letter from my mother [F49] yesterday in the mail. I've never cried harder.,"So around a week ago I posted on Reddit that I was having issues with my mother. My husband and I took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. We are now working on adopting them. She has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. So I decided to take a step back from her.

I've been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. It broke my heart and I broke down in tears. Probably the most I've cried in so long.

It was such a heartbreaking letter. She said that ""I was a worthless space of a human"" and that ""Those kids would be better off in foster care then with me"". It was a full page of just insults. The one that really got to me was ""You've never accomplished anything and you've never made me proud"". I broke down that line. Throughout my life all I wanted was to make her proud.

I ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. I'm glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. I talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. He truly is my rock.

We both contribute to rent equally, but basically all of the kitchenware is mine. I had it all before she moved in and we agreed before she moved in that we'd share them because she only gets so much money a month and it would be impossible to get her own kitchen stuff. It's no big deal to me, but at the time, her child was exclusively bottle fed.

Now her kid eats rice cereal or oat cereal. I don't know how many people here are parents or whatever but this is the most vile stuff to smell. She mixes this porridge like sludge half and half with formula. It begins to smell immediately and after an hour? I've thrown up before from the smell. But whatever, kids gotta eat.

My problem is my roommate doesn't wash these dishes. She'll make this oatmeal stuff, feed it to her kid, then leave half of it remaining in the bowl in the sink, oftentimes when I'm at work. After 2-3 hours, it turns into cement basically, and our dishwasher won't clean it. I always have to clean it because she's busy with her kid. Try as I might to get her to *just rinse it after use* so it can be put in the dishwasher, it falls on deaf ears. I even asked if she'd get tiny plastic bowls to make it and she said she can't afford it (a 5-pack is only like $5 and are dishwasher safe)...

After about a month of this, I've begun just throwing them out. Instead of cleaning them, I throw my dishes away. We have no bowls now, she can't prepare this stuff in a plate. She's started using my cups to make it and I'll be throwing those away, too. It is nothing to me to replace these things and when I do, I'll be keeping them hidden.

Roommate flushed an expensive family heirloom down the toilet.,"So I'm a Sophomore in college and have been living with a randomly paired roommate who I believe has some form of special needs. If the room is messy he gets into some serious anger fits where he will scream and yell at me about not cleaning up and then proceed to throw all of my stuff around the room. This lasts around 20 minutes and he always apologises profusely and cleans everything up and says it won't happen again. 

Just yesterday he had another crazy anger fit and took my watch off my desk and flushed it down the toilet and proceeded to scream hysterically. The watch was quite an expensive Rolex passed down from my father from his father so it has a lot of significance within the family. I've tried calling the school and sewage system but I've had no luck yet in retrieving it. 

I have moved rooms and spoken to the RA but they have not really offered any significant advice. I have not spoken to my roommate yet as I am both too angry and scared to approach him. I have not spoken to my father yet as I know it will complete devastate him. 

I honestly have no idea how to approach this and any help would be appreciate it. What's the best course of action here?

Edit: thanks for all the support and advice here! I really appreciate everyone who's commented and liked this to help me get the best advice possible. A report has been filed with the police and I've been moved to a different room. Still waiting for a response from my roommate. Watch has not been found yet, but maintenance said its tough to do this on a Sunday (for some reason). 

Edit 2: Thank you for all the kind responses and all the advice, was not expecting this to blow up like this! By some miracle emergency maintenance found it earlier today in the trap along with some other items of mine that he must have thrown down there which they said clogged the toilet. Unfortunately the watch doesn't seem to be working but it should be an easy repair. That being said, I had another altercation with my roommate where he tried breaking into my room. Called the college police and it looks like they may have detained him or taken him away somewhere. It's been a hectic day but it looks like the situation is being handled. Thank you to everyone ‚ù§Ô∏è

TIFU by dating my cousin for 5 months,"You hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing 

I was talking to this guy on Hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, I thought he was the one. After exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. We dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...

Since we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn't had time to meet each other's parents. Instead of doing the traditional, I'll bring you over to meet my parents, and I'll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. You can pretty much tell where this story goes now. 

Long story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend's mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(Uncle's daughter). It took her a second to realize as well. Since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn't seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and I moved to the same city. We could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. Even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn't right to do. That was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. I told my friends that it didn't work out and silently removed everything from social media..

TLDR; dated a boy from hinge for about 5 months, and discovered he was my cousin after our parents informed us while out to dinner

She text me different, usually with less funny pictures and more meaningful statements. Here's the kicker though. He calls her cutie. He's told me in person that he's interested in her. He calls her cutie over text. Now, obviously I can't just outright tell her anything, Because then she'll know I caught a glance. She said I love you to him in person, while we were holding hands, so I guess it's normal. I'm just trying to get some other opinions.

Edit One: Wow, thanks everyone, seriously. I talked to her just before we left school, we ride separate buses. She was very quiet, and spoke very softly, which usually means she's distressed. I told her how it would feel if it was a girl best friend calling me cutie. She agreed with me, I think. I told her how uncomfortable it makes me, that he is very clearly into her and the whole ""I love you"" thing. She has some extracurriculars, so I won't hear from her until around 4:45. Thanks everyone, so much. I'll let you all know what went down.

Edit Two: Nothing yet from her, but I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, because her phone battery is straight booty. If I don't hear from her this evening, assume all has gone wrong.

Edit Three: So, being 17, I have a momma to talk to. So, that's exactly what I did. I went driving with her, I've got to get those permit hours in somehow, and she and I both agreed to just let it ride for a day, see what she does, don't pressure her. However, come Monday, I will confront the guy who is the troublemaker. Obviously, I won't fight him, but he needs to explain himself and his actions. Thank you all for the continual support, I love you all.

Edit Four: Alright guys, here's the stunning conclusion to this saga. He called me, and apologized. He didn't know it was an issue, because apparently flirting with someone in a relationship isn't an obvious problem. He said ""It may have been bad"", but it most certainly was, he didn't get away with that. The girl is feeling much better now, so all things considered, we have come out of this stronger than we were going into it. Thank you all, even the ""You're 17 shut up fag"" comments.

TIFU by cumming into a coconut,"EDIT: I got an AMA thread now. Help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


This TIFU didn't happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

Anyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


Anyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can't fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


I end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

For the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It's heaven. Now before I continue I'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


About a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I'll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.


**Worst mistake I have ever made.**


You see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


I screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. 


**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**


TL;DR Don't fuck coconuts.



EDIT: Jesus this exploded. I'm glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.

EDIT 2: RIP inbox

EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold. It eases my shame a little. I'm thinking of doing an AMA for you more curious individuals. Maybe if the post hits 10K - it's quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back

"Dog died while under sitter's care - story does not add up (Los Angeles, CA, USA)","My fianc√© and I were out of town for vacation and left our two dogs with a sitter who runs her daycare out of her home (Los Angeles, CA). We dropped the dogs off on Tuesday. The sitter informed us she was going out of town on Wednesday but had an alternate sitter lined up who would be staying in her house to cover things from Wednesday until her return on Saturday. She also tells me about the vet tech who lives in the front of her duplex who she sometimes uses for ""emergencies"". 

Today (Saturday) I get a frantic voicemail from the sitter stating that my dog had a seizure and wasn't going to make it. I call the vet and they confirm that he was brought in this morning experiencing convulsions, went into cardiac arrest and they could not resuscitate him. He was a perfectly healthy 5/yo dog with no issues whatsoever when I left him. 

I drive home, frantic, and arrive at the vet to say goodbye to my dog, and am told by the vet tech about the ""bite marks"" he was treated for elsewhere and was brought in with - which I immediately explain I know nothing about. They bring out my dog's body, which has a huge bite mark with approximately two dozen stitches on his spine right at the neck/hackles level. I immediately begin calling the original sitter and alternate sitter to find out wtf is going on. 

Original sitter finally caves and explains that he was ""attacked at the dog park"" by a ""pit-type dog"" and she did not get the other dog owners info. Says that she didn't tell me because she ""didn't want to ruin my vacation and it was no big deal"". I ask the alternate sitter if the original sitter told her to lie to me and her answer was a ""No....Yes... Kind of"" and then she proceeds to tell me that original sitter didn't want to ""ruin my trip"" and so asked she and her boyfriend not to tell me, and they felt conflicted but ultimately followed her wishes. 

I wait for original sitter to get back to town. While outside I confront the vet tech who lives in the front of the duplex asking if he knew anything of what happened to my dog, which he denied. While waiting for original sitter to show up fianc√© overhears the vet tech make a phone call saying ""[original sitter] told people we've been working together and I don't normally do this kind of stuff but I could lose my job"" - moments later a woman pulls up to his house, enters, carries out a pink duvet from his home, and puts it in her trunk and drives away. 

Original sitter gets home and when questioned about a vet receipt for the stitches, gives me a photo taken of a printed receipt that shows services were rendered for the 29th - a day after she was already out of town - and that the credit card charge was entered manually. She cannot provide a physical copy of the receipt and the medications she says they provided my dog (I have the bottles) do not match the medications on the photo of the receipt she gave me. 

She tries to say it must have been a ""brain disease"" and that the dog bite had nothing to do with it... But the vet I spoke with who treated my dog for the seizures said that A) a healthy five year old dog should have survived a seizure so likely it was a bacterial infection that caused it, potentially from the bite; B) my dog should have been held for 24 hour observation after the bite/anesthesia/stitches

It seems to my like the original sitter's story is not adding up and I'm wondering if she didn't have her vet tech friend perform some sort of illegal, back yard surgery to stitch up my dog and then have someone forge the receipt. What can I legally do here to get to the bottom of this situation, and what sort of case do I have against her? I don't even care about the money because it won't bring my dog back, but I want to make sure she is never allowed to do this to someone else.",legaladvice
"(update) School wants my son's Facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. WTF? [Florida]","This is an update to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

I went to school and asked what's going on. I did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

First, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. Second, the principal explained the situation to me. It had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. Thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

When I asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. I asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

I told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. I told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat I'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

Up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

I talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. He only knew that she had left the school. He showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

In short: they backed off after I made sure they understood that I won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

Small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. Someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. I will try talking to them to make sure. They deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at. ",legaladvice

Thanks to everyone's terrific advice, I got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to RAINN) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

Within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and I were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

One of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching I am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

Between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting I was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (I'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

The ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward.

AITA for lying to my boyfriend about when an event starts?,"So this didn't happen recently, but it was brought up last night and my boyfriend seemed to get really mad about it, so I figured I would bring it to the group to see if I'm the asshole or not.

My boyfriend has terrible time management skills and is late for everything.  I absolutely hate it because I am the kind of person that believes if you're not 10 minutes early, you're late.

For an example, we were invited to a family lunch a few years ago.  Everyone was meeting at a restaurant at 11:00am.  We live 10 minutes from said restaurant and my boyfriend waited until 10:55 before getting in the shower or attempting getting ready.  We were an hour late meeting the family, who was already well into the meal when we arrived.

A few months went by and another family gathering invite was sent out, with a 'start time' of 1:00pm.  Knowing that he is terrible at getting ready and leaving on time, I told my boyfriend that the event started at Noon, not 1:00.  And just as I figured at just before noon, my boyfriend started to get ready.  We show up at 1:00, him thinking we're now an hour late, only to find out that everyone else is just getting there too.

So last night we got to discussing things and it got brought up how  I had lied about what time the event started.  I know it's a shitty thing to lie and he pointed out, if I can lie about something like that, whose to say what else I'd be lying about.  I told him he was right to feel like that, but reminded him that I don't have locks on my phone and he knows the passwords/pin numbers to all my accounts so he's more than welcome to check and see if I'm 'hiding something'.  I explained that I only did it because he has terrible time management skills and can't seem to be anywhere on time.  In my opinion, being repeatedly late to things is rude and it's a terrible skill to be teaching his children.

He doesn't have any kind of problems with his family, so there is no reason that he would want to limit his time with them and it's not like these gatherings are boring/unfun events (the one I lied about the start time was actually a family paintball game, which we love to play).

I've learned my lesson and don't plan on doing it again in the future, but I just have to know if I'm the asshole for lying to try and get him to be on time for something that is important to me.


Edit:  So I posted this before I left for work when there was only a handful of comments and wasnt able to check it all day.  I certainly didn't expect it to get this much attention, let alone 20,000 upvotes.

Though I haven't yet gotten a chance to read through or reply to any messages or comments yet, I'd like to thank everyone for their judgements.

TIFU by shocking my girlfriend with my dick.,"So this actually happened today.

My girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch, and I had to get up to do something. As I stood up, she turned me around, and went about undoing my pants. I'm thinking to myself 'cool, unexpected sexytime!'

She gets my pants undone, and slides them down. Next, she pulls my undies down too, revealing the villain of our story. As she leans forward to kiss my stomach, my dick touches her upper chest, and, like an asshole, delivers a static shock.

"(UPDATE) My husband's [M32] ""sabbatical"" has become pathetic and I [F30] want it to end right now.","First, thanks to all who responded to my prior post. A lot of good advice that has helped me navigate this situation.



On the day I made my last post, my husband and I had a talk that night when I got home from work. I basically said he needed to make a doctors appointment for his mental health, or cut out the marijuana use, or both. He repeatedly refused and actually got a bit hostile about it, which is not like him at all.



Then I moved onto finances. I asked him how much of his savings he had left, and all he said was ""enough"". I pressed him for a dollar figure and he wouldn't answer. I asked if he had a balance on his credit card and he said no. When I asked to see his bank statement to confirm, he basically told me to fuck off -- again, hostile and out of character for him.



I told him that the current arrangement wasn't working, and that he'd have to start paying 50% of the bills on March 1st. At this point in the conversation, he completely shut down. He wouldn't even look at me, he just sat looking away from me with tears in his eyes as I talked. I doubt he even heard a word I said, but I clearly stated all the other issues I had -- the Instagram stuff, our plans for the future, etc. 



After this conversation, he stopped sleeping in our bed. For almost a week now he's slept in the basement. He basically doesn't leave the basement when I'm home unless it's to get food. Honestly, it's pathetic.



I am going out with some colleagues this weekend for a fun night, and my husband can stay home like a hermit. I also have a coffee date planned for Sunday with my best friend -- I am going to tell her everything and get her opinion. Because honestly, this isn't the life I want to live and trying to correct it only made things worse. I am beginning to think of divorce as a real option, which would have seemed outrageous even 3 weeks ago.

TIFU by being so pregnant I couldn't see what I was wearing before I went on stage,"This just happened a couple of hours ago. I am 8 months pregnant and *huge*. So I am in the choir at my church, and we were singing a special Christmas song, so everyone was supposed to dress festively. I also had to sing a solo before the message, which I was *very* nervous for. 

I picked out a nice red maternity dress with beading on the collar and wore black tights with black velvet kitten heels. I even painted my nails to match. 

The first service went smoothly... but when I got home, I noticed I had prominent underarm sweat showing on my dress. *Great*, that's probably what everyone was staring at during my solo, lol. So I was determined to prevent this from happening in the second service an hour later. I took off the dress, dried it off, and changed into some pajamas to have breakfast. I also put on an undershirt and stuffed a bunch of tissues under my arms so I wouldn't sweat next time.

Before I knew it, I was running a bit behind, so I put my dress and shoes back on and hustled out the door. I got to the church a minute before the service started and rushed out of my car. Someone asked if it was too windy for me. We're in South Florida, so I had no idea what they were talking about and continued rushing for the doors. 

Unfortunately, the service began a moment earlier and the choir was already on stage. I grabbed my songbook and lumbered onto the stage from the middle aisle, to my place front and center with the other sopranos. Everyone smiled at me awkwardly, which I figured was due to my tardiness.

We started with a hymn... That's when I realized I felt too much fabric around my legs for the kind of dress I was wearing. I worried that the tissues from my arms had fallen and people could see them stuck to my tights or something. I could not see past my belly easily, so I leaned over to check, as conspicuous as it was to do so...

The sight and accompanying horror took a moment to register. There they were, my pink and teal flamingo print pajama pants. Still on my legs. And the whole audience sees them. How the freak did I not notice, and how did I get on stage without anyone telling me?!? 

I rushed off the stage mid-song and took the offending pants off in the bathroom, then waddled back up to my spot. I couldn't even run off afterwards and hide, because I had to sing a solo immediately after that! On the bright side, my stage fright for that was gone...

A former Air BnB guest put a hold on my mail for everyone at my address and has been paying to hold the mail for 2 months! (Texas),"Its kind of a genius revenge tactic, but the ones who suffered the most are my new renters.  One guy has a thyroid problem and had to repurchase $500 in meds.  A lot of people missed paychecks or credit cards.  One lady missed the receipt of a Death Certificate.  We thought someone was stealing the mail from the mailbox at first but then we started watching the mailman just skip over the house everyday and some ""test"" mail didn't move.  So I tried calling the USPS and that got me nowhere.  Going down in person was the only way to do this I guess.  Turns out, some lady who we'd kicked out for being nasty, attracting bugs, and breaking furniture was mad or something or maybe using my address like a personal PO Box?  Who knows.  The post office was really nice about it though and gave me back all my mail.  Still, how could this have happened?  Surely this can't be legal.  I got copies of her hold requests too as proof it was her.  She hadn't lived there in 2 weeks when she put in the first one. 

Edit:  Well that was quick~!  The Post Office called me directly before I could even report her and pro-actively already reported this lady to the postal inspector.  They're very certain what she did is illegal.  Thanks /u/BeamDriver for the advice!  Important lesson here kids:  Don't fuck with people's mail, because the USPS apparently is the most effective law enforcement agency there is.

I (m 31) am growing tired of my wife's (f 31) hangups on sex.....,"Ive been with my wife for about 15 years, if you include the time we dated. We have been married for 11 years in August. 

I love my wife, but the sex just fucking sucks. And it has sucked for the last 5 years or so. Every now and then she will get adventurous and try a different position, but its almost always missionary or ""doggy style"". Sometimes she gets on top, but its rare.

I constantly tell her how beautiful she is, I tell her how much she means to me, and I try my best to do whatever I can to lay signals that Im into her. I hug her, I stand close to her in public, I make it well known that Im pretty damn proud to be with her. 

She reciprocates none of it. She never comes on to me unless I straight up ask her to (seriously, Ill ask, ""can you do me tonight?"") she doesn't spontaneously get playful (in an adult way), she does not masturbate....^ever. I work long hours, and Ill come home and playfully ask if she got adventurous with any of the toys that we have (which are literally collecting dust, btw) and she just snips ""no"" in a fashion like it would be disgusting if she did so. She gets upset if I cum anywhere but inside her or out away from her, as its an inconvenience to be cummed on (one time she got pissed because she had just showered and I came on top of her pussy). She keeps the same positions, same setting (always on our bed, on my side), orgasms and goes to sleep. It fucking sucks. The sexiness factor is zero. I love that fucking woman to death but the intimacy isn't there at all and Im not sure I can do it anymore. Its like its a chore for her, and not something she looks forward to. 

Anywho, it came to head tonight. I asked her if we could, ya know, tonight before bed. She said yes. So the time comes, she was on me and I wasn't totally into it, so I started to get soft. I made up a bullshit excuse, and asked her to just stroke me to get me hard again (oral would be totally out, as I had been inside her, and that is an absolute no go zone for her, so I didn't ask). So she climbs off me and proceeds to take my cock in between her index finger and her thumb and stroke me as she didn't want to touch my dick because it had been inside her. I lost it. I said how depressing it was that she didnt even want to *touch* my dick after it had been inside her. This is supposed to be our sexy time and she is out here acting like everything is icky and Im fucking done with it. She has since rolled over and went to bed without saying goodnight.

I cant live like this. There is no adventure, no surprise, and no spontaneity.  Im too fucking young to be having old people sex for the next 20 years. This was probably more of a rant than an advice piece, but damn.

my (21F) bf (20) told me he would break up with me if I got breast augmentation surgery,"so I have, what is known as, ""tuberous breasts"" where during puberty the breast tissue doesn't develop like it should. the breasts develop droopy & the areolas are large & not proportional to the size of my breast. my plastic surgeon has confirmed this is what it is & told me that if I wanted to correct it, surgery is the only option. the surgery would include releasing the constricted tissue & then an implant will be placed above the muscle.

I am extremely insecure of my breasts, always have been. because I know they don't look normal. I just want to be confident with my body & feel sexy when i take my shirt off.

I mentioned this procedure to my boyfriend & he immediately shot it down. he says he doesn't want a girl with ""fake boobs"". he won't even listen to me when I tell him how gross my breasts make me feel.

I 100% plan on going through with the surgery. I told my doctor up front that I did not want large breasts, just full breasts & he told me that was absolutely achievable. boyfriend still does not agree. my appointment is in April, the day before mine & my bf's anniversary & 3 days after my 22nd birthday.

please tell me if i'm doing the right thing. is there any way to explain to him how this makes me feel? any advice is appreciated.

RM= roommate's mom   R=Roommate

I came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and RM and R were in the kitchen making some coffee. She has never been there this early before. 

I decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. I atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (In brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points I listed:

1. I appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but I want to do that on my own. I love to cook and felt that I was never allowed in my own kitchen. I also told her that I want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. I don't want her in my room. I reminded her that I talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why I put the lock on the door.

3. I told her that if she wants to be with R, to let R text me and lmk that RM would be in the apartment. 

They expressed understanding and I hugged it out with RM. 

Before going to class, I put a load of laundry. My friend is having a birthday dinner today, and I decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. I asked RM multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. I told her that I would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when I finish mine later this afternoon if needed (I didn't want her touching my clothes). She was okay with it and said R didn't have laundry today. Cool. I left feeling really relieved, but I still locked my bedroom door. 

I got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and I couldn't find my white dress. As soon as I came home, R looked nervous. My clothes were in the dryer, and I didn't do that for a fact. RM states that I put them in the dryer and just forgot. Ughhh. I locked myself in my room, and I know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

When I was in my room, I heard RM talking to R in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. In India, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" And she went on to tell R that I won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

I honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.¬† is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? I'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

I'm heading over to my parents right now and I'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. I'll keep you posted.

US citizen cousin (16F) is abroad and under heavy pressure to get married by parents. She asked for my help. [Update: We helped her & she's here],"First post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7h34dk/us_citizen_cousin_16f_is_abroad_and_under_heavy/

Thanks for your help and for pointing me in the right direction.

My sister and I contacted the state department, the embassy and the consulate in Karachi. They were able to verify that she exists and she's a US citizen. We told them of what's happening to her and they were quite helpful in telling us what to do and being ready to help her as soon as possible. 

The challenge was getting her into the consulate in Karachi but she actually got herself there (took weeks of planning) where they gave her travel documents to be able to come to the US. We bought tickets for her to go from Karachi to Doha and then to Boston where we picket her up from the airport. 

By the time her parents realized what's what she was on the Doha to Boston flight. Her parents tried to apply for a visa to come to the US but their visa applications were refused. I'm not aware if the people at the embassy who refused it actually knew about my cousin's supituation or not but we're glad they weren't able to come here.

She currently lives with me and my sister and my sister has been granted guardianship over her. Her priority is to learn English. 

Her parents still try to somehow make her return but we've closed down the lines of communication and hopefully her life from now on will be stress-free. ",legaladvice
My [M20] girlfriend [F19] of 7 years died in a car accident in front of me. I am completely broken. I need some support. UPDATE: My brother decided to end his life..,"Hi, I would like the mods of reddit to delete this post after 2 weeks or so. I just feel the need inform all of you since you showed much interest. 

If you don't remember/haven't read the original post, here it is: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9bmn5k/my_m20_girlfriend_f19_of_7_years_died_in_a_car/

As you see from title, my brother decided to end his life two days ago. I am his older brother, I am 23 years old while he was 20. That day, when he posted on reddit, he came to my house (I live in another city), and he decided to stay. We had a long talk, and I was trying to make him feel better, even though that was a hard thing to do. He also showed to me his post on reddit and told me how helpful you guys were, symphathetic and what not.

Unfortunately the loss of his girlfriend completely destroyed him. He lost over 10 kgs in just approximately 1 month, he was simply refusing to eat, only a few meals here and there, and even though after some point he decided to seek for professional help, as you also guys suggested him, that didn't help him at all. I was trying my best. Until the day he decided to do that he was living in my house, he took a huge break from University so he could focus on healing himself. 

Two days ago I was at work, and he was at home, as always. When I came back I saw something that I hope none of you ever experience in your lives.. He hanged himself. It hurts me saying that. It was rather unexpected. Even though lately he was showing some warning signs to me, I never thought he would actually do that. About a week ago he decided to stop going to the psychologist that was taking care of him, and when I asked him for the reason, he said ""it's just not needed anymore"".

Right next to his dead body there was a letter, and he actually said a bunch of things.He thanked my parents, me, and everyone who was supporting him till the last moment. Even you guys. He said he was sorry and his last words were ""tell mum and dad I love them. I can't keep up with this anymore. I am sorry. I love you"".

I tried my best all those weeks to cheer him up, to go out with him and make him feel better, but he would always refuse. I don't blame him. Losing someone you truly love and are in a relationship with for 7 years is not an easy thing. Even more when you see that person getting killed right in front of you. I am in a complete shock, life was unfair to my brother, and he unfortunately couldn't make it. We were always so close to each other, and he was an amazing brother, an amazing person. It really sucks to say the least. I soemtimes feel it's my fault. 

I felt the need to inform all of you since he posted here a couple of weeks ago and got a huge feedback. I want to say a big thanks on behalf of my brother and from me aswell. You guys are amazing.

Thanks once again.

P.S: A few comments here are saying how this is fake, a made up story. If you think that's the case then it's ok. I am not here to argue or try to persuade any of you, but to rather inform you because a couple here showed much interest and genuinely tried to help my bro. Sucks to say but things like this do happen, and experiencing such is awful.

"AITA for Objecting to ""Female Employee Only"" Parking Spaces at My Workplace?","So theres not too much to say, I guess I'm more curious in others opinions on this.  I am an approx 22.5 year old man, I recently snagged a really really good job.  I work as a corporate level administrator in the trucking industry.  It's been a pretty sweet gig so far and have no complaints as of yet (2 months in). I would also like to preface the following with saying that I work with a very diverse staff of coworkers who are all as professional as they can be, rarely is it that someone cant pull their own weight. 

About a week ago I was walking through the parking lot to my car after the end of the day, and I was looking at the sunset through the chain link fence.  As my eyes darted around i happened to notice a pink metal plate bolted onto the fence, I thought to myself ""woah, what's that and how did i not notice it before?"" So i started reading it and I was immediately greeted with slight disappointment.  Basically, it read as follows ""FEMALE EMPLOYEE PARKING SPACE ONLY!"" with a large symbol in the middle of the sign which is also seen on women's public bathrooms.  

Now, let me clarify I am not ""Irate"" or ""fuming"" about it, but I dont really buy into the whole chivalry, white knighting culture that the men of previous generations upheld *fedora intensifies*.  I even asked my fiance when I got home, just to get a female insight on it.  She said she thought it was stupid.  I guess I'm just coming from the territory of you can show that your a diverse company dedicated to equality, without making tedious or unimportant decisions like special parking.

Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job.

I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.

So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married.

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/al02i9/update_my_30m_wife_30f_lied_to_me_about_where_she

I hate that I'm having to write this but here it goes.

My wife of 6 years and partner of 14 has been studying a lot lately for a certification she wants to get related to her job. She mostly studys at home but will often go to a library or Starbucks if she really needs to focus. We aren't the kind of people that are incredibly co-dependent and we each have our own set of friends and time for ourselves that the other understands.

This does require quite a lot of trust as I've found that people that get exceedingly jealous of their partners are usually the ones that are the most dependent/controlling of them. Well yesterday that trust was shaken a bit for me.

My wife told me that after work she was going to study and then head to the gym. She has a scheduled class at her gym and didn't want to run all the way home and all the way back in the snow and ice so she was just going to study at the library and then head over.

It occurred to me after a few hours though that yesterday was MLK day and all the library's were closed. No big deal, I figured she'd just go to a Panera or something and then head to her class. When she gets home, she's in her full gym outfit but she's still in full makeup and runs right upstairs to take a shower. I asked her how her day went and she said ""It was good. The library was good, I got a lot done and the gym was difficult today which I liked."" I didn't say anything to her about the library being closed and thought the whole thing was odd. While she was in the shower I decided to get on Facebook because the gym that she goes to has a page and they put updates with pictures on there for marketing and what not.

There were only 4 people in the class other than the instructor and my wife wasn't in any of them.

I haven't said anything to her about it yet and I can't help but suspect the worst. It is very unlike her to hop in the shower right after getting home like that, she usually eats dinner and then hops in really late at night. Anyway, I don't really know what to do or how to bring it up to her without sounding paranoid.

Edit 1: I called the library and they confirmed they were closed yesterday. The gym is also really a kickboxing fitness thing and it's only one big room with a bunch of heavy bags - the pics were from when my wife said she was there and she's definitely not in any of them.

Edit 2: So I came home for lunch after reading all the messages. Pretty much half of you are saying talk to her and the other half saying ""collect more evidence"". So I'm torn. 

I did, while I'm here at the house, peak into her gym bag and found this http://i.imgur.com/dnQ74Ds.jpg . There are some gym gloves, hand wraps, sunglasses, headphones... And sexy red underwear. I don't know what the logical explanation for it would be other than the obvious... This sucks. 

Morning update: Wow... So thanks to everyone who reached out about this. It was impossible to read all the comments and reply to every message but I really appreciate it.

I decided not to confront my wife about this last night and instead confide in my best friend who I've know practically my whole life. He was on the ""wait it out, collect evidence"" bandwagon. I haven't begun to do that yet but I will in the next few days.

Last night she did tell me that she was going to do the study/gym thing again today and would be back around the same time as Monday. Again, this is somewhat typical for her. I have a second job that I work Tuesday / Thursday and so M/W are usually her gym days. What is a little strange is the studying away from home again. She does is sometimes but it's rare and I can't remember when she left to study back to back away from home. She gets off work around 3:00 each day and the gym class ends around 7:30, so she's got 4.5 hours to do whatever if she wanted. 

Addressing some of the most popular comments from the comment section.

1. ""How do you know that she wasn't just at a boudoir thing"". I guess anything is possible, we don't live in the largest town and there is only one place I could find online that even advertises that they do stuff like that. I doubt they would give out any information but it just doesn't seem realistic that this is the answer. That's a lot of trouble and lying to go through just to take some pictures. The other part is that I am going out of town this weekend, leaving Friday night and returning Sunday and she will be all alone to do whatever she wants. If she was doing a boudoir thing she wouldve waited until my trip that has been planned for a while and not do it on a holiday.

2. The gym photo. I do know the photo is from Monday 100%, there are hashtags and other things on the Facebook post that solidify that. I also checked their Instagram later and there were more pictures from Monday as well. However it could be from a different time of day as you guys have suggested and not when she said she was there.


I will say for some added context that she has seemed different the past few months, especially sexually. I don't want to get too graphic or anything but she's kind of become fixated on doing new things and being more provocative. I honestly feel like an affair is the only answer. That's all for now, I might update in a few weeks if anything changes. Thanks guys. 

Oh and shoutout to u/VH3m for saying she couldn't be cheating because ""she is fat and no one would want to sleep with that hippo."" you sound nice.

TIFU by giving my son permission to beat his bully's ass.,"My son was born with a condition called Pectus Excavatum. In layman's terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

About three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. 

Well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, ""Dad, I'm cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?"" Well, my son isn't really a fighter. He's fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he's always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. 

Now, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he's in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don't get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

The next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. ""Have you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight."" I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. ""I warned him."" I was so proud. 

He had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. 

TL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn't think he would and he did it.

EDIT ONE: The kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. It wasn't malicious. Just two boys clowning around. He was horrified that he had hurt my son. The bully punched my son in the head every day. Once he found out my son couldn't do anything about it, he just kept on. My son wasn't the only one he bullied, either. Also, the bully's brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son COULD fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

EDIT TWO: My son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a LOT of new friends. He used to hate going to school but now he's disappointed that school is out for summer. Crazy!

It's one thing if you get pregnant when you're a teen and you bust your ass to make sure your kid has food on the table, and a loving home, or if you have a child and then lose your job. It's another to already be on food stamps and government assistance and fall pregnant, and keep the child anyway. I don't want to hear people complain that they can't afford anything. I have no sympathy for people who have children they shouldn't be having. This also applies to people who have fatal genetic diseases they know about and keep having kids.",unpopularopinion
The right is just as easily triggered as the left,"I will probably be downvoted for this since this sub is dominated by right wingers venting their opinions, but for the record I am conservative myself.

I constantly hear talk about trigger culture where sjw's and feminist are sensitive to the point where any little thing they disagree with triggers them. It has become an internet meme and something that right wingers seem to throw around quite a lot. Yet these same right wingers go into an absolute trigger meltdown due to a silly Gillette commercial. The backlash to that commercial has pretty much been as big as the backlash to that ""black kid in a monkey sweater"" H&M picture.

I just found found out my husband (32m) cheated on me (27f) at his bachelor party,"Using throwaway account. We are newlyweds been married less than a month. We lived together for 3 years before we got married and we dated for 4 years before he proposed. I've never had trust issues with him before, we even did long distance for a year when he had to travel for work and it worked out great. 

For his bachelor party half of his groomsmen were also engaged so they had a big blowout bachelor party trip in mexico. I was weary of letting him  go because I know his single friends party hard, they travel just to party with hookers and strippers on yachts. I've heard all their wild party stories. But he assured me there's no way anything will happen because there was only 2 single guys on the trip and none of his friends have ever cheated before. I'm not an insecure person because I'm confident young and attractive so i let him go. Even though there would have been a lot of temptation to cheat I trusted him. 

When he came back from his trip I asked him if anything happened, he said no everyone behaved, especially him! I asked his best man if he had anything to tell me before we tied the knot and he said my fianc√©e adores me and would never cheat on me. We got married as planned. Fast forward to today, a month after we got married. He left his phone on the couch where we were sitting, he left the room to take a shower. His phone is lighting up with texts from his best friend. Talking about the bachelor party. They wanted to go back to the same country that the bachelor party was at for his friend's birthday and were talking about a girl. 

I know his phone password so i opened up his phone and read ALL the text messages with his friend. Basically his scumbag best friend was bragging to my fianc√©e that he covered for him so well there's no way I'll ever find out about him cheating before our wedding. My fianc√©e thanked him and said that the bachelors need to go over their stories so that they all match. I found videos of my husbands friends cheating getting oral from hookers on a yacht. I found photos of my husband kissing a girl on his lap in a bikini which i'm guessing is the one of the prostitutes he was using on his trip. Basically every single guy on the trip had sex with prostitutes which means now not only is my marriage affected but I don't know if it's my responsibility to break 3 women's hearts whose husbands or fianc√©es were also on the bachelor trip. The things I found is going to break up the homes of all his closest friends and I don't even know if I should tell them or not. I screenshotted everything and sent it to myself. 

I don't know what to do because I don't want our marriage to end over this. Honestly I was willing to instantly forgive him if he owned up and apologized immediately after he came home. But the fact that he lied upsets me more than the cheating, is that weird? I don't know if he feels any guilt. I am especially seeking advice from people who stayed in a relationship after discovering infidelity. Is it possible to heal something like this or are we doomed for divorce? This is the first time I've ever been cheated on ever and I don't why I feel like I should be angry but i'm not - is there something wrong with me?",relationship_advice

AITA for removing my birth control without consulting my husband first,"Sounds bad, but going to preface this by saying I'm not tryna get pregnant without my husbands consent 


I went to the doctor yesterday because I've been super emotional and my body has been out of whack and my doctor was basically like ""We gotta get this implant out of you"" (I had nexplanon, the implant in your arm) and I decided to give my body a break from hormones and to use condoms/ other methods for the time being because I don't want to conceive.


I call my husband and tell him and he's like ""Oh ok did you get on the pill?"" And I said no, I didn't want to be on hormones anymore and he flipped out and said I need to be on birth control because it's the best way to not get pregnant but like, there are things he can do to not get me pregnant but now his whole family and him are convinced I'm like trying to get pregnant without his consent. Should I have called and discussed this with him since it effects him too (as in he has to wear a condom)

ETA: if I hadn't of taken it out yesterday, I would have to wait a month because that was my gynos my next available appointment. So it wasn't that I didn't want to consult my husband, it was kind of a quick decision.


ETA #2: I have a fucked up cervix so I can't have an IUD, can't use tampons, lots of stuff.


ETA #3: I believe now he is the asshole; it's not normal for a husband to react this way, and he kinda sucks anyway. Thank you for the support and the judgement (even the dude who messages me I was basically just a sex doll)",AmItheAsshole
(Washington) I bought my son's friend a hamburger and some hot dogs and his mom is reporting us to CPS for child endangerment.,"As my kids are about to go back to school, we decided to have a fun weekend. I took both my kids and one friend each to a Mariners game this weekend. While there, we had cokes, hot dogs, garlic fries, peanuts, and burgers before the game. All basic baseball game junk food. I am always shocked at how much it costs but we had fun so I didn't mind. Last night, my son's friend's mom called us and started screaming on the phone that we allowed her son to eat meat. She said her son is a strict vegetarian and that is how they have brought him up and that we had no right to give him food that she doesn't allow. I know the boy pretty well as he's basically got free rein of the house since they've been friends for years. When he spends time with us, there have always been veggie options for him, but for a while now, he has decided to eat meat with the rest of us. He's 15 years old, and I figured he can choose to eat whatever he wants when he's in our home. I don't care. But according to her, I should have refused to let him eat meat at the game and bought him something else. She didn't seem to be aware that he's been eating meat at our house for about a year. She said she's going to file a complaint with CPS for child endangerment and interference with parental rights Monday morning. I always thought her elevator didn't make it quite to the top floor, but this seems completely bonkers to me. Do I have anything to worry about here?",legaladvice
AITA for Introducing my GF as a Model?,"So I have been dating this Girl for awhile now. She's beautiful. She works as a professional model. Not like an Instagram wannabe but a real professional model with professional shoots and an agency and everything.

She also practices martial arts has a few black belts and works as an instructor in her school, gym, dojo whatever its called. She usually tells people shes a martial arts instructor and not a model. For some reason she doesn't like to tell people she's a model even though thats where she makes most of her money. She only makes like 12 dollars an hour and works part time as a martial arts instructor.

So the other day I was introducing her to some people and she told them she was a martial arts instructor when they asked her what she did. I said ""Thats not really how she makes her money though shes a model"" and she shot me this dirty look. Later she said I was an asshole for saying that that she doesn't like to tell people shes just met that shes a model and I had no right to correct her. That what she said is true, she does teach martial arts and she wasn't lying. That her passion is teaching martial arts but it doesn't pay that well so she models to pay the bills but that's not what shes passionate about.

I dont see what the big deal is so AITA here for telling people what she really does for money?

\*\*Edit just to clarify I she didnt tell me she preferred to not say she was a model specifically beforehand. I just noticed she never mentioned it but it was not something we talked about until after I did it. Also I was genuinely proud of her for being a model and when I introduced her to my friends.

\*\*Edit 2 Theres so many comments and I am trying to read them all. I do respect her. I do love her for more then her beauty. Shes a genuinely good and kind person, she loves kids (she teaches kids in her classes) animals, just a very big hearted and sweet woman. She's smart and fun and we share a lot of interests. Honestly I am blown away with how pretty she is and I've never dated a woman who is as pretty as she is. So that part does excite me.

I genuinely thought the modelling was the more prestigious of her accomplishments because while you may think I am the asshole for this I do value how much money a field brings in. When I chose my area in college I did choose between a few specialties because this one paid the most. I am going to talk to her about it and find out more about why she values the martial arts more and I am not going to judge based on how much money it makes. I'm going to respect whatever reasons she has.

I shot an apology text (We're both at workright now) and sent her flowers to her Dojo. She said we can talk after work and I offered to take her to her favorite restaurant.

&#x200B;

\*\*Final Edit

At this point I imagine no one is reading anymore I asked the mods if I should post this update and they said to edit it into the original post.

I was really bothered by the things people said. Not because I wanted to bury my head and refuse to accept them but because maybe there was some truth to it. I didn't want to be the guy everyone said I was. I really didn't.

&#x200B;

First I want to make it clear that she never told me before not to refer to her as a model. Yes I knew she usually didn't lead with it but it was never something we had discussed before. We have been dating for around 3-4 months.

&#x200B;

Next I want to say She was meeting some of my good friends. I was not trying to ""show her off"" in that she was a trophy for me. I was trying to point out her accomplishments. I thought it would make her look better for my friends to know she also made good money as a model. I can see where I was wrong. I did place more value on her career as a model because she made more money and I felt it was more glamorous. I am an asshole for that. I did interject that she was a model and undermine the image she wanted to project of herself and I'm also the asshole for that too. I wont deny it. But I DONT just see her as a trophy. I do see her as a complete and wonderful person and theres more on that later because I learned something really really important.

&#x200B;

After this thread blew up like it did and I had hundreds and later thousands of responses saying what a dick I was I knew I was dead wrong and had fucked up. I texted her with an apology and she said she was used to that bullshit. I asked her if we could talk about it and I could try and make it up to her. She agreed. I told her I wanted to learn more about what she did as a martial arts teacher and asked her if I could sit in on some of her classes. She said she would like that. I made it top priority. I left the office early to go and sit in and see what this was about.

&#x200B;

What I saw really opened my eyes to be honest. I watched two classes and took part in the second one. The first one was her with a kids after school class. She was kind, patient, and just really great with the kids. Someone said something  to the effect that she couldn't be that successful if she only taught kids. Thats dead wrong. It must be much harder to teach kids and I think it makes her a much better teacher that shes able to reach and teach these kids. I saw how she will be a great mother (and before you rip me a new one she DOES want to be a mom one day).

&#x200B;

The second class was a womens self defense class. I took part in this one as ""the bad guy"" and I was a practice dummy for her lessons on how to fend off assaults. I got manhandled by about 15 women. We had a a few short sparring sessions in between her classes and she worked me. For those of you who wanted her to beat me up she got the chance to (although she didn't hurt me she could have if she wanted to)

&#x200B;

I definitely saw the value beyond money in what she does. She taught 30 kids about discipline, confidence, courage, standing up to bullies, she taught 14 women how to defend themselves from an assault. Most importantly I saw the qualities beyond her appearance that I love most about her really shine. I realized the things I love most about her; Her courage, her compassion, her strength, her assertiveness, her kindness, and patience, her wisdom, her discipline this is where it comes from. This is really the part of her I love. It doesn't come from the modeling it comes from this. I also saw how much she loved what she was doing. I saw in her a light that shone in a way that never does when she talks about modeling. I'm honestly a little emotional about how wrong I was.

&#x200B;

I told her this when I went out to dinner and we talked about what it means to her and why its important. She also filled me on the modeling thing. She doesn't like to lead with it for a number of reasons that most of you pointed out

&#x200B;

First off its not as glamours as I thought it was

&#x200B;

She said many times she has to deal with negative stigmas as the result of saying shes a model

&#x200B;

She works as a model because of a few accidents. She was born pretty and she ran into an agent as a teenager. Thats all it took for her to be a model. It took her years of work and dedication to be where she is with martial arts. She started as a little girl and pushed through it all throughout both her childhood and her teenage years which is pretty impressive when you consider how transient interests usually are for kids and teens. She feels a greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment doing this then having her pictures taken. She said being called a ""Model"" defines her by her appearance defines her by WHAT she is and not WHO she is. She doesn't want to be defined by the way she looks she wants to be defined by what she does. She doesn't feel that being a ""model"" is who she is its just something she does to make money but its not a core part of her identity.

&#x200B;

She doesn't feel the modeling industry encourages a healthy body image for other women and feels guilty that she is the image that many other women look to and are expected to look like. That she often has to deal with jealousy from other women or that she can make other women feel insecure about themselves and she doesn't like that. She doesn't want other women to feel bad about themselves because of her. She feels while its hypocritical of her to profit off of it she feels like it would be stupid to turn down the chance to make good money while she can. She wants to use this opportunity while she is still young enough to earn up the money to open her dojo or buy the ones she works at now and do that full time when she ages out of modelling.

&#x200B;

This is where I lit up and felt I had something to really offer her. I work in finance. Go ahead hate me but I DO like money. I like to have it, I like to make it, I like the freedom it affords and I like to watch it flow and grow. So I offered to help her come up with a financial plan to reach her goal of opening up her own dojo. I thought it was a great opportunity for me to use what I know and love to help her do what she knows and loves. We both win. She agreed and next week we are going to meet to go through her finances and I will put together a plan to help her hit her goal.

&#x200B;

Finally I asked her if it was ok to sign up for one of her classes and she lit up and said she would love that.

&#x200B;

I know a lot of you are probably going to be disappointed she didn't dump me on the spot. I learned a lot today, a lot about her, a lot about myself. In the end this turned out to be something that helped me learn a lot more about who she is and why I love her. So honestly thank you AITA yea you were mean, yea you were vitriolic, yea it hurt, but I needed it to show me how far up my own ass my head was. Is she the better person? Yes she is. Do I deserve her. No I dont, But I am going to do better. I really do love this woman, I wont ever do this again.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by stuffing my face with edibles before dinner with my wife's parents.,"Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife's parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?

So the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""Yes, yes and yes!""  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro's Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

And it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

When we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""Dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

And then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

About 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that's when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""Diarrhea?""  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""You didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""Of course not."" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

A few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don't remember how I made it to my seat, and I don't remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if I was doing alright.

""Keep it together, man,""  I say to myself.  But my wife's sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.

The waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

The moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  

""You are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

At this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""Are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""Yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

My wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""Bathroom. Now."" she hisses. ""Get it together.""  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  

Now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

But deep down I know that is absurd:  I've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

But the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

After finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

Next, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife's horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

Smart man. 

However, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" I suggest helpfully to my wife.

""What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

And at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!"" she demands.

""Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,"" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don't want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.""

""REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.""

I look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

TL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


EDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.

As for Part II of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""Please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",tifu
Tangled was a better movie than Frozen," Tangled had a better storyline than frozen. Tangled was about escaping a toxic environment and finding one's self. For all rapunzel's life, she was stuck in a tower having one view of life. Her mother told her that the world was cruel and unforgiving. While her mother was partially right about the world, (the Stabbington brothers were kind of evil) they also were good people. While on her adventure, she learned not to judge based on appearance. She even had a musical number with people that were considered thugs. Rapunzel was also an Icon. She didn't need Eugene but knew when to accept help. She saved Eugene and herself many times during the movie with a frying pan. Even the song ""I see the light"" was better than let it go.

LPT: If you're ever called by your bank's fraud department hang up and call them back.,"I got a call from someone claiming to be from fraud department of my bank over the weekend. The call showed up on my caller ID as US Bank which is how I have it saved in my contacts. He said there was a fraudulent charge from American Airlines and I was on that their website booking a flight about an hour prior to the call. 
For a moment I thought it was legit but then he asked for a pin #.

"[Update] I allowed my sister to move in with me, dad tried to say I kidnapped her to avoid child support (CT to NY)","Update of my previous post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i\_allowed\_my\_17\_year\_old\_sister\_to\_move\_in\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/91hftj/i_allowed_my_17_year_old_sister_to_move_in_with/)

&#x200B;

TLDR: I didn't get in trouble for taking in my little sister and a court order for child support was issued.

&#x200B;

So, I had my day in court today for the child support hearing. Dad actually showed up for court instead of using the option of conference call like my mother did. My sister (let's call her Valerie) wanted to sit in the courtroom in case the judge had any questions for her in particular (he didn't, but I'm proud of how brave my sister is for going to court when she didn't have to) because I could feel my heart beating in my throat the entire time. 

The judge started out by saying he was unsure if a support order could be issued today given that Valerie is now 18 and in CT would be ineligible but in NY would be eligible until 21 but then began asking some some questions.

Dad did a lot of talking at first, mostly saying how he had a court order that gave him full custody of Valerie and that Mom was supposed to be paying him child support.  Then he said how Valerie dropped out of high school and left the state to live with me without telling him or getting his permission and how he didn't know for a month after the fact. he complained that Mom never speaks to him about anything, that I make no effort to have a relationship with him and that Valerie doesn't either. Boo-hoo, we're all ganging up on him and he doesn't know what he did to deserve it, etc.  Sure enough, as a few of you kind folks mentioned, the judge asked him ""Why didn't you know where she was for a month if she was supposed to be in your custody?"" 

He then says that she was staying with her mother at the time but that she would've had a place with him and still does have a place with him if she had asked. At that point, sick of hearing him play the victim, I piped up and asked as calmly as I could manage ""Why didn't she have a place with you 9 years ago when you dropped her off at Mom's house, didn't tell her you weren't coming back for her and then got rid of all her belongings?"" 

My mother on the phone confirmed what happened and said that she asked me if I could take in my sister because of my brother's violent behavior early in 2017. Valerie was 17 at the time she moved to NYS and is still attending high school to earn her diploma (better late than never) and I've been her sole source of support ever since. 

The judge then reviewed the guidelines for monetary support. My mother, being disabled and on social security, was to pay no more than $50 per month for support. Dad was to pay no more than 17% of his income, which translated to to roughly $800 per month. The judge asked me what amount I was looking for. My answer was that I just wanted some help with the groceries and her medical bills so I asked for a total of $250 from Dad and the max $50 from Mom. Dad tried to haggle me down to $200 per month because he just bought a house last year (you should've seen the look on the judge's face). The judge reminded him that the guidelines recommended $800 a month and I held firm on $250. Dad sighed and said he'll have to give up smoking to afford it (this is supposed to make me feel bad?). 

The judge made the order for support, effective until age 21 AND I never did get in trouble for allegedly ""kidnapping"" my little sister.

Thank you to everyone here that gave me encouragement to see this through and not fall for Dad's intimidation tactics.

Cold weather is much better than warm weather,"I know most people do not agree with this, which is why I think it's a fitting post for this page.  Not only is the weather more comfortable, but the cold time of the year is simply better all around.  

I believe people strengthen their relationships in cold weather.  You're more likely to sit together on the couch with your spouse or children to watch a good movie under a blanket.  I believe winter vacations are amazing.  Going skiing/snowboarding in beautiful locations in so much fun.  The holidays are during this part of the year which brings you together with your family more often and reminds you about the important things in life.

My best friend (F24) became a widow three months ago and is acting like she's never been married,"My best friend, let's call her Elisa, is a 24 years-old engineer who got married two years ago to her first and only boyfriend, both were high school sweethearts. He died in a car crash three months ago and ever since, Elisa's been acting weird.

She never calls herself a widow, she only says she's not with her ex-boyfriend anymore. When referring to her late husband, she calls him her ""ex"". Last week, a guy flirted with her during one of her classes (she's doing her masters degree) and, even though she said she's not interested, she said she would love to get married someday. She was deeply in love with her late husband and I'm not sure if she's dealing with her grief in a healthy way.

AITA for being mad at my wife for dumpster diving?,"Hi everyone, I'd like some input. 

My wife and I struggle to make ends meet. We strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. This includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

Recently our DD dropped the milk and spilled it. It was 5 days to payday and we'd already done our grocery shopping. My wife said she'd figure it out. I know she has a little money stashed for herself that she's gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, I figured she must have decided to dip into that. Boy was I wrong. 

The next week I noticed our food was a little...higher quality. A couple of brand name things, even a roast on Sunday with asparagus. I figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when I asked she said ""oh no, I found a bunch of money off coupons."" Then she showed a few to me. 

They were those ""Earn 0.07$ a gallon"" receipts you get at the gas station. She had gone there and dug through the garbage! She said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

I was speechless. I asked her how she could lower herself like that. She replied that she did it for our kids. When I asked why she didn't use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

I'm so disgusted guys. I can't believe she did this. I don't even want to look at her. She on the other hand is mad at me, and says I'm an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. AITA for expecting my wife NOT to dumpster dive?

Edit: OK! I am definitely the asshole. After reading all of your comments, I really thought about it. I talked to my wife, and told her I was sorry for the way I acted. She is annoyed but willing to forgive me. I was actually mad at myself. The reason we are struggling is because I was in an accident a few months ago. I slid through a stop light on an icy road. It has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade I've worked in for 15 years. I'm on disability through my employer but it isn't even half of what I used to make. We are getting by, but it is tight. And I don't know what we are going to do when it runs out. My wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). I guess I was just mad at myself because I can't take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. I'm going to give her a foot rub tonight. Thanks for the honesty guys. ",AmItheAsshole
"Cousin needs a life-saving hysterectomy but insurance doctor won't approve because ""She's not done having babies.""","My cousin has been getting these terrible infections after having her first child.

"[FINAL UPDATE] My [29M] fiancee [28F] of 4 years randomly claimed I abused her, and called the police. This came completely out of the blue.","Original post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)  
Update post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

So firstly thanks for all of your input. I read and considered every single reply. First I'll update you, then I'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. I want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, I'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and I feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

Update: 

I spoke to her in person after I posted my update. From her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. Her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. She was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""I don't know, I'll probably tell him that I feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. Then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

I said great, all that is understandable. Just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

She said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

I thanked her for telling me, and then I called off the wedding entirely. 

She cried, I cried, it was a goddamn mess. She asked where we go from here. I told her I don't know. I don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but I know that the engagement is over, and that **if** I decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. And now I have to decide if **I** want that. Do I went to spend another 4 years being undecided? If I'm being honest with myself, I imagine it taking another couple of years before I can trust her again. Do I want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? Close to 40? 

I told her that I have a lot to think about. 

I spoke to her dad last night. We shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. My ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. She's been crying a lot. I do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

Her dad caught wind of the situation on Facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. He'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. She told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. He told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. He said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

So that's it. I still have a lot to think about. I know a lot of you guys are telling me that I have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that I still love her and have loved her for a few years now. Right now, I'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

As for my reputation, nobody thinks I'm an abuser. It's firmly out there now. Her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. I haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. There's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

My family agrees with a lot of you. They're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. Just give me some time. I'm not going to make another update post, because I've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe I'll just update this post in a few days after I've decided what to do.",relationship_advice

My (26F) husband (31M) cheated at his bachelor party,"I don't know what to do. We got married in December and things were perfect. We've been together since I was 23. 

His friend is getting married and I noticed one of his other friends give my husband a funny look when talking about the new bachelor party. Like raising his eyebrows and laughing. My husband did not react and ignored him but I knew something was up. 

We allow each other on our phones so he was sleeping one night, I was awake, I saw it and got tempted. Went through messages and pictures. I saw a few things in his photos in the ""hidden"" album, he didn't really hide it too well but we don't go on each other's phones so he probably thought he was fine. I saw a video and a couple of pictures of a girl blowing my husband. It was fucking disgusting. He actually bought me a necklace when he came back, just realized he probably felt guilty or something. 

I read through his messages and saw his friends mentioning the party while planning the new one. He apparently snorted coke off some girls boobs too. My husband was telling them to forget about it and it was a long time ago and he was just having fun for one night and it would never happen again and he's committed to our marriage.

AITA for leaving an 18 cent tip and getting the waitress fired?,"I was dining at an upscale restaurant and the bill came out to $49.82. I pulled out a $50 to pay, and told the waitress I didn't need change. Goes without saying, but I was planning on leaving the rest of her tip on the table. I used to work as a server. I always tip generously. 

The waitress misunderstood my intentions and said ""Really?"" loud enough for all the other diners to hear. Before I could say anything, she said something like ""Woooow- thanks for the generous tip"", snatched the payment from the table, and walked away in a huff. All the diners around me were staring daggers at me. It was humiliating. 

I flagged down the manager and let him know what happened. He knows me and knows I'd never stiff servers. 

He offered to comp the meal, but I said it wasn't necessary. I just wanted to let him know what happened and would be on my way. The manager insisted that I was owed an apology. Made sense to me at the time. She apologizes, gets her tip, I leave, everyone is happy. 

When the manager called the waitress over, both of us saw her roll her eyes as she was walking here. As soon as the manager saw this, he put on his ""you're about to get fired"" face. All the tears and pleading made no difference. It was ugly. People were filming with their cell phones. 

As she was being escorted to the back by some kitchen workers (who probably think I'm the second coming of Satan). The manager insisted on comping our meal and we went on our way. 

When we got home, the wife claimed I was an asshole for making a huge scene out of nothing, and getting that poor girl fired over a simple misunderstanding. I feel like all I did was share a legitimate complaint to the manager. She is the one who escalated it by rolling her eyes at us. Am I being unreasonable? What would you have done in this situation?

I believe my HIPPA rights were violated when my surgeon's scheduler told my parents I was pregnant,"I never thought about the situation like this but I had people point out that my rights may have been violated and I'm not sure what steps to take next and I'll try to explain the situation the best I can.

I am 24 and live in the USA and I'm on birth control but it failed. I didn't realize I was pregnant until I went into the hospital for something unrelated and found out I needed surgery for something and that I was pregnant on the same day. I quickly looked into abortion options but haven't been able to go through with it because I haven't had the funding but I'm trying to figure that out now so I can get the surgery and be healthy again. 

I went for my surgical consultation and the doctor said he would feel much safer waiting for me to terminate before performing the surgery but I would have to schedule the surgery through his assistant A. A called me shortly after the surgical consultation and pressured me the entire phone call to keep the baby but when I told her I was planning on going through with the termination wouldn't schedule my appointment until I had gone through with it. So I've had to put the appointment off and wait until then, which is fine, but my parents are in on why I need the surgery and I've had to come up with excuses as to why I can't schedule it yet because I don't want them to try to pressure me to not terminate. 

Fast forward to last tuesday and I get a text from my dad that says something to the effect of 'we know why you haven't scheduled the appointment and we're very disappointed in you.' It turns out that they called the office and the assistant disclosed my pregnancy to my parents and it's causing me a great deal of emotional turmoil because my parents have been acting super weird around me and now I'm doubly stressed about the situation. I never gave her or anyone else to disclose my medical status to anyone and I feel like my rights as a patient have been violated.
 
I guess my questions would be: Do I have grounds for legal recourse, what would my next steps be and what should I do from here.

I went searching for other video clips and information about the incident where they said that these kids approached the elder, interrupted a ceremony, got in his face and started chanting things like ""build the wall."" I did not find evidence of that, but I did find a whole bunch of other footage and tried to piece everything together. 


I found a statement from one of the kids that a local reporter [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/AClementsWKRC/status/1086822521012473858) w/ a bunch of video clips he mentions in the statement.

- From a [full video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3EC1_gcr34) that was originally posted by a religious(?) group that was there called the Black Hebrew Israelites (BHI), it shows them street preaching to the NA group, telling them that they're worshipping the wrong god, etc. Some NA people walked up to them offended and they got into a vocal spat at the beginning of the video. The group of kids aren't seen until [46:41](https://youtu.be/t3EC1_gcr34?t=2802), where one of the street preachers calls the kids fagg***, crackers, school shooters, etc) and they walk away ~5' later while they're being called animals. 





- The group of kids congregate off to the side seen on [1:05:00](https://youtu.be/t3EC1_gcr34?t=3927), waiting I assume for a bus to pick them up. BHI turns around and starts calling them names again and then the kids start what sounds like school chants and a mini haka at 1:09:00. I do not hear 'build a wall' in any of the videos. More kids meet up with the group; I guess that's the meeting place they were told to go to and they start doing another chant. One street preacher provides commentary on their chants. Kids take a knee at 1:12:00 and BHI jokes(?) that they're kneeling to Israel (them) and then the kids start another chant while the NA group appears around 1:12:20 heading into the group of kids. Some people in the NA group were dancing as they meet the kids who were finishing up their chant. The kids turn around and start jumping up and down to the beat of the drums. No one tells the kids what they're doing; they're just beating drums at them and doing their own chanting. And while I might consider it disrespectful, it doesn't look malicious when the kids joined in the NA chants (this is where all the shocking viral clips came from). These kids did not approach the NA group, interrupting their ceremony. The rest of the video is BHI talking to some of the kids and trying to antagonize them.





- Close up of when the NA group approached the student group as they were doing another chant: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnLJLjuiRg8






- Another [video is one where the doxxed kid is standing in front of the elder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npX801xLSFY) The small group of kids confronting BHI starts chanting again and the rest of the group does as well. Several kids in the back are dancing and look like they're enjoying listening to the drums and chanting from the NA group. A couple of kids ask what is going on and wondering what the NA group is doing at [1'06""](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=66) and [1'20""](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=82). People on social media were angry at pictures that looked like the doxxed kid was smirking at the elder, thinking that he was making fun of him or intimidating him. But it honestly looks like an awkward situation where someone approached right to him, looking at him and performing something. Like, I myself would just stare and wait, listening until the elder was done like the kid was doing. 






- Off to the side, a man from the NA group is heard talking to another kid at [1:35](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=95), saying ""white people, go back to Europe where you came from...this is not your land..."" Things get heated, and the doxxed kid who's facing the NA elder turns to the other kid at [2:09](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=129) and motions to him to just let it go and stop arguing while the elder is finishing his chant. That, to me, doesn't seem like a kid who is acting maliciously. Things get even more heated from that one guy and it looks like some of the kids realize that these people don't like them and they walk away. The rest of the video is a kid again wondering what just happened, the NA group finishes their performance and cheers w/ that one guy still being worked up, and more BHI preaching stuff where they call [""trump a homosexual""/rants about gays/etc](https://youtu.be/npX801xLSFY?t=437) and the kids are wondering where the buses are to leave and they get excited and chant again when the buses arrive.







- After looking at what I think is everything, it's clear the social media mob is going after them for no reason.  The viral clips look downright malicious and horrible out of context, especially when people who look at it automatically think these kids are evil just based on the hats they're wearing. It's clear they were not being malicious and it also looks like the viral clips were exploited for political propaganda. It's disgusting that adults would use kids this way for their own gain, and I'm sickened that people are still harassing and doxxing these kids. Yesterday and even this morning there are people on social media who are asking their followers to literally assault these kids and ruin their lives for no reason except what they imagine. So far, 0 media organizations that wrote about the viral clips have not looked to see what actually happened. It's really disconcerting that we have reached the point at what I thought was still a civil society where hatred of someone is re-directed at kids.

AITA for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?,"For the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. I'll call her Princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. She is a medical researcher (Studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. I was apprehensive because I know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

We have a 4 bedroom house. Me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler Freddie. I told sister that Princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed OK with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. Princess even said it would be OK to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. It's getting a lot colder now and I'd never let Freddie sleep outside. 

I told Princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

In all honesty I was right in thinking having Princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. She goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. Since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

She's also rude to my kids. My daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but Princess was lovely enough to say that if her BF had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. Daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and I had a word with Princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

Had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. I made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. I also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that I wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. Sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. Sorry but how can I be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

EDIT: A lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. I won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. Firstly to the people who have claimed I was acting snobby about Princess's job. That wasn't the case. I wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that I could say she's ''only a researcher''. On the contrary, I specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. She earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. She just wanted more money to herself. 

Also, the people who claim that I was being nasty to her because I didn't like her and things like that. I don't dislike her at all. I was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, I've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. I was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. She has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because Princess constantly bullied her. 

Regarding the dog's room. There isn't any furniture in Freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

And for those who think I was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. We tried our best to make her feel welcome. Gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. We gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, I went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. Within her first week here, Princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that Freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

Regarding the weed and clubbing thing: I've nothing against weed use. I smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and I'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. If she was doing it away from the house I would not care at all. I wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. I'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. However, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

Last but not least, I didn't call her ''Princess'' on here offensively. I wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her Princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",AmItheAsshole

Recently my son talked to me and said that he wanted to propose to him. I was happy for him of course. I congratulated him. Then we started talking about some stuff. He asked me opinion about him.

TIFU by letting this subreddit devolve into a collection of creative erotica writing assignments [META],"I don't know if Meta threads are allowed, but I think this needs to be said. I believe the removal of the ""NSFW only on weekends"" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. The majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting TIFUs that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. Nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, TIFUs that are actually not TIFUs at all and serve only as humble brags - TIFU by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool I am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. Sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.

When you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling OP out for the story obviously being fake/barely a TIFU (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so I really doubt I am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.

TL;DR: Personally I think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the NSFW weekend rule. These post clearly have their audience so I have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. However I don't think it's fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day.",tifu
My Roommate's(21F) Parents keep letting themselves into my (21 F) apartment with the spare key my roommate gave them.,"TLDR: MY roommate's mom keeps coming into my apartment 

Backround: my parent's are family friends with my roommate's parents. I was never really friends with my roommate in high school, but got to know her from living with her in a dorm. Recently, MY PARENTS got ME an apartment and pay¬† RENT every month. So pretty much, roommate's parent's don't pay 

Over the past few months when we come home from class,¬† we have walked in on
1. Her mom doing our laundry almost every week. 
2. Her mom cooking food and cleaning for us 
3. HER MOM CLEANING MY FUCKING CLOSET and calling me a slut for having tube tops and mini skirts, etc
5. Her Mom and dad chillin at the apartment Friday nights to make sure we don't party. 

I just can't deal anymore. I told my roommate to tell them to stop, but she said I'm overreacting. Am I overreacting? Should I tell my parents?

I have lost my mind. Literally. Udhdudbdu helpppp.

Edit 2: Imma tell my parents about it. I just didn't want to ruin their friendship as they were close friends for a lonnggggg time.

Mini update: I took out edit 1 to shorten the post. I told my older brother about what happened, emailed my building manager, and was able to get a response from him saying I can put a lock on my bedroom door. Me and my brother went to home depot and got a basic lock. Her mom is currently cooking in the kitchen and watching my brother fix the lock. She doesn't look too happy. I'll update you all again when I tell my parents.

Edit: sorry for all the edits but I think I need to clarify something. The reason my roommate isn't paying rent is cause her parents hit a tough spot financially last winter, and my dad wanted to ease the burden on them a little. He said he would help out by giving my roommate a place to stay so her parents could just worry about her tuition and not room/board.

TIFU by putting my dick in a year old fleshlight,"I bought a fleshlight back in February of 2018, using it on and off again for about 3 months until I decided to box it up for good. I had had enough of the joy the toy brought me, and had just started a relationship with my now lovely girlfriend.

Flash forward to yesterday, when I was looking through my old junk. I was bored and decided to do some (late) spring cleaning, when I came upon the box. I smirked and opened up the box to see my prized possession, the fleshlight. I put it aside for today, when I decided to use it. Out of lube, I went it dry, fuck up #1. Once I reached as far in as my lil member would let me in it, I felt a tickling sensation. Uneased I pulled out fast, giving my dick a rug burn type sensation. To my surprise, and disgust, I was met with a spider on the tip of my dick. Without thinking, I instantly flicked it off with my long ass fingernails, scraping the tip of my dick. In pain, I freaked out and let the spider get away.

My dick now hurts, and a spider is now loose in my house.

tl;dr - stuck my dick in a unused fleshlight just to find a spider on my tip, hurting myself in the process of getting it off


Edit: threw out the toy, couldn't get the image out of my head...

AITA for telling my grandma she looks like Ronald McDonald because she wouldn't stop telling me I look like a bull with my nose ring in?,"Edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought I'd make an edit. My piercing is NOT a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. Septum piercings are usually tagged as ""looking like a bull"" (I don't agree with that) but I have my hoop in my nostril.

Here's how it happened. Every time I see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of ""take that thing out of your nose, you're ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull."" The last time she said it to me I politely asked her to leave it alone or next time I wouldn't be so polite. To be fair this is the first time I spoke up because I'm not confrontational but the older I get the more I stand up for myself. And for that matter, I shouldn't even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

Fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. I immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like Ronald McDonald. A lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but A) I warned her and asked her to stop and B) she's insulting my appearance so why is what I said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? I'm usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn't even make sense) does not ""ruin"" my face and even if it does it's really not her place. I'm a grown ass woman and I refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman.

Schools should not punish bullied kids for fighting back.,"If a kid gets physically hurt by a bully, I believe defending oneself should be allowed, since a slap on the wrist/detention will do almost nothing to make the bully ""see the light"" in his wrongdoings.

To my knowledge, he is still a virgin. He does know the basics about sexual health, pregnancy, prevention, and STD prevention. Another thing my mother and I butt heads about but she gave in on that one.

My mother refused to talk to him about the fact that if they were to engage in a sexual relationship, it would be illegal in my home state. She said he is innocent and he's not sexually active. It wasn't necessary. I implored her to change her mind because things can progress very quickly and he needed to know.

Last night I called my brother and discussed it with him myself. I didnt try to scare him, just gave him facts. He also told me they haven't done anything yet. I told him that if sex was something they are considering, they should wait until after her birthday in 3 months. I told him that sex can happen at their own pace when they are ready.  I also mentioned was not for or against him having sex, only that I wanted him to wait until he wouldn't get in trouble.

I tried really hard to give a respectful but informative talk. My mother is pissed that I talked to him about it when she told me no.

"Girlfriend won't go to sleep until she is satisfied with our ""cuddle time""","So before your read, I need to say I have nothing against cuddling to sleep. I actually love it.

The problem I have here is that my girlfriend won't go to sleep, or will cry, unless we have a ""cuddle time"" before turning off the light.

And honestly I wouldn't even mind if it lasted like 5min, and that we would just drift to sleep while cuddling.

But no, she doesn't want it like that. She absolutely needs the light to be on, otherwise she will be upset.

If I just start to get sleepy (wich I am because I want to sleep), she will get upset.

She absolutely wants to look me in the eyes, so cuddling to sleep is out of the question because I have to keep my eyes open too.

She also needs sweet talk, wich I like but not when it's forced like that. She literally asks me to say cute thing to her, and not just ""I love you more than anything"", she wants to ear what I think about her, how much my life is wonderful with her, etc... And honestly I have no problem with that, but only when it's spontaneous, not when it's forced. And we say cute thing to each other all day long so it's not like I never say it.

But the worst thing for me is that she will not want to turn off the light and cuddle to sleep until she is satisfied of our cuddles and my talks. And that can take some time. Sometimes 15min, sometimes 1 hour.

I know it is normal to just chill and sweet talk with SO, but it's always a necessity for here to do it right when I tell her I'm tired and I want to sleep.

If I say I'm just too tired, or that it's been some times already and that please could we turn off the light, she will just say ""No ! Don't say that !"" and will make her ""sad puppy face"", so I have no say in it.

Seriously, I think she's just being too clingy and childish. Is it unreasonable to just say ""good night I love you"", and then cuddle to sleep with the light off ? I don't even know anymore if she asks too much or if I don't do enough.

I feel like I have no control over when I can finally drift off to sleep, she has to decide when or else she'll cry for SEVERAL HOURS.

Honestly I wish I could just happily do all that, so that both of us would go to sleep without a problem, but I can't. It's so forced for me, it's too much to comply when I'm tired.

Could I have some insight ? What do you think ? Am I being unreasonable ?

Thanks for reading.

TIFU by trying to be my boyfriends hero,"Sorry in advance for mobile formatting.

So this happened yesterday night, here is some context.

I am a serial sprainer, in the 4 years my boyfriend has lived with me, I have sprained my ankle 7 times. I have tripped random stupid crap, dog toys, a rock in the grass, stairs, anything my ankles can find they will try to kill me on.

My boyfriend is always there, coddling me and nurturing my softball heels. I always thought one day I will be there to nurture his aches when he would fall.. but he never fell.

In the four years we have lived together he has never once slipped on ice, tripped on a rock, tumbled over an ottoman, or even dragged his foot across some slippery water.

That was until yesterday.

We were Uber Eats delivering in the lazy snowfall we had in Kansas, thinking we might get some decent tips. We delivered to this townhome complex, he got out to deliver while I stayed in. On his way back to the car his phone chimed for another delivery. He pulled out his phone, and instead of paying attention down he went on a patch of ice.

He didn't fall and crack, he fell down with enough grace to land on his butt and his elbow. Still, beggars can't be choosers. 

It was my turn.

I was going to coddle him now. I was going to nurture his swollen softball bumps. I was going to pick him up and help him to the car and baby him while he sniffled and reeled.

I was going to be the hero for once.. keyword being ""was.""

I lept out of the car. ""I can be your hero baby"" played in my head like elevator music. I felt my cape flowing figuratively behind my back.

Suddenly I was on the ground, my knee twisted at an 80 degree angle. My hip felt the twist and it hurt so bad, I thought I broke it. Unlike him, I did not fall gracefully. I hit the ground with such a thud that the lady in the car next to us got out ready to help me.

I laid there on the ground, air knocked out of me. Enrique Iglesias' ""Hero"" stopped abruptly and instead sirens were blaring in my head. I instinctively wriggled my feet to see which one was going to get too thicc for socks.

Everything seemed fine until I went to get up. Nope. My knee was kaput, and I let out a gasp in surprise.

Of course my boyfriend was up, not even bruised or limping, ready to swipe me up and buckle me into the car.

My boyfriend and this sweet lady was trying to help me up, but I elected to chubby lady crawl by the car so I could get up myself. I had them open the door and I crawled in, thanking the lady and buckling myself in.

As I sniffled and licked my wounds, he told me he was grateful that my first reaction was to try to help him. We laughed and joked about how funny it was. It was like a cartoon skit, I was Peter Griffin falling down and holding my knee, hissing between my teeth. One moment I was coming around the car the next I was on the ground with a shocked look on my face. I am still giggling about it.

He went to the store to get us some treats since we didn't want to end the night on a bad note, and once he disappeared into the store I just bawled and screamed. I think if anyone heard me they would think I was possessed.

I just wanted to be there for him for once, I felt so useless that even when he fell I couldn't help him. Instead once again I was the victim of a sprain, only I wish it was my ankle. This time it is my knee, and I would rather sprain my ankle twice again. 

I composed myself by the time he got back to the car with skittles.

Today I am confined to the bed, wishing we had our uber card already so we could get some crutches and gooey pizza. Now I am browsing reddit until my phone dies then napping while it charges.

He on the other hand, doesn't even have a bruise to show for it.

Boyfriend: 8
Me: 0

TL;DR: I fall down a lot, my boyfriend never falls. He finally fell for the first time in 4 years, and when I went to help him. I fell down too and ended up spraining my knee.

TIFU by accidentally asking a married woman for nudes,"obligatory ""this happened a couple weeks ago""

So me (21m) and my best friend (22m) have been best friends since high school. We're from the same town, and went to high school together, but ended up going to different colleges. Anyways, I'm super close with his entire family to the point of when summers come around, I end up spending entire days over at his house, sometimes when no one's there. His family counts me as part of their own family.

So his sister (24f) posted a story on instagram about her texting her boyfriend (23m) asking for help with a word puzzle. It was one of those ""even when I'm sick and can't hang out, I still need help with word puzzles"" things. Classic couple. Well I take it on myself to figure out the puzzle. So I swipe up and I'm thinking of what it could be, when I realize the letters could spell out ""nudes."" Eventually, I send it off as ""nudes? lol"" and put my phone away, thinking she'll realize what I mean and maybe she'll also be glad for the help.

A few minutes later, I get a message from an old coworker of mine (26f) that says ""oh my!!"" I think to myself, ""well that's weird, I haven't talked to her in forever"" so I open up Instagram. Turns out, while I had been sitting and trying to figure out the puzzle, Instagram had cycled through to the next person's story, which belonged to my former coworker who just so happened to have posted a picture of her 3yo son. My heart immediately sunk. I realized my mistake, and went straight into panic mode, showing screenshots of my best friend's sister's story and the like. She said she understood, but at the very best she figures that I was asking someone else for nudes and made up an elaborate story to cover up.

TL;DR Was trying to help a friend with a puzzle on instagram and thought the answer was ""nudes"" so I accidentally sent ""nudes? lol"" to a former coworker who had posted a picture of her 3yo son.

TIFU by engaging with antivaxxers while grieving,"Obligatory this didn't actually happen today and I'm using a throwaway for reasons that will become clear below. A few months back, a young family member passed away unexpectedly. A social media post was put up about it, and it went viral. There were lots of kind people who commented nice and sometimes even helpful things, but there were also several with more maligned intentions: first spammers, then a few people who just wanted to speculate wildly about cause of death in very hurtful and insane ways, and then the anti-vax community descended on it.  The latter collectively wanted us to know that they ""knew"" what happened, that we could ""understand the tragedy"" better if we just talked to them. 

All of this was a lot to process in my grief, and I started going through comments and reporting them. My anger level rose and before long I convinced myself that if I just messaged them and told them that the autopsy showed something 100% unrelated, that they'd lay off. That we would maybe even get an apology. As I wrote the first message, I convinced myself that people are decent and they just misunderstood probably. I continued writing to a few others. 

Yeah.... couldn't have been more wrong about that. I got back messages from each with different insane takes on it. Then I started getting messages from other people I've never heard of. 

At the private, unannounced service, two women came up to me in the parking lot wanting to hug. I assumed they were from the other side of the family, people I'd met but I just wasn't immediately recalling them, so I obliged. They expressed their sorrow, asked a few questions, and then began explaining that they had ""research"" that they'd like to share. One pulled out pages of handwritten notes about the dangers of vaccinations and how it relates to the deceased. Thankfully the employees of the funeral home helped me dispense of them quickly at least. 

I continued getting messages on social media and later learned that my info had been spreading from one social media group to another along with the any details they'd gleaned about the death from me. I eventually started getting phone calls even, though my phone number isn't out there in any easy to find place.  One person went to the length to write up over 20 pages of ""facts"" about the death including a section on how my loved one's death can further their cause politically. I couldn't even be mad; at least she was honest in her intention unlike the others. It's been months, and still I'm being hounded almost every single day by crazies all over the country. 

I've learned my lesson and don't respond or acknowledge them in any way now, nor have I for a while.  I haven't mentioned this to any of my family members because we're all so broken right now and this is way too much on top of it; I just hope none of them are getting the same treatment. 

TL;DR Anti-Vaxxers have been trying to ruin my life since I tried to reason with them after the passing of a loved one


Edit - A few takeaways:
* To those that reached out with similar experiences, I have been mortified to learn that this wasn't unique to me. Thank you for trusting me with your thoughts and stories.  I wish each of you the very best. 
* To those that reached out who have also lost a loved one recently, thank you. Genuinely. That's a brave thing to talk about with a stranger online, and it's been really healing for me to have conversations with so many of you. 
* I regret the user name I chose for this post and the wording of my TL;DR. I do believe in vaccinating but am sad to realize my words were a catalyst in spurring so much hatred towards those who don't.  The people that doxxed me are on the extreme fringe of that group, and that has become even more clear to me reading comments and messages from some of you.  I'm going to try to parlay this whole experience of wishing for more kindness from strangers during a tough time to trying to be as kind as I can be to strangers (and everyone else for that matter),  online and otherwise.",tifu

AITA for not sharing my prize with a mentally handicapped person in a contest?,"Every summer my community has a cookoff competition. Usually about 20-30 individuals or couples try to cook xyz and then they can win a portion of the entry ticket fees while the rest go into the community parks. It's not summer yet but they decided to do it early. This year it was pasta sauce. I've been going to these for years, ever since my wife and I moved here but this is the first time I entered as a competitor. It was earlier today.

One of the other competitors, I know her somewhat (only in passing) is a 15 or 16 year old with Asperger's Syndrome and autism. I don't know much about this condition evidently. I'll call her Jessica. I guess a lot of people got wind of her being a part of the competition that we had news crews here taping her to put on the news. We've never had this before as far as I know.

To make the story short, I won the competition. And $1,500. There's no second or third place prize, it's winner takes all. My wife and I were in shock because I like to think of myself as a decent home cook and take pride in my pasta sauce specifically, but to win a contest? We were tickled pink. 

We celebrated for about twenty minutes when the event organizers came to us. You might be able to guess where this is going, but they asked if we'd give our prize to Jessica as a ""gesture of good will"". They said they'd get some publicity since news reporters are here. We obviously said no, $1,500 is a lot of money. So they then asked if we'd like to split it, 50/50, with Jessica. Likewise we said no.

I guess some nearby patrons overheard the conversation and chimed in. Apparently we're assholes and jerks for not sharing the prize at least. After a few moments, there might have been 10 other people all clamoring to us about how we're a disgrace to the community, etc.

I dont think there is a need for me to see her again next week. So here's what happened. 

-She texted me she got home and about to sleep at 11:44 PM (she's closing deals in another city and has to rent a place)

-I tried to facetime her 11:51 PM just to say goodnight, she didn't pick up. I tried messaging her but no response. 

Remember that spare phone that's with me where her google account is logged in? I browsed on her activity history quickly to find out what shes up to, and was surprised there's a ""google assistant"" command recorded at 11:48 PM.

I played and listened. There's her voice and a voice of another guy. They were goofing around at the google home device. So yeah. 

I confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 AM.  She kept on denying she's cheating.

Then I laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

She finally admitted. 

I am single.

[F23] Found out that my [M29] boyfriend only settled for me and is not really attracted to me.,"Saw his text messages open and I did pry and when I catched a glimpse of ""break up with her"" (his friend wrote that), I couldn't help but read the entire conversation.

My boyfriend, who is 29, and has been with me for a year, is my first relationship and I'm his first as well. The difference between us, he's been looking for a girlfriend all through his 20s, while I wasn't too bothered/didn't care for guys much. (Busy with college, not much interest, not much need). 

He literally wrote to his friend that he trapped in the relationship. That he wishes he could just hook up and flirt with other girls but he also wrote he always gets rejected and has no chance.

Then he wrote how he would like to be with ""hot girls"" or even just date a hot girl and how he feels like he settled for an average girl.

I am insanely mad.

Honestly, being realistic, I'm a bit above average (My face is about 70th percentile realistically speaking and my body is quite fit/skinny), whereas, as sexy as I find him, is a bit unconventional looking/overweight. Probably average guy by US standards, but he is, (Not in my eyes!), not someone who should complain.

Although, I do believe everyone has the right to be with who they are attracted to. I like chunky guys, others do not. So I don't get why he is with me when I'm not attractive to him and I'm just straight up disappointed.

Besides, his need for hook ups - I don't get it. I'm more enthusiastic about sex than he is, I initiate it, and I would have it more often if he were willing to. 

What made me lose my sh*t is that he thinks he only ""settled"" for me.

I get the impression he's only with me so he won't die alone.

The prof had a lot of great LPT-type advice, but one thing he said in particular has stuck with me. He said most people will excessively worry and over-analyze a decision, but then do very little about it after the decision is made. We spend 95% of our energy pre-decision, then 5% after. However, he said a lot of the science shows that very often there isn't a ""right"" decision, but there are things we can do after that will make it right. For example, don't feel like there's a right/wrong decision to make when considering a job offer out of state. If you do decide to take it, once you're there do things to ""make it"" the right decision, like go out and make friends, work hard but keep a good work/life balance, etc. Change that 95/5 split to more like 50/50.

TIFU by flipping off my four year old neighbor.,"I'm a salty fucker. I'll admit that from the jump. I can't stand the family that lives across the street because their kid is always fucking freaking out and screaming, slapping shit, having tantrums, throwing shit across the street and into my yard...you name it, he does it. I can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. He's a little fucking hellion. 

His hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when I get into my car and leave for work. I got so sick of being stared at by this little asshole, so I flipped him off and gave him a nasty look as I was getting into my car. He immediately started screaming and crying. As I drove off, I felt...weirdly satisfied. Seriously, it was the most fulfilled I'd felt in WEEKS. So, I immediately did it again the next day, the next one after that, and the day after that. Each time he'd start screaming and freaking out. It made me bitterly happy.

This morning, as I was getting ready to leave, I saw the demon child in the window again...giving me THE STARE...and I flipped him off. Only this time I heard the bellow of ""HEY FUCKER!"". The kid's fucking dad had been standing behind him and I didn't see him. I sprinted into my car just as he came running out of the house. I got in before he caught up with me, but that still didn't stop him from throwing a potted plant at my tail light.

I'm at my girlfriend's place right now; my roommate tells me that the fucking psycho has been to the house twice looking for me. Kind of dreading going back; thinking that I'll just hang out here for the long weekend and hope it all blows over.

"[Norway] My classmate ordered custom sweaters for our class. The sweaters never came, and she got the money back over a year ago. Me and my other classmates never got our money back from her, she has it all. How do I get her to give my/our money back?","Over three years ago (January 2014) we ordered custom sweaters for our class. My classmate, let's call her Frida, received money from us and then placed the order. We were around 65 people ordering, and it costed around $25 per sweater, so she got around $1625

Long story short, the distributor scammed us and we didn't get the sweaters. Frida was clearly annoyed with us asking about updates, and stopped replying completely to anything related to it. In August 2017 she announced that she had gotten all the money back a while ago, and that we could send her our account numbers and she'd send out the money ASAP. Everyone were relieved and happy. After a few weeks, no one had gotten their money back from her and asked what was going on. One person said she got her money (Frida's best friend), but none of the others as i know of. Now it's over a year ago and no one's heard anything still, she hasn't posted or replied after she made the original post saying she got the money.

I sent her a PM the other day asking for an update. I said it's fine if she needs more time to do it for whatever reason, that i'm sure everyone's understanding, but that people just want a reply. That the silence is the frustrating part. She has completely ignored it.

What can I do to get my/our money back? I thought about telling her I'll report her for fraud if she doesn't reply or give my money back within two weeks. The report will most likely not result in anything, but maybe it'd push her to repay everyone?

&#x200B;

**Edit since I cant reply to people**: Thank you all for your advice, it's been really helpful. And you're right, the distributor didn't technically scam us since he did repay us after two years (or earlier if Frida had them a while). I do know there was an attempt to get the sweaters since she wasn't the only one working on getting our money back and talking to the distributor, and also because we got pictures of the sweaters at one point.

I'm not going to talk to the folk high school since the nature of the school is that you take one year there basically studying a hobby you have. Norwegians often call it a free-year to relax before going to uni, and figuring out what you want to do with your life. Since we left that school three years ago I don't think they'd appreciate getting involved. If it was a uni or highschool i would, though.

We are all spread across the country now, but I'll message everyone involved and ask them if they want to take legal action against her, at the same time as I message Frida letting her know that if she keeps ignoring us it'll have consequences. Hopefully she'll be scared into just repaying us, and if not then I'll follow your legal advice on what to do next. I won't let it go even if she gives me my money back but no one else.

TIFU by allowing my husband to come to dinner at my boss' house,"This actually took place a couple of years ago.

I had just gotten a brand new job that I was really excited about. So I was delighted when my boss - who I had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. 

Well, mostly delighted. My husband is..... well... he's the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. Because of this, I was worried about him coming along. 

By the time the day of the dinner arrived, I had become so anxious about it that I actually floated the idea by my boss that I wasn't sure if he would be able to make it. She was clearly taken aback and responded ""Oh no! I really hope he can, I have a dinner for 3 all ready to go."" Upon seeing her dismay, I assured her that I was sure he would find a way to be there. 

Well, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. It was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.

I had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. 

My boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when I noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. It was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you're not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.

I look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. Before I had a chance to fully comprehend what I was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. It hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. 

Now my husband does dumb shit, I already told you that. But he's not a crazy person. Usually when he does dumb shit I at least understand what he's thinking. There' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.

In this case I was just dumbfounded. I couldn't believe my eyes. I couldn't wrap my head around what was going on. I stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. 

I couldn't make any sense of what was happening, but I also didn't have time to try. I heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.

It suddenly sunk in that it didn't matter *why* he did what he did. He did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. 

I could feel the anger flush through my face. For a brief moment I contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. But No. This was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. Not like there was any possible recovery anyway.

My boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill There's the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. My boss and I are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.

He finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. I leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. 

He makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. Mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.

We all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn't there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.

As soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.

Turns out the dumbass didn't like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. My husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. He thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. 

A year or so later my boss hosted a Christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. My best friend, Jennie, was my +1.

TL;DR: Took my husband to dinner at my boss' house. He thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.

**Note:** My husband [told this TIFU from his perspective a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. Someone suggested I should tell it from my perspective. Hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)

**Edit:** OK Guys, I probably overplayed the ""dumb shit"" angle. Yeah, he's known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  From my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. Go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. My husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. 

**Edit 2:** No my husband is not on the spectrum or crazy, although I get that that may seem like a valid conclusion if all you know is this one event. The usual dumb shit is more of your everyday impulsiveness, like immediately saying the slightly inappropriate thing that comes to mind. If he would've done that, it wouldn't have shocked me at all. This, of course, shocked me, because he *normally doesn't do things that make him look insane*.  Not sure why some seem to be taking the ""he often does dumb shit"" to mean ""he often does completely insane things"", when I feel like I was making the exact opposite point. Oh well. Glad that most of you got some small bit of enjoyment out of your day from the story.  Also, we all have our faults. I joke about my husband not thinking things through, he jokes about my preoccupation with what others think of me, etc, etc.",tifu
AITA for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?,"Title says it all. My friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. Last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. She dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have Candy Crush on her phone.

So I told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. I reminded her that she enrolled in BJJ class when she dated a BJJ blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as I write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (Thank God the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

After dinner one of our other friends told me I shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but I think that there was nothing wrong with what I said because I just pointed out facts and I think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

AITA?

TIFU by pranking my girlfriend,"Yesterday I decided to prank my girlfriend by pretending to be my twin brother. Random as fuck, I know. But I've always wondered if I could fool her into thinking I was him. It was time. 

So, there I was, approaching my house and ringing my doorbell completely in character. I was wearing torn denims and converse sneakers, the complete opposite of what I normally wear but exactly the style to match my bro. I was walking like him, talking like him, sounding like him, hell, even smelling like him. 

My girlfriend eventually opened the door and saw deepfake me standing there. Regardless of how well prepared I was to play my twin brother, the moment I locked eyes with my girlfriend, I expected her to see right through my facade. She stared at me, confused. At first I wasn't sure if that was because she knew it was me or because she was surprised to see it's my brother.

There was only one way to find out. I said hi and dropped the ""I was in the neighborhood"" line. My girlfriend suddenly pulled me inside and slammed the door shut. 

Girlfriend: Are you out of your fucking mind showing up here like this?

Me: Uh... thought I'd visit.

Girlfriend: And I thought we agreed to stop seeing each other. 

Me: What do you mean?

Girlfriend: What the fuck do you mean, what do I mean? Whatever that shit was between us, it's over. Go home to your fiancee. 

Me: Enough. It's me. Your boyfriend. 

Girlfriend: You don't know when to give up, do you? 

I showed her my ID. I'd never seen so many mixed emotions flash across her face until that moment. At first she tried to play it off like she was in on the act all along and this whole interaction was nothing more than a cheating girlfriend narrative she fabricated on the spot just to fuck with me. I wasted no time calling my brother and fucking forcing a confession out of him. The motherfucker admitted to seeing my girlfriend on and off behind my back for months. When that call ended, so did my relationship with both of them.

TIFU by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral,"This happened a few years ago and I was living in Zimbabwe at the time, and I was having a pretty bad day, I was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. If youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

Half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
I get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....Then I here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so I wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. SO i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

I explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where I am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and I dont have the best memory so I didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, I take down his number so i can repay him later on. At this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. Im about 100 feet from the house and i see my Son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like Ive been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

I still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


So it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon.
My son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

TL;DR Got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and I somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

TIFU By Asking For Vagina In a Japanese Convenience Store,"For context, I'm on a vacation to Japan and has been staying at my friend's apartment for 3 days. To show a bit of gratitude, I wanted to cook for her so I decided to go for something simple like a Chicken katsu.

I've already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. This is the moment I realized that I was out of breadcrumbs so I have to go to the convenience store to get some. I am somewhat decent in Japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? No.

As I walked in the store, I couldn't find the breadcrumbs I was looking for so I decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:

Me: ""Sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?"" which literally translates to ""excuse me, where is da pussy?""

At this point I didn't realize that I mixed ""manko(pussy)"" and ""panko(breadcrumbs)"". The staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking I was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. I repeated the question 3 times, the staff's face switched from being confused to disgusted. After the change of the staff's expression, I realized that I fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. I then explained that I mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.

AITA for having an Almanac?,"A bit of backstory. I met my wife in the summer of 2008. She was working as the ice cream girl at a local restaurant. I had gone to pick up some boxes because I was moving. Out walked my Sara...it was close to the end of her shift. And working in this particular restaurant was a...dirty job to say the least. (Seriously, I don't care what DDD says, that place is gross.) She was covered in sweat from cleaning the machines, caked in all the dirt from that nasty little kitchen, had a grease stain on her cheek...and she was fucking beautiful. Her smile, her easy laugh, her obvious intelligence...I'm pretty sure I fell in love right then and there that wonderful May night. (inb4 ""tHAts sO OlD faShIOned!!!"" Don't care. When you know, you know.) I wasted no time in asking her out and we hit it off immediately.
It started after our first date. She had mentioned she loves lilacs. Me, being a 23 year old guy at the time, didn't know Jack or shit about flowers. But the way she talked about how much she loved them I knew I didn't want to forget that tidbit of information. So I wrote it down in one of those mini spiral notebooks. (Think what cops use to take notes.) This was The Almanacs genesis. Over the years I've written down information about my wife. Her favorite color, her favorite restaurants, her favorite books, movies she wants to see, etc. Basically all the little things I knew I would forget. Anything that struck me as worthy of remembering when she told me. I would go through it every once in a while so I could do something sweet for her. Fast forward to yesterday morning.
I get a call from her around 11am. ""What the fuck is The Almanac?"" (The Almanac is written on the cover. It's just a silly name that occurred to me a few years ago.) She obviously has it, and I don't lie to my wife, so I tell her. She gets really quiet for maybe half a minute and then says ""I always thought you remembered this stuff..."" tells me she has to run and hangs up. I get home from work last night and she's really dejected. I asked her what's wrong and she says the Almanac has cheapened every sweet thing I've ever done for her. She called it my ""playbook"" and said she felt betrayed. Mind you I've never showed it to a single soul nor have I even told anyone about it. Until yesterday I was the only person in the world to know of it's existence. (She also said she hasn't decided if I can have it back or not, and that she's thinking about destroying it.) I'm kind of heart broken. I feel like this should be an example of how much I love her. I'm terrified she's going to burn it. I WANT to remember all these details that make my wife who she is. That's why I write them down. I don't chronicle these things for brownie points or status. I do it because I love my wife. I hear so many wives bitch that their husbands don't remember shit, and I don't want to be that guy. So yeah, I took notes. And now I'm getting the silent treatment. Or at best single word answers.

Not surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...
Because of the level of noise I  the factory I have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. It just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. Everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...
At this point I wanted to just crawl into a hole, but I stood my ground and tried explaining myself

""I meant that as though you're a cow, not that I actually want to finger you""

This seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo's. 
I can't look Jess in the eye any more. Works gonna be a little awkward for a while...

Tl/Dr:  female workmate said I looked like I was going to go ""finger a cow"" so as my attempt a a witty response I said ""I'll finger you."" Now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references

Update: WIBTA if I told my daughter to find a different hobby,"Belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't. 

I won't lie when I say that I immediately ignored the majority of you telling me I was the asshole. Or maybe ignore is the wrong word. I think I expected that from the get go, so being told I ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe SAHMs"" rolled off my back. But, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) I was setting for her. There was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, I'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

Maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. I've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. I won't get into details because I'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that I'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. I gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (Surprise) I was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when I had to work at things I hated for the things we needed. It seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. That's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that I was so resentful. 

I like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (I never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to Michaels) but I can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. I helped her build a miniature restaurant last Saturday and I've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as I type this. I can't regain the time I've lost, but I can make sure she doesn't have to live the life I'm currently living.

Thanks for everything.",AmItheAsshole

I [M28] Just broke up with my girlfriend over something she [F27] posted on Facebook. Justified? Did I overreact?,"So we've been together about 7 months. We've had plenty of issues, but always managed to work through them and come out the other side a bit stronger. But something I found tonight just churned my stomach and it affected me so much I ended our relationship.

Some backstory for context: About 2 weeks ago we had a minor argument. It started in the morning, we paused the conversation for the day while we went to work, then talked about it that night. We both got kinda heated but eventually agreed that we were arguing about something ridiculous, and reached a compromise, and everything seemed fine.

Fast forward to tonight. We're laying in bed and I realize I never accepted her Facebook friend request. I literally never use Facebook, so this wasn't a point of contention or anything. But we weren't doing anything else so I decided to accept the request and check out her Facebook (She was right next to me the whole time).

What I found really upset me. Multiple shared posts that were obviously in reference to our relationship. They were just pictures of text that she had shared, not actually written herself.

The first one I found was this: ""Hey, here's a cool concept: treat the people that are important to you... Like they are important to you..."" I think ""Hmm, is this about me?"" I feel like I make her feel important all the time. I drive 30 minutes to her house every single day. She had a birthday and I did all the things that you would expect: Multiple presents, dinner, I offered a movie and drinks but she felt sick and we didn't go. I often buy her things just because. I offer her lunch nearly every day to show I'm thinking about her...

Ok, maybe I'm overreacting on that one I think. That post could be about anything or anyone, so I keep scrolling. I see another one: ""If you push me away, I promise you, you won't find me where you left me""... Hmm, this one obviously sounds like she's talking about our relationship. And I was a bit upset at seeing it. Especially considering I never felt like I was pushing her away. I spend literally every free moment I have with her. She got upset that I wanted some alone time. She says she doesn't desire it, doesn't understand why I need it, so I pretty much did away with my private time to spend more time with her. We are constantly doing things together, and make plans to do things and go places. I never felt like I was pushing her away. If anything, I felt like I spent most of my free time trying to think of things we could do together.

I keep scrolling, and I found the one that hurt me the most: ""Don't be mad when someone else starts to appreciate the person you took for granted. What you won't do, someone else will.""

That one absolutely killed me. I never thought I was taking her for granted. And the thought of her not feeling appreciated kinda floored me. On top of that, the implication is that she wants to find someone else who apparently appreciates her more than I do...

I confronted her about these posts. She said they don't mean anything. That she didn't even think about it, and that it took less than a second to hit the share button, so it's not a big deal.

I took a bit to collect my thoughts, and then I went back through our text messages to each other. Turns out that every single one of these posts was made when we were in the midst of an argument/spat. That last one, the one that hurt me so much, was shared by her during the day after we had the minor argument and before we had talked it out that night.

It just felt so terrible. Like, we have a very minor disagreement about something and you're thinking about finding someone else? That's what it seems like to me. Am I out of my mind for thinking that? She made me feel like I was. She said I was overreacting. That she felt that way in the moment, but not now. But I can't stop myself from thinking ""If you feel this way after a minor argument, how must you feel after a serious one?"".

Then there is the whole issue of airing out our dirty laundry to anyone that happens to be friends with her on Facebook. Anyone with a brain knows what those posts are about. By sharing them, you are essentially announcing to the world ""I'm having relationship problems!!!"". I can't help but think about the things her family and mutual friends must think about our relationship considering how often she is sharing things like that (They were all posted within this past month). To an outsider, I must seem like a fucking asshole. Not treating her right. Not respecting her. Not making her feel important.

I just felt disgusted. I felt like I was going to vomit. I just kept seeing the words ""What you won't do, someone else will"". I know she didn't write them. But she thought them. She agreed with them. She broadcast them to the world.

I told her I knew myself well enough to know I wouldn't forget it. That anytime we had any minor argument, I would be thinking ""Guess she's gonna go find someone who respects her more than I do"". I don't think I could deal with it. Knowing that anytime we fight, she is having these feelings. Instead of wanting to work it out, she is thinking about finding a new partner...

I broke up with her within an hour of seeing the posts. It was ugly. I feel bad. I feel tired. I've had no sleep and I have to work in like 3 hours. I don't even know why I'm posting this. The relationship is over. Maybe I overreacted, maybe I was justified. I just know it felt right.

Edit: lots of people saying I jumped to conclusions. I do not feel I did. The conversation went like this:

Me: *scrolling through her feed for the first time* ugh, why do you post stuff like this? There is a lot of them. (This was more just general dislike at posting such childish things)

Her: why? Do you not like that I do that?

Me: I mean... It kinda feels like you're just announcing our relationship issues to everyone.

Her: but those posts could mean anything. They could be about anyone.

Me: I just have a feeling that if I went through our texts and found the days and times we were arguing, they would line up with these posts.

Her: yeah, maybe some of them...

We left it at that for about 10 minutes, then I decided to actually check those times and dates. They all lined up, I went through the first four shared quote thingies and they all matched with times we were arguing about something. I stopped at four because the pattern was clear.

I then confronted her, and she confirmed she posted them during arguments. I may have jumped to a conclusion, but Imo it wasn't a very far leap. And she confirmed that I was right.",relationship_advice

"My brother molested my girlfriend's niece and everything is as bad as you can imagine, I don't know what to do at this point?","Yes, he's in prison and will be for a long time. Meanwhile the niece is receiving therapy. English is not my first language so please bare with me.

For context my brother is a lot older than me and we never really connected, yet he was/is a mama's boy and our mother encouraged us to see each other. I obliged because our mother started developing Parkinson's disease and I didn't want her upset over her darling boy and second son not talking. I've always known my brother to really like chatting up women and people called him a 'sex pest' 'creep' or a wannabe 'lady's man' yet never in a million years did I think he would have a thing for or do anything to children. People still believe he is innocent. Another thing to mention my brother is a very confident person, calculated, and manipulative, very few people can tell he's lying.

With my gf we dated for a year, moved in together and had a generally normal relationship. My brother of course tried to hit on her multiple times and she brushed him off then told me which caused major strain with me, my brother, and mother. Especially because my brother and mother tried blaming my gf, yet I know what my brother is like and my mother is in denial about it. For a period of time I banned him away from our house. However later my gf's sister, BIL, and niece came to stay because her sister was pregnant with the second child and we were discussing leaving the niece at our place because the baby was going to require surgery and a hospital stay after birth that could last up to a month.

We decided to keep my gf's niece with us for the time especially so the niece could stay with her aunt. My gf and niece are fairly close so we thought it was a good idea especially with the baby while both parents were stressed and worried. Then my POS brother had to fuck it up like the cunt he is. My mother started hounding me over allowing my gf's family over but not allowing my brother over so I obliged under heavy supervision he was around. My brother was being mysteriously nice and well behaved, he also was buying us things, playing games with the niece so she actually did like him and was excited when he was around.

My brother then decided he was a handy man and helped with minor adjustments to the house, he would find excuse after excuse to come over to the point I was finding it partly daunting. My gf just ignored him and I didn't realise he was losing interest in my gf at time. When everything came out the signs became clear mainly after what occurred. In a very short period of time my gf's niece started becoming sad which we thought was because she was missing her parents so we bought her lots of toys, read to her, took her on trips to beach, zoo, shows, let her stay up, watch her favourite shows, and so on trying to make everything fun as possible. What we didn't notice was my brother was sometimes alone with her for very short periods of time which he used to his advantage.

It all come out when my gf noticed her niece was oddly quiet in the bath her niece is usually singing and splashing in the water, (my girlfriend went into the kitchen to get a cup or something it was only a few minutes), my brother was meant to be outside helping in the garden, I was in the garage when I heard screaming. I ran inside and my gf was beating up my brother who was trying to restrain her. I held onto him and my gf grabbed my niece and locked them in a room then called the police. My brother was saying he didn't do anything and ""accidentally"" walked in on the niece then my GF attacked hence I knew immediately he was lying. The police arrived and arrested him.

We found out my brother was actively grooming the niece then started getting physical with kissing and inappropriate touching, then my GF found him molesting her niece in the bath tub. He would use whatever minimal time he had to get to her, sometimes the amount of time he used was so brief it was like he was enjoying the thrill of possibly getting caught. With the bathtub incident he was meant to be outside and like the snake he is he waited for an opportunity to strike. It wasn't like the niece was left alone for hours on end, the door was left open so my gf could hear her while she went to get something then comeback. The niece is in primary school and can be left alone for brief periods of time. No one thought he would be doing this.

When we went to court several women came forward about sexual harassment from him, he would target women in his workplace or close by him with behaviour that he could try excuse, he was a peeping tom, and he would target women when they're drunk offering a ride home or something. It literally came off as a game to him where he pushed boundaries and limits to see what he could get away with. Shockingly he apparently developed a form of humanity and admitted to what he did to the niece saying he has never done anything to a child prior and wanted see what it would be like. Just a horrible person. 

My mother refuses to believe he did it and I went no contact with her because I'm honestly sick of her shit. I later remembered when my brother and I were children he was the golden boy and she paraded him around like an item, he could do nothing wrong and never had consequences for his actions. It's also the main reason our parents divorced because she refused to see what she was raising and wouldn't allow our father to get him therapy. I'm pretty sure she's a narcissist who raised a sociopath. I had moved in with our dad after the divorce because I hated the pair of them and before our dad died in my 20s, he told me how our relatives would always talk about how lovely and kind I am yet say they would 'keep an eye' on my brother while my dad said no matter what he did he couldn't feel love for or from my brother as if it was just missing from him. That of course scared me yet 15 years+ later when I'm in my 30s and my brother is almost 50 years old it was sort of lost on me.

Now with the relationship with my girlfriend. We have been sleeping in different rooms with limited talking. Her family basically blames me and my entire family and to some degree my GF. My gf told me she cannot face her sister because she feels as if she failed her family and ruined her niece's life when it's my POS brother's fault. I feel as if I ruined my GFs and her niece's life because of what my brother did. I'm trying to get us both into counselling/therapy while my gf has requested leave off work and I am preparing to too. After everything was said and done with my brother in prison, being home is utterly horrible and I have no idea what to do to even slightly repair this. This is the first time I've cried in years and I feel terrible for my GF's niece, gf, and GF's family. I do not know what to do next, I also keep wishing I terminated my brother when I had the chance. I have never hated anyone more in my life while I think my mother should be locked up with him.",relationship_advice
Boyfriend got very drunk and was brutally honest about our relationship,"My bf and I have been together for over 4 years. When we first dated, we were both in college, but due to financial reasons he had to drop out to support his family. We stayed together long distance until I graduated and moved back home. We have lived together for about 2 years now. 

Life was very rough for him when he dropped out. His parents had hospital bills and he couldn't make enough to support them so he had to take out loans. He is still paying those loans up to this day, and works 14 hours a day to just make meets end. Because of this, I have lent him money over the years. I was very fortunate in my situation where I went to school debt free and found a job immediately after graduating. I have been paying rent for him in addition to lending him money and he slowly pays me back whenever he can. One thing about our relationship, we have very different personalities. I am a perfectionist and have a way of doing everything whereas he is very laidback and carefree.

Last night, he got very drunk and as he was throwing up, was very honest with me about our relationship. He told me several things: he feels like he is indebted to me for helping him out in life and that he feels he needs to make me happy whenever he can. Because of this, he will let me have my way, even if it pisses him off. My perfectionist habits make him very stressed out at times and it is making him unhappy. Sometimes it is very difficult to be with me because of my attitude towards doing things. (For example, we moved last week and I wanted everything moved in a day whereas he is a slow mover.) It makes him feel less of a man because he has to borrow money from his girlfriend, and that sometimes he'll pay me before paying his credit card bills even if he gets hit with the late fee. But he still loves me, not because he is obliged to due to money. 

I am very confused about our relationship right now. He will not remember this when he wakes up, but I don't know how to approach him with the things he said. I love him very much and want him to be happy as well, even though sometimes our personalities clash. But if it is so difficult to be with me because of our situation, what should I be doing?

Edit: I've changed the ocd to perfectionist. I'm so sorry to everyone I offended!

Edit 2: I'm crying at work from all the supportive and caring comments. Thank you to everyone who responded, I love each and every one of you, even the rude people because they probably don't get a lot of love in their lives. 

A little background on him dropping out: his dad had stomach surgery and couldn't work. Because of this, his mom took care of his dad, while also caring for his grandma full time. Neither parent was in a position to work, so he had to step up. That was years ago, his dad has made a wonderful recovery and his mom now has a part time job.",relationship_advice

"Every year my wife has spent upwards of $1500 on new Xmas decorations she just throws away after New Years. She promised me last year was the last but I just found a huge bag of decorations in the garage. I'm disgusted. What do I do here? (Both 34, two kids)","Wife and I have been married 10 years, we have two kids 5 and 3. Wife is a good person but has no concept of money, budgeting and spending. I've gotten her following a pretty decent budget but she comes and blows her was during Xmas. 

I don't mind her being generous to friends and family. It brings her joy and I appreciate that. But what disgusts me is her ""need"" to spend money to decorate. Every single year she goes completely overboard and essentially buys an entire brand new set of Christmas decorations. Everything from tree holders to candle stands to ornaments. Every year it's all brand new and every year she's so exhausted by the end of the holiday to store and organize it all that she just throws it all away.

To best exemplify how it works let's talk about stockings. She will go to target, see cute stockings buy four of them. Then she'll go to world market and see even cuter stockings and she'll buy four of them there. Then she'll see one at Walmart which features lighting McQueen for my son and buy it and buy one for my daughter to be fair. So we'll have 10 new stockings for Xmas and all of them will be thrown in the garbage on January 2nd. The rub is my grandma hand made stockings for the entire family, so we don't even need any, let alone 10. Replace stockings with any other Xmas item and that's how it goes until we have $1500 at least in credit card bills for stuff that's just going in the garbage.

Last year we couldn't afford it all so we ended up paying interest until about April on her xmas purchases. I told her enough was enough and frankly I'm also sick of the amount of junk that were just sending to the land fill. We went over all the decorations we already have and how we could just use those. She agreed.

However I was getting ready for work (I work extra Saturday shifts in Novmeber and December to afford the holidays, another post I guess) and found two huge bags of all brand new Xmas decorations hidden in the garage. I would guess it's $300-$500 worth of stuff. I'm so disgusted I can hardly see straight. 

I'm up at 4:30 on a Saturday to work my ass off for stuff that were going to pay interest on that is going to give us 20 minutes of joy that will rot in the landfill. I feel exhausted and just want to get into bed and tell her to go work. 

What do I do here? Sitting in my truck really fighting the urge to go grab the kids and move into my moms house until we get to some resolution here.

You bitch because at the end of all this emotional and physical and executive work, she's too fucking tired to carry in and organize all the deco boxes, carefully wrap each ornament, nestle it into another tissue cradle she makes, carry out the full boxes and find somewhere to put them where your untended crap overflows the shelves and leaves her with the job of reorganizing the entire place to jenga everything together. But you'll sit on your butt and bitch without lifting a hand. Hey, I've got an idea, Mr. Man. GET ON YOUR TINY SNOWFLAKE FEET AND PUT THE FUCKING DECORATIONS AWAY. Then there they are, next year.

"Neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs","For the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

At first I just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. However after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

I've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

She will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. I've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. Before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

Numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. I don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

When she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when I'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. Before I started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. Now since I've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. Somehow this is my fault.

Now I'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred German Shepard, an English bulldog and a mix Sheppard/bulldog).

I just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. I have a pool and if she falls in when I'm not home she could very well drown. That's why I installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, I truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

I've called the local child and family services office (CPS) several times in the past two months to report it because I feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. I have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that I've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when I open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

I feel like I've done everything I can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. I just have no idea what to do now? I've debated calling the police when she enters but I don't know how that will escalate.",legaladvice

But if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

What I'm talking about here is an incident where my fianc√© used her best judgement to step in and ask a child to not throw golf balls at a window because there were other kids nearby.

Do people actually eat ass?,"Like do people actually use their mouths and tongues on other people's assholes. Seems kinda disgusting to me. Do people really find pleasure out of that? I see the whole millennials eat ass meme and I can't tell if it's serious or not.

AITA for confronting my kids private school teacher about blue blood?,"So this happened about a year ago but I'm curious. My wife said I drug it out too far and was an asshole. 

So my kid comes homes from school telling me he learned something new at school, and he was excited. So I was excited too and asked him what. He said ""we learned our blood is blue today!"". 

I felt a little bad but said to him ""you know I was told that as a kid too, but I've learned that's actually not true."". I said I can show him evidence from the internet when we get home. We get home and I show him and he believes me. 

The next day he goes to school and tells his friends and even the teacher that that was incorrect. His teacher tells him no, I am the one who is wrong not him. My kid even said he believes his teacher. So I show my son more proof that I am right, but he is still skeptical.  

The next day I compose a nice email, not rude. Simply stating I told my son we didn't have blue blood and he told me that you told him I am incorrect. I give him some links showing we don't have blue blood.  

He emails me back saying I am still incorrect. At this point my wife asks me to drop it. I am upset and I don't want to drop it. As of now my own kid does not believe me, even after showing him proof. 

So I email the teacher again and ask him if he can provide me evidence that he is correct because I cannot produce anything showing he is correct. He finally relents and says I must be right. 

But at this point, I now need him to tell my son he was incorrect so my son will believe me.  My wife asked me to please stop but I didn't. I emailed him asking him to please tell my son and the classroom that he was incorrect so they don't go through life with incorrect information. 

He did tell the kids he was wrong and that's the end of that. 

Now I feel that I have taught my son a few good lessons.  A) it's ok to question things including those authorities B) it's ok to stand behind what your beliefs are especially with evidence C) it's ok to be wrong(the teacher) we can all be wrong, but when presented with proof, it's ok to change your opinion based on evidence.

Was I an asshole for dragging it out?

Edit. To those calling me an asshole? What is the best way to handle this then? I'm serious, genuinely curious of the proper way to handle this?

Edit: well this blew up. I'll accept my nta. But these people telling me my reasons for doing this are self centered? Nope. Couldn't care less. But I wanted my kid to challenge authority, absolutely, and to stand by your convictions.

Final edit: showed the wife this. She said that I was correct in following through. But I was the asshole because she had to listen to me complain about this guy at home for days. 
Thanks for the conversations though!",AmItheAsshole
My friends house was stolen [OH],"LOCATION: OHIO

Hello,

I am writing this on behalf of my friend and co-worker who is fully aware I am posting this.  Below is a description of the situation, taken and edited for privacy, from a post he made alerting his friends and family of what has happened.

>My husband and I were recently paid a visit last month by someone claiming to own our home. ""I'm sorry..this is going to sound really crazy and I know you have lived here a long time, but I own this house."" Which just happens to be the home we purchased 8 years ago and where our family have been living and paying our mortgage. I immediately asked him to leave our property and contacted our local police department while he angrily began taking pictures of our house and vehicle in the driveway. To my surprise when I searched our county auditor's web page, there were indeed two transfers made in July of this year. We were never made aware of or signed any transfer of ownership. When I contacted our mortgage company to whom we make payments, they were not aware of any title changes either but they did make it clear that we are still responsible to make all of our mortgage payments.  
>  
>We made a trip to our county records department but no one could answer how our home was seemingly purchased right out from under us and the deeds transferred without us or the mortgage bank being involved. The department head and supervisor at the records department were just as baffled as we were.  The previous owner who sold us the home is deceased and the original lender is no longer in business. We then received legal council and filed a police report last month due to multiple very aggressive attempts to gain access to our home by a man claiming to represent the ""current owners.""  Apparently, our house should never have been sold to us and has recently been sold right out from underneath us. We were advised to submit a title insurance claim and begin preparations to move.  
>  
>We found out that there was a case that involved our house and the ""Detroit Fire and Police Pension property scam"" out of Michigan. That case opened in 2008 and the final judgement was made 4 years later. We purchased our home using a ""Survivorship Warranty Deed"" with what we assumed was a clean title, but we were wrong.   We have requested that the corporation evict our family and not return to our home again.  Fortunately, no one has returned since.  We were alarmed when the supposed ""new owners"" received their first piece of mail at our residence which happened to be a water bill. They have made yet another transfer WITHOUT NOTICE.  I got in contact with the water company only to get an apologetic, ""I am sorry Mrs. #####., Only the owners can change it back and we can not give you any balance or account information.""

While they have sought legal counsel, they are desperately seeking any additional information they can get regarding this situation.  Everyone they speak with seems baffled by what has happened.   I will run all questions through him before responding for complete accuracy.",legaladvice

It really helped me take a proactive approach instead of letting worry sif in the drivers' seat. I looked in my bank account this morning, and the purchase was reversed! In addition to advice regarding contacting my bank, you guys gave excellent advice about what to do in a situation where I might fall short on food again, which can definitely happen when you're living paycheck to paycheck, and I hope anyone who ever finds them self in this situation remembers they can always visit a local food pantry in an emergency food shortage! I only posted that original post on this forum, so any similar posts on other forums aren't me, but having this happen made me aware of it being a possibility and also something others might go through. IMy situation had a happy ending, and I believe a lot of that had to do with you guys! Thank you! 

I forgot to add my location Irvine, California to this post.

Thank you guys again for being so kind and supportive!

[UPDATE] My (21f) boyfriend's friend (both 22M) tried to spike my drink.,"This is the link to my original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/d0vrd5/my\_21f\_boyfriends\_friend\_both\_22m\_tried\_to\_spike/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d0vrd5/my_21f_boyfriends_friend_both_22m_tried_to_spike/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

After reading everyone's advice and telling my boyfriend, we went to the police station. We spent most of the night there.  I told them about what I saw and that he wouldn't let me go easily when I wanted to leave. They asked me lots of questions: if I am sure, what the glass looked like, what the pill looked like,  how drunk I was, how drunk he was, if I had ever liked him etc. It was very uncomfortable but they had to get all the information.

The police suggested that they take my report to have a file ready but said they can't arrest him or go to his place or check anything as it's too late. They did say it would be a good idea to try to message him and get information from him that would be proof of what he did, screenshots and all. I am not sure if I can do that, he has sent me a message asking how I was that I showed my boyfriend but I haven't answered him yet. I am guessing he's going to start thinking something is up since he has texted my bf who hasn't answered him either.

After coming back from the police, we just decided to get some rest and talk about this today. We haven't yet, we were both exhausted and there was a lot of crying on my part. So that's it for now. I don't want to have to talk to him or face him but I will have to anyway. This is all just so confusing, but thank you all for your support and advice.

Edit: I just want to give some more information after reading all the comments:

\-I didn't feel the police was victim blaming, I am sorry if I made it seem that way, but they did explain they had to get as much information as needed and I did tell them everything: there is no history between me and S, we became friends through my bf and common interests and I showed them messages between us, they are mostly about when we're meeting with others and music exchanged. They talked to my bf too and they didn't try to say I made it up in anyway and seemed to believe me. I am in a big city in Europe, I guess they are used to dealing with cases like that. The officer who talked to us was very nice and said we reacted very well to this, advising my bf that turning it physical would not be a good idea and even telling me I could come directly to him if I felt threatened by S.

\-I am not makng this up, I have read comments suggesting I did and it honestly hurts. I am not crazy and I never wanted things to get this messed up. This guy was my friend, as are the others in the group.

\-My bf and I aren't telling S we went to the police. I gave my boyfriend my phone to text him as me if he wants but I can't do it. I also showed him the posts on here so he can have everyone's opinions on the situation.

I am sorry to seem this pathetic but it is not the easiest thing mentally. And I am so grateful for the support, I wouldn't have told my bf and let alone the police without it.",relationship_advice
AITA for reporting my car stolen when my sister took it after I told her not to?,"My sisters car broke down 6 months ago because of her own stupidity. I won't go into it here but she ignored the advice of a mechanic and because of that her car broke. I decided to be nice and offer my sister my car until she could get hers fixed as i could bike to work while she needed to drive. She did not get her car fixed for some reason. She claimed to be saving money to do so but every time her paycheck came she spent it. My parents have even offered her a loan to fix her car but she refused. Along with all of this, she has been abusing my generosity and taking my car all day and night. I told her she could use it for work but is seems to her that is a free pass to use my car, not fill it with gas, and take it when I specifically tell her not to.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been needed to get to work very early and I really don't feel like riding my bike 6 miles at 3 in the morning so I told my sister she had 30 days until I took the spare key from her and she is no longer allowed to use it. That was 32 days ago. Yesterday morning she woke up specifically before me to take my car (at 2:30 in the morning). I called her and demanded she bring it back but she just hung up on me. because of this I reported it stolen.

&#x200B;

My sister was arrested 30 minutes later and my parents had to go bail her out. My sister is now facing charges for unauthorized use of a car and my parents and her are pissed. They claim I want way to far here but honestly, i feel justified. My parents are worried if she's found guilty she will loose her job but in my opinion, it's her own fault. Am i wrong here?

It's such a widespread norm that literal mutilation of a newborn isn't even a shocker. Imagine just taking out an eye, or half his tongue, baby crying because he just entered the world and already being torn apart, but it's religious views!

I have nothing against people who are adults and became circumcised as an adult. Go for it but do whatever the hell you want to your body.

TIFU by asking Reddit which ethnic group to exterminate,"Today I had been looking forward to the qualifying for the Formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing Reddit whilst also watching some older Formula 1 footage on YouTube. So it got me wondering, ""Some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they're just boring and far too controlled"". So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...'Hitlerish'. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn't be able to sleep if I didn't open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I've been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let's see what I go back to now...

Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/

EDIT: Thank you for the gildings you're all giving me, it's rather overwhelming.

The original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/Formula1 somehow. 

As of 19:42PM GMT, I still have over 600 responses to read through. I will be reading them all, but I won't necessarily be responding to them all.

I'm really glad that I could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn't the original intention, but it's a great positive to take away from this experience!

EDIT 2: UPDATE - At around 20:20PM GMT, I opened up AlienBlue on my iPad to read these comments faster than on the official Reddit app, and when I started from there I had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, I now have 976 unread messages -.-

EDIT 3: UPDATE - It's now 21:09PM GMT, I did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it's back up in the 4 digits. I am seriously sleep deprived right now, I have been awake since 16:00PM yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. Finally they've subsided and I'm feeling really tired now, so I shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. Goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. I honestly didn't think this TIFU post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

EDIT 4: Finally I'm able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. Back down under 1000 left to go now, and it's been a truly interesting experience. I didn't realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, I also didn't expect some of the truly deplorable messages I have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. It's 6:00AM GMT here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

EDIT 5: Final edit, I'm now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17AM. It's been great to see this happen, and I'm sorry to those who thought Reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

Told that my eight hour shift is now thirty six hours and I'll be fired if I fall asleep. [Washington],"Like the title says. I work at a 24-hour post as a security guard and we are majorly understaffed. 

I showed up at 2PM expecting to work 2-10 and another 2-10 tomorrow. 

My boss tells me there was a call-off and could I please show up at 10am tomorrow to work 10-10. I agreed. 

My boss went home and called me two hours into my shift to tell me my relief would not be showing and that he couldn't find a replacement. 

I told him I could either work overnight or pull a 12 tomorrow, but I cannot work 32 hours straight and safely drive home. 

I also have a medical condition I need to take medication for and a missed dose will give me debilitating withdrawal symptoms. 


My boss informed me that he was going to bed and would be turning off his phone. 


It's 11:30PM and I've tried contacting everyone up the chain. Nobody has so much as an estimate as to when I can go home- they're all asleep or punting the problem to someone else (who is asleep). 

If I leave, I'll be fired. If I fall asleep, I'll be fired. 

What's my best move?

(Edited for spacing)

Edit: it turns out what my bosses are doing isn't illegal but I seriously doubt they'll fire me when it means they'll be down three workers instead of two. 

I've informed the only person I can reach (my direct supervisor) that I'll be leaving at a set time, whether they've found a replacement or not.

Second edit: I got my supervisors spoken permission to go home and take my meds/eat, and unspoken permission to curl up on the dirty floor someplace off camera to sleep.

Thank you everyone for your help.

FINAL EDIT: I'm home and I've slept, had a good meal and taken my meds. My next shift isn't for a couple days.

"TIFU by diving into a pool headfirst, degloving my skull, and breaking my neck in 3 places.","Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cfbo0i/tifu_by_diving_into_a_pool_headfirst_degloving_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share 

As per usual this didn't happen today but this past Saturday. I (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. One of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. So we hop out and me, being the genius that I am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. I go to take a running leap in and as I'm pushing off the deck, I feel my foot slip. I end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. I come to as I'm floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause I need to breath, but they don't respond. Most of my friends see me and think I'm joking, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. They stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. In another incredible bout of luck, once I'm stabilized on the deck I can move my legs again. Friends call an ambulance (to which I am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks US healthcare prices) and once I get to the hospital I'm placed in the trauma ICU and CT scanned. I then find out I've pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. And now I get bed rest and at least 3 months in a C collar. So yeah, don't dive in the shallow end folks! 

Tldr: dove in the shallow end, wrecked my neck like a hydraulic press

TIFU by playing a joke on a colleague who took it seriously. I ended up losing a vacation day and got a disciplinary action in my file.,"I worked for a Workman's Compensation provider some time ago and there was a guy in my department - Todd - who was mildly annoying.  Nice enough guy, but just a bit juvenile.  He enjoyed pranks and was always trying to get a rise out of everyone in the office.  Little things like taping our computer mouse or asking ransom for the return of our coffee cup. It got to be enough, so I decided he needed some payback.

He paid out a claim that was HUGE and he was nervous about it. I don't know why, but it just seemed like an opportunity to me, and so I waited. About a week later, in a team meeting (everyone was in on it but Todd), I said that there were some payouts that were kicked upstairs for review and that it was a potentially serious situation.

A couple of days after that, I stopped and poked my head into his office and asked, ""Did you payout x-amount on the Smith file?"" He said he had and asked me why. I just walked away.

The following Monday, I had my plan laid out fairly well.  After sharing the detail with my brother-in-law, he suggested that I borrow his black surplus Impala cop-car and park it at the entrance. Then, early that morning, I went about putting crime scene tape across the door to Todd's his office.

I had the receptionist in on it too. When Todd came in that morning, she would look at him, then fumble for the phone, turn her back and mumble into the receiver.

Todd made it to the top of the steps when I rushed up to him and said, ""Dude - go, just go!""

""What the hell are you talking about?"" He asked.

""Just turn around and leave - drive, drive anywhere, just go!""

He shrugged me off, but I could tell that he was a little rattled. He turned the corner to see his office door blocked with crime scene tape and for a moment, he froze in his tracks. He walked past his office and around the corner, out of sight. He ended up slipping out through the stairwell.

He was gone for nine hours. I had to call his wife to get a message to him that it was a joke.

His absence meant that management got involved. I had to confess to being the perpetrator of the prank. I got a stern talking-to (my boss was trying really hard not to laugh) and I lost a vacation day as a result, but it was worth it.

Todd doesn't tape my mouse anymore.


TL;DR  I played a practical joke on a colleague and he took it seriously


*Edit:  I posted this thinking it might be amusing to a few of you and I wasn't expecting much of a response from it.  I have to say, I've enjoyed the pissy posts the most, the ones saying I went too far.  Yes I did, which is why this was a FU.  For any of you worried about Todd, he's fine.  This actually happened in 1993 and I posted it because Todd and I were remembering it recently (and laughing) and so I had it on my mind.  Yes, I still work with him (a different company now) and we've been friends for almost 25 years.*",tifu
My son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family,"I'm going to preface this by saying I love all three of my sons equally. They are 29, 24 and 22. It is my unequivocal truth.

It's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

After years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and I have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. We let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

I disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but I have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

After losing literally everything after my divorce, I have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. All three of our sons work in the business.

A week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. I was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. My oldest son managed to see it.

Our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. My oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

I feel like I have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. My ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

If she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

The plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

My son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. He stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and I. Our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

I am devastated. I have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him I want the will to be changed to split everything equally. But the damage is done.

He's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). His brothers and my wife and I are so hurt hearing this. It couldn't be any further than the truth. It's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

He has refused to come in to work since the past week and I've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

I don't know how to fix this. He won't take my calls.

My ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on Facebook that I am considering legal action over. But I know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

I'm not sure how to salvage this. And I am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. My younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. It's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. My wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

TL;DR My oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. But now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after I have tried to fix it.",relationship_advice

An hour or so later we were on our way to a county facility, so we could all be interviewed by a couple of detectives from the county prosecutor's office. Once interviews were over the county detectives sat down with my wife and I to let us know my son had given them some actionable information and they intended to act relatively quickly. The detective who interviewed the children had tears in her eyes. 

From there we went home.

That afternoon, Neighbor knocked on the door, looking to play with the kids. I opened the inner door (left the storm door closed) and made it clear he needed to go away, which he did. Soon after I went to night school, asking my wife to stay in doors with the kids for the night, which she did. When I got home, she said nothing else had occurred.

For the most part, Wednesday was quiet and relatively normal. We did not see Neighbor all day. Wednesday night, we came to know why. A detective called to let us know Neighbor had been taken into custody on Tuesday night (while I was at school) and would remain in custody for a few days until his hearing (I assume arraignment).

Thursday morning a woman from the state DCF/CP&P office came to the house. She made a cursory check of the house and interviewed my wife & I together. To my mind, this was actually a good thing.  She was able to let us know that Neighbor had been charged with 2 counts (I don't recall exactly what they are). She also provided 2 other important facts:

1 ‚Äì Neighbor had a history, albeit old (late 80s, early 90s) and in California.

2 ‚Äì Neighbor had admitted the act to the detective that arrested him on Tuesday evening.

From there, she advised we were entitled to have my son evaluated by a state specialist and possibly therapy if necessary. We will need to have them check in with us once a month until the case is closed on their end, and the evaluation etc. will necessarily extend that time frame, but we opted to go this route anyway.

While she was there I asked if she knew what the likely penalty was (she did not), and whether or not she thought we should pursue a restraining order, if Neighbor was likely to be free again soon. She was unsure and promised to check in with the detectives on the subject.

Friday (yesterday) afternoon, we received a call from the county detective. She informed us that Neighbor's hearing was set for Monday and that his lawyer intended to ask that he be released to his home, with an ankle monitor, for the period between the hearing and his trial. She wanted to ask for our input as to how hard the prosecutor should push to have Neighbor remain in custody.

Here's the thing. Neighbor, so far as we can tell, actually lives with a family‚Ä¶ and they have small children. I advised the detective that we were ok with Neighbor being 'home', so long as he was confined to (approximately) his property. She confirmed that would be the case, and that a 'no contact' order would be in place. We agreed that was ok with us, but also said we felt strongly the family with whom Neighbor lives should have input.

That brings us up to date and, to be honest, I am torn. I HATE what this man did. I hate that it has happened before, and I never want it to happen again. With that said, at first I was unsure as to whether or not Neighbor even knew what he did. He clearly has some emotional/intellectual challenges. But he also knew, at least to some extent, what he was doing‚Ä¶. As he admitted the act to the arresting detective. I get the feeling he is something akin to a deaf/mute Lennie from Of Mice & Men, and that tears my heart out. I don't think he really understands, and I don't want to be vindictive to someone like that. At the same time, he touched my son. If there were no clear impairment, I would want to take a baseball bat to his head. But there is, and instead I just feel like shit for everyone involved. This sucks, full stop.

On a more selfish note, the Megan's law registry. There are a handful of homes for sale in the area. Until now, my wife and I were hopeful that more families with children would move into the area. That hope is now over. Because Neighbor's history all predates Mega's Law, he was not on the registry. Now he will be, and no families with kids will move into the area. I realize this is tangential to the main topic, and pretty self-centered, but it's just one more way that Neighbor is going to make our lives a smidge worse, just by existing. To repeat myself, this sucks, full stop.

Sorry for the book, and if the Mods see fit to remove the update‚Ä¶ as it's not all that particular to legal matters, I understand. Honestly, I just feel a bit better getting it all down and putting it out there.

Thanks to anyone who reads through.",legaladvice
TIFU by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter,"This just happened last week. I got home from working out of town Thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. ""Beth"" comes in and I can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. She feels fine though. 

I am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. It is more than half closed and a little red. She still feels fine. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in.  

We get there and I go to check in. The receptionist that I have never seen looks at my daughter and says ""Oh. My goodness, what happened?""  So I respond as a joke ""Eh, she got out of line"".   

I know!  It's horrible. I'm sorry!  I have a weird sense of humor and I'm a bit socially awkward.  Anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  Soon we are called in. The checkup goes as expected. It's a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl.  Then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

He comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. The doctor is angry. We all head to the Doctor's office to talk.  

There is a policeman and a policewoman. The policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. My daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  So she says no and buries her face in my side.  The police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. I saw one of Beth's cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. The doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so Beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

The police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  I now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  She makes an excuse and leaves the room. He says that he thinks he has to let her go. He says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. He says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

The police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station.  A friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

We get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my Uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   The police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. They say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  I call my wife who goes ballistic.  

The county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. My uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don't need to make for this week.  I can't wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but I'm pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  Made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. Sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.

Thank you for the gold kind strangers.
Wow this blew up.  I wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  I want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  For those of you saying that I am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) I will not be sleeping on the couch.  My wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  At least not at me.

2) I am heading home from Boston tomorrow evening and I think everything should be resolved by then.

3) I will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  She was very young did not do this out of animosity. I do not know what if anything will happen to her job. I am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) The other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  A few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  These lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  The receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   The DEP closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  It turned out to be nothing.",tifu

Found out husband is the one stealing shallots from neighborhood gardens,"This has been going on for several years. I live in a small rural neighborhood with an HOA where the houses are spread apart but neighbors are expected to keep their houses and yards nice. As with most HOAs, some members can get a little carried away with the seriousness of it all. There will be passive aggressive emails about escaped dogs, shirtless runners, unsightly fencing, etc. It really annoys my husband. I just laugh at it

Well, a few years ago the neighbors got together and made a community garden in the center lot. There were a lot of emails sent about this. A lot of drama. I don't remember all of it but people would get upset if someone took up too much space with their plants, planted something unsightly, etc

So then we start getting emails complaining that someone was picking all the shallots/onions out of the garden. Some people thought it could be deer eating them. There were several theories. The next year the same thing happened and then people were also complaining that the onions/shallots were going missing from their personal gardens. This year it started happening again and people flipped out. All caps emails, demands to interrogate teenage residents, requests to put security cameras in the communal garden. Two houses were hit and then people started staking out in their gardens and putting up game cameras

It started out being funny because I'm not involved with gardening so it was just amusing to read all the emails. But this year people are getting really upset and wanting to get law enforcement involved. 

So anyway, you already know what happens. I walk down to the bottom of our property that I don't visit often and I find a lot of smashed onions and shallots. Like absolutely smashed to bits it clearly took a lot of work

I went inside and told my husband jokingly ""I think we're being framed for the onion heist!"" He got this really weird look on his face and I had the realization and asked him if he didn't have anything to do with this

He confessed to me that he did and had been stealing the onions and shallots to spite the neighbors. He was sneaking out at night to do this. I asked him why and he said he just hates them so much. 

I don't even know. This makes me really uncomfortable. The man is 31 and sneaking out at night to steal onions and I didn't even notice? Why wouldn't he just tell me? Like this has been going on for three years it's not like he just did it once as a prank

I don't know what to do. Can anyone help me think this through. Maybe I'm overreacting but I'm pretty upset

AITA for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?,"Hi all. 

I gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter Charlotte. 

My cousin Alice and her parents were among the guests. The first thing I'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. She's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. She doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. She is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

It was Alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly Charlotte vomited on her. Alice handed Charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. I went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. My mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

Today I got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (Alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly ¬£1800) since it was completely ruined. 

I have said no. At the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. She took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. I feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

WIBTA if I tell my bio daughter that I don't want to help her or have her in my life because she decided that her stepmom should adopt her once she turned 18?,"My ex husband and I divorced when my daughter was only 5yo. It was a messy divorce which ended in him getting primary custoy. I could have her every other weekend. Our marriage hit the rocks after the death of my twin sister. Depression hit me hard and I became an alcoholic. I willingly gave him primary custody so that she could have a better life. From then on, I strived to improve my life. I did AA, went to rehab and I've been sober for a long time now. By the time my daughter was 9, I was completely sober. I looked forward to our visits. I was really heartbroken that I didn't get much time with her. 

He remarried and I was really happy that she had a good family to take care of her. But over the years, her stepmom completely replaced me. She called her mom( I don't resent it, but it definitely stung ). She completely took my place at her school events, and after a while, my daughter didn't even inform me about anything in her life. I could clearly tell that she was no longer eager to visit me. I was not financially strong and could not afford all the things that her stepmom could afford for her.

At her graduation, she introduced her as her mother to other parents and I only got one picture with her. I was crushed. And when she turned 18, she asked her stepmom to adopt her. That broke my heart. She did not contact me much after that.

I moved to a different state after that. Moved on with my life and I met an amazing man who is now my husband. We have a daughter together. I've completely moved on and I don't resent anyone. I have a great job, a loving husband and an adorable daughter. I'm content. I don't regret or resent anything. 

Recently, my bio daughter contacted me and wanted to meet up wuth me. She's 28 now. According to her, she was kicked out of her house after my husband divorced her mother. She fell into depression, did drugs, skipped college and she's jobless. She's pregnant now and she wants me to help her. She apologized to me because she hurt me at that time. According to her, her mother manipulated her. 

Idk. I don't feel any connection between us now. Honestly, I've moved on and that chapter of my life is closed now. I don't want to open that wound ever. I don't think it will do any good for my mental health and I'm scared of the impact it might have on my young daughter. I don't think I can or should have her back in my life. WIBTA here??

Edit: I've talked to my ex and he told me that the step mom was a gold digger and cheated on him. But my daughter dropped out of college on her own because of her depression and started doing drugs. He tried to help her out but she never improved. So he finally kicked her out an year ago and never contacted her again. He adviced me not to take her in. He doesn't know that she's pregnant.

Edit2: I'm helping her find a place to stay and a sponsor for support group. I'm not letting her stay with me for now. I have explained to her that if she's not sober she will lose the custody of the baby and she told me that she'll do her best. Thanks for all the replies.

TIFU Deepthroating my boyfriend after eating chocolate ice cream on Valentine's Day,"As one might think on Valentine's Day in particular, people like to get up to some frisky business, myself included. After indulging in some post-dinner beer and chocolate ice cream, my boyfriend and I (F) decided to have an ""oral sex party"".  We felt creative and made up a card game that allowed us to test the luck of the draw. ~Card game rules at the bottom~
Each number card drawn would result in that amount of minutes of oral play performed on the partner, and if a face card was drawn, additional special features could be implemented during that turn, such as toys or fingers. Each turn consisted of drawing a card and pleasuring the other orally until the timer was up. Then switch and repeat until we couldn't take it anymore and would inevitably fuck. Pretty straight forward.

A few turns in, I had only drawn low numbers and was itching to give him longer blowjobs as he was drawing high cards and face cards. I had just drawn a 4 which followed his 8 minute King turn, so I was incredibly turned on and really just wanted to pleasure him as he deserved. I was having the time of my life, and he clearly was too, so I went off script and ignored the 4 minute timer. I kept going deeper and deeper until I was feeling him down my throat. Turned on by my own accomplishments of getting him that far back, I kept deepthroating him and when he told me he was going to cum, in my own enthusiastic dick swallowing vigor, I accidentally jammed him back to the feeling I knew there was no return from. A volcanic surge immediately erupted and I tried my darndest to swallow it back but there was just too much. I pulled back and tried, to catch it in my hands but was unsuccessful and left staring at a brown mess of the ice cream and cum on my white sheets.

Luckily my boyfriend is the sweetest ever and after a quick pic\*, cleanup, and laundry cycle, we cuddled and enjoyed the rest of the night together.

\--&gt;After it happened I realized I could reap the sweet karma benefits of my misfortune and decided it was best to gather photo proof of such event. Also was drunk and thought it was a good/funny memory to capture. Albeit disgusting...

Because y'all nasty asses wanted to see the [aftermath](https://imgur.com/a/ggWdsSr). It looks like shit so don't say I didn't warn you.


I guess it's inevitable with stories like these that end up blowing up to assume it's made up. Here is the [text](https://imgur.com/a/nqMulPq) I sent my bf asking for his approval to post because it doesn't just involve me, so I wanted to make sure he was comfortable with my sharing first. 3 years together and we continue to work on our communication and keeping each other in the loop. 

CARD GAME RULES-
Shuffle the desk of cards, either use half or full deck. However you're feeling in the moment. Each player draws a card to flip over simultaneously. Highest card is the giver in the first turn.

Alternate drawing cards and going down on each other for the number of minutes you draw on your card. If you draw a face card, these were the special rules. To be changed as is fit for your relationship. Ours were as follows-

Jack was either only hands or only mouth for that turn. Queen was the option to add a toy-vibrator for me, plug for him. King was the classic pinky in ass, other fingers in my pussy. Or for him, my finger in his ass, a recent addition to our sexual escapades which I love. Ace was getting to fuck, then going back to oral after that turn.

Each face card that was drawn was followed by the drawing of a number to figure out how long that would last.

Our rule was no cumming during the game so we could edge as long as possible before the inevitable fuck. That didn't end up happening past a few rounds...clearly.

Thank you for gold x4, kind strangers! Platinum too! And silver x4! I know many didn't think this was worthy of the gildings, so many thanks. Will be passing on the wealth in honor of this blunder.

"[WA] My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, who has previously never cared about her, is getting full custody and has told me he won't allow me to visit. Is there anything I can do?","Hi, so my life is falling apart.

As the title says, a few weeks ago my father and my step mother were killed in a car accident. They have been married for 7 years, and my step mother had a daughter from a previous marriage who is 8 years old. I love her unconditionally as if she were my own sister and I would fight tooth and nail to keep her safe.

She has no immediate family other than her father in the area, so he is going to receive full custody of her. I don't know if subjective opinions are allowed in posts like this, but this guy is a fucking asshole. The reason my step mother left him is because he was abusive (which was never reported to the police, but I know several people who have witnessed it first hand, so it absolutely 100% happened), and the reason he was abusive was because my step sister was born and he didn't want a child. As a result, he has never given a shit about her, never asked to see her, and has never wanted anything to do with her until now.

I was at home with my step sister a few days ago and he knocked on the door. I opened it and we had a really ugly conversation about what was going to happen to my step sister now that her mother and my father were dead. I told him that if he did end up having custody I would want to be seeing her as often as possible as I consider her my family. He told me, verbatim ""that's not gonna happen, son. I don't want my daughter spending time with half caste blood."" (he's referring to the fact that my father is mixed race, and that I am too as a result. I slammed the door. I was absolutely livid, which brings me to this post.

So basically, I have a few questions:First, Can anything be done to stop him having custody? There are no police reports about his abuse, and his criminal record is clean by all the research I have completed.

Third, at the very least, could I contend in a court that I have visiting rights to her? I'm not actually related to her, so I'm not sure what the standing is there.

Third, if it's not possible to force allowed visits, is there anyway I can straight up adopt my step sister? I have an office job that pays well, so financial security wouldn't be a problem, I have an apartment of my own, and I would be 100% willing to be her full time guardian.

**EDIT: I want to make it absolutely clear that my sister does not want to live with her dad, and she says she wants to live with me.**

Thank you so so so much to anyone who responds to this. I'm at my wits end and I will do literally anything to keep my step sister close to me, and I don't care about the cost.",legaladvice
TIFU by taking my bird for a walk and accidentally looking like a pedophile,"My husband and I adopted my parent's parrot this spring after my dad passed away and my mom moved into assisted living. We got a backpack carrier for him last month so we can visit and my mom can still see him (the parrot, not my dad).

Since we have the backpack, we decided to take him for nature walks instead of always keeping him in the house. For now we're putting the backpack in a baby stroller so it's less of a jarring bumpy ride until he gets used to standing on a moving perch. It's got screen mesh on three sides so he can see out, but it's a little hard to see into his pack from more than a foot or two away. It just looks like we're pushing a stroller with a large backpack in it.

So yesterday we went on our first walk in a local park. The bird's quiet, or calmly chirping, or occasionally saying ""Hello, youuuuuuu"" and we respond back in kind, a call and response thing he likes.

The park's mostly deserted - until the local high school track team runs by for their after-school practice run through the park. A bunch of teenage boys, shirtless. And one lags behind. As the lone boy, maybe 15 years old, runs past us, the bird calls out the loudest wolf whistle ever. And my husband and I burst out laughing, as the boy runs away from us faster.

Yesterday I went for a walk in the woods at Dodge Park when members of what I believe were your track team went running by me. One of the team members was lagging behind, and I inappropriately chose that moment to let out the loudest wolf whistle possible.

At the time I was sitting in my backpack carrier in a stroller, being pushed by my owners. They broke out in loud laughter. The person I whistled at probably didn't see me and thought my owners whistled at me to sexually harass me, and then were laughing loudly about it because they were jerks. That's not what happened, and while they didn't need to laugh, the whole incident was entirely my fault. I was acting inappropriately.

Sincerely,

Bongo, a poorly behaved parrot who needs to learn boundaries.

AITA for not giving the source of my beaded earrings to a white woman?,"I was born on a Res and lived there for most of my life until going to college in a nearby state. In my community, we have a number of talented women who are amazing at beading. They make some truly remarkable stuff. Caveat is that they will only sell or trade to other people from the community, and possibly another tribal group. It's just how they do it. 

I have 30 or so pairs of all kinds and wear them with pride. Almost every day I wear a brick stitch earring of some kind, it's just part of who I am, where I'm from, etc. Brings me a lot of joy.

Anyway a woman at work has really fallen in love with them. She compliments them and examines them. No issue there. Lots of people do. One day recently though, she asked me where I got them and if the person has an ""Etsy"" shop or something where she can buy her own. This woman is white with not a drop of the heritage in her, by her own admission. 

Now... personally I have no issue with white people wearing the earrings! It's not about that. Wear whatever you want. But the women in my community do not sell them to outsiders (again, for the most part). It's just not done. 

I told her no, and she asked for the contact information so she could commission a pair. I told her no again, that the person who makes them is very particular about who she makes them for. She kept pressing me, telling me ""Well let her make that decision!"" and stuff like that. 

I got tired of this and told her, point blank, this person will not create or sell anything for you because you are white. She got extremely upset and threatened to make a statement to HR about me being racially discriminating.

AITA? 

My reasoning is that if she wants beaded earrings, she can learn to make them herself, she can buy them from anyone else (there are so many white women on etsy who make ""boho style"" earrings), etc. She is merely upset because this one person will not cater to her.",AmItheAsshole
My sister is in some weird cult - MI,"No, that is not clickbait and I am seriously very worried about her and all of the other people involved.

Okay. So my sister graduated from high school last year and decided to take a gap year. She came across a Craigslist posting by a woman I'll refer to as Aileen about how she has a farm and she's looking for kids who want life experience, that she'll provide them room and board to work on her farm and how she can teach them all of these great skills. I never saw the ad, but I remember my sister telling me about it at the time. She was very excited, this opportunity was everything she had been looking for she had told me. So she began a correspondence with ""Aileen"". I did not live with my sister, I'm older by 5 years so I was not on the scene when all of this was going down. 

So she ends up going to this place last August, I think, maybe early September. I have only spoken with her through emails since and at first she was happy, everything was good, she was making friends and all of that. I was wondering why she only emailed and she told me there's no phone service on the ranch, ""Aileen"" doesn't believe in phones and she takes them to the library for internet access. That right there was the first time I thought something was a bit off, but my sister was happy so I didn't push it.

Over time, the tone of her emails changed. She would talk about her friends there, the animals, all these activities she was doing, not about ""Aileen"" much. Then it gradually became that ""Aileen"" is all she would talk about. ""Aileen"" was telling her some seriously messed up stuff and if she didn't agree with it, everyone else would ignore her existence until she broke down crying and apologized. ""Aileen"" made her slaughter her favorite chicken, ""Aileen"" said she needed to cleanse herself and wouldn't let her eat solid food for a week. ""Aileen"" made her take drugs. Seriously disturbing stuff. I told her she needed to get out of there, that I'd come pick her up, but she would downplay everything, make excuses for ""Aileen"", say she was over reacting, that it wasn't as bad as she made it seem et cetera. 

I didn't know what to do at that point. I thought something hinky was going on, but at the same time my sister was an adult and I trusted her judgment at the time. It's not like I had anything to go off of, a location, or anything and while disturbing, I didn't think anything super egregious was happening. ""Aileen"" seemed like an eccentric survivalist type, but ultimately harmless. Yes, I was tentatively concerned, is what I'm trying to say, but I felt like my sister was mature and intelligent enough to know when she was in over her head.

My sister emailed me yesterday and I don't feel like that is the case anymore. Something had happened and from what I was able to ascertain, one of the other girls at this place committed some kind of cardinal sin and ""Aileen"" instructed the other kids to beat viciously beat this girl. My sister was forced to participate in this. She seemed distraught about it, but ultimately blamed the girl because she should have known better than to have done what she did. I don't know what she did, my sister wouldn't elaborate on it. 

I stayed up all night pouring over all of her emails, lookings for some clue but I couldn't figure anything out. I know my sister took a Greyhound to Lansing and Aileen picked her up from the bus station, so I think this freak show is probably in either Eaton, or Ingham but as to more specifics, I have no idea. I don't think my sister even knows. I have a hunch they're in, or around Mason because Aileen made the kids spend the night at Seven Gables, but other than that I'm coming up empty.

I know this is a jumbled fucking mess, but I really need to know what to do. How do I handle this situation?

"TIFU By having, what is hopefully, the strangest sexual experience I encounter. NSFW","Literally happened a half hour ago.

Husband and I have been together 15 years.  We are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven't done and we love it all.  Nothing is gross or weird with us when we're getting off.

He asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  I did.  Unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  It was about the size of a quarter but he's tough and didn't complain.

I walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  He's not home 90% of the year because of work so I, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  I thought ""I'll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls"".  

He's loving it.  I'm loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.

I feel something as I'm making circles with my tongue.  No big deal whether it's hair or lint whatever so I quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  As I pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) I glance at it.  It's grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  It took a half a second to realize that I had literally sucked the scab off my husband's balls.

"My [28M] parents [60s M/F] are about to meet my girlfriend [26F] and they're going to weird about her weight, what do I do?","I have found what could very likely be the girl of my dreams. 

I could accurately use any cliche in the book to describe this woman. My world went from black and white to color when I met her, she knows me better than I know myself, and I feel complete for the first time. 

We've been dating for two years. We're planning to move in together. 

She's never met my parents, and it's starting to become obvious that I'm putting it off. 

I keep putting it off, because I know my parents won't like her. 

My parents have very antiquated views about what a woman should be and one of those things is thin. My girlfriend has an eating disorder, she is 5'2 and roughly 200 pounds. 

My family thinks if a woman is overweight it means she's infertile, self centered (doesn't care if her man finds her attractive), inactive, poor impulse control, and not a contributing member of society, I could go on and on. 

First of all, my girlfriend has been an athlete her whole life and competed at a national level all through college. She went to an Ivy League school, graduated with Latin Honors, and is the youngest person to ever have the job she has where she works. 

She's unfucking believable. 

She's so used to being the best and succeeding at things that her weight is a major sticking point for her and something she is very sensitive about. 

I don't know how to handle it with my parents if they make a comment (they did it to my brother's old girlfriend, no reason to believe it won't happen again) or if they're just generally hostile. 

I've told her my parents are from a different time and place and are very sexist and whether or not they like her will have no bearing on how I view her but I still don't know how to handle this. 

My girlfriend really wants my family to like her since we're going to move in together and I don't know what to do about this. 

Usually we talk things out very directly but her eating disorder stems from a traumatic period in her life so discussing it has to be handled carefully and I'm not sure how to basically say ""my parents are kind of morally bankrupt in some ways"" without ruining any chance of a relationship between the three of them. 

Should I call my parents beforehand and tell them if they plan to be rude they'll just never meet her? Or tell my girlfriend if something happens she has my blessing to say ""go fuck yourself"" and walk out? Or something else entirely? I'm freaking out about this. 

*tl;dr: My girlfriend is overweight, I don't care at all, she wears it well and is a perfect 10. I've been putting off introducing her to my parents because I know they'll make a huge deal out of it and embarrass her. We're moving in together and I can't put off introducing them. How do I head this off?*

"AITA for grounding my daughter because she called my SIL a ""slut""?","My daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. A boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. I believe he sent a video to her as well. Before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. It appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. I notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200B;

My husband and I are respectful and non-judgmental of my SIL's profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. My daughter is understandably upset and I feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. She unfriended my SIL from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. She refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my SIL house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. I tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200B;

My SIL is hurt from all of this. Not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. Last weekend, I went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. My daughter refused and referred my SIL as ""a vapid slut"" and her husband ""a pathetic cuck"" along with other slurs I don't want to repeat.

&#x200B;

I grounded her for three months and took away her internet. My husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that's too much. He also admitted he struggled accepting his sister's career path at first. He thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Seems like my husband is right and I went too far with the punishment. I just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. I'm going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. Will decide with the husband later. We're definitely concerned for our daughter about what's happening at school and we're looking into therapy.

For clarification, as for my SIL's privacy, she didn't consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",AmItheAsshole

My mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600V. The doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. It put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.,"Location: US. Original incident happened in Indiana.

I should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point I doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

When I was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. She thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. This led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. It turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

It could be some form of PTSD I suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. She told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

My(24F) coworker(50F) blamed me for my miscarriage (UPDATE),"It's been a long day. First, I want to again thank everyone for their love, support, and advice. I wasn't able to answer everyone but know I tried to read all of them. Thank you.


So, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. Now, yesterday I was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. She did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


Co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. She saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming I wasn't working. What she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'I still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him I wasn't on the application and I wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


My boss calmly assured her that I was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (I get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong I guess, doubled down and was upset I hadn't communicated that to her. I didn't even know. My boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and I guess they talked in circles for a bit. He let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. She had nothing. 


When I spoke to my boss, at this point I was upset. I finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. He was not pleased. He did let me know I don't have to explain myself and that next time if I'm in that situation to go straight to him. He offered his condolences for my loss.


As for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. Anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. Though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. She has a laundry list of people to ask before me. He told me to document everything. Anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


Today, she hasn't been around me. She even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. She hasn't said a word all day. It's been a wave of relief for me.


TLDR: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. She is now not allowed to speak to me.

"TIFU by going to the Eiffel Tower & getting my girlfriend and I tear-gassed, trampled, assaulted, and robbed","^Obligatory: ^This ^didn't ^happen ^today, ^but ^over ^the ^summer. ^also ^warning ^some ^NSFW ^language.

^TL;DR ^first ^because ^it's ^long: ^Went ^to ^Eiffel ^Tower ^to ^watch ^Euro ^2016 ^finals, ^ended ^up ^in ^a ^[riot](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/euro-2016-french-riot-police-fire-tear-gas-at-supporters-outside-paris-fan-zone-during-france-match-a7129906.html) ^because ^we ^ran ^late, ^got ^tear ^gassed, ^girlfriend ^dislocated ^knee, ^her ^phone ^stolen, ^my ^nose ^broken, ^and ^our ^passports ^stolen.

**BACKGROUND:** My girlfriend (who we'll call Emily) and I were in Paris on the very first day of a month long backpacking trip in Europe. We spent the whole morning smoking hash at Sacr√©-Coeur with some new friends, who told us that the Euro 2016 final between France and Portugal was that night. They told us to meet them to watch the game at the 'fan zone' at the Eiffel Tower but urged us *not to be late,* otherwise we wouldn't get into the 'fan zone.' 

Being jet-lagged and burnt out from the hash, we took a nap before heading down, but overslept by an hour. We figured we'd head down to the Eiffel Tower anyway and see what was going on. whoops.

**THE FUCK UP:** Arriving at the Eiffel Tower we realize there isn't any fanzone to be found, or so we think. It turns out we are in the [completely wrong place](http://imgur.com/a/8PES8) on the opposite side of the tower from the fan zone, and amongst a crowd of mostly troublemakers that is about to erupt into a riot. 

The first signs of chaos are a small group of youths antagonizing police underneath the tower, and when we see a massive line of riot police facing in our general direction, we decide it's time to leave. 
As we make our way through the crowd I hear screaming and look up in horror to see a smoking projectile sailing through the sky, headed right for us. The crowd around us scatters, knocking Emily and I down, where a **tear gas canister blows up mere feet from our faces**. 

""Get up! We have to go!"" I'm screaming at Emily but I notice she's crying & screaming out in pain, not from the tear gas in our eyes but from the fact that **her knee is so broken the thing might as well be on Mars.** I throw her over my shoulder and go sprinting through clouds of tear gas out of the chaos and onto the Pont d'Iena bridge, where some guy **snatches Emily's phone out of her hand**. I turn and watch helplessly as the guy runs off into the crowd, Emily screaming ""he took my phone!"" 

""Fuck the phone!"" I run as far as my arms/legs allow and then set her down. I need to get her to an ambulance, but I can't leave her to find one, so I need someone to help me. So I start screaming at the crowd around me for someone to help, forgetting that I am amongst almost nothing but riff-raff of the worst variety. Nobody helps me or seems to give a shit, so I pick her up and run as far as I can and set her down again. A crowd gathers ogling my girlfriend's knee and staring at me blankly as I shout shit they don't understand like ""911! AMBULANCE!"" 

It's then I am disgusted to notice a hand reaching from Emily's purse to my back pocket, and I slap it away forcefully, standing up from a crouching position as I do so, screaming ""FUCK OUT OF HERE!"" I look into the eyes of the perpetrator, a young African guy who loads up and punches me in the face, **shattering my nose**. As blood spurts out of my nose I look at the guy and say with genuine bewilderment ""are you fucking kidding me?"" He looks at me blankly like he is genuinely surprised to see me still on my feet and spitting profanity at him. I scoop up my girlfriend and start running for our lives. 

I'm now running on what I am convinced is just an infinite bridge of hell on earth. Brawls rage around us as my knees are starting to buckle, my vision blurring. I'm bleeding out of my head onto my girlfriend's lap who is screaming in agony from being carried around with a dislocated knee. I am pretty sure we are going to die. 

Suddenly I'm joined by our savior, a very large goofy looking fellow, who begins helping me carry Emily and encouraging us in French or some other language which we didn't speak. It occurs to me that he could be trying to steal from us too, but at this point I don't even care.  Our new friend's intentions turn out to be true, as he and his group of friends helped me carry my girlfriend to relative safety and helped me guard her while they got help. (For a while I couldn't tell this part of the story without getting extremely emotional about this guy and his friends who stepped up to help us when everyone else was trying to take advantage of our situation. I'll never forget him.)

A bunch of paramedics pulled up in a station wagon, urging me to stay calm while they waited for an ambulance. As police pushed rioters further down the bridge in our direction, I begged the paramedics to just get us out of there in the car. With fear in their eyes and the situation escalating they finally relented, carefully placing Emily in the backseat while I jumped in the trunk.

They got us to a safe part of the city and asked us for our ID. It's then we realized that, as if we weren't having a bad day already, **our passports had been stolen.**

We ended up at a hospital outside Paris, where they did a great job re-setting my girlfriend's knee and didn't touch my nose which was fine with me. It's still crooked. Luckily we were able to get emergency passports and continue on the rest of our trip which was absolutely amazing. I still smell tear gas sometimes when I see  Eiffel Tower pictures & trinkets. Good times!

tl;dr (again): Was late to the Eiffel tower to watch Euro 2016 finals, ended up in a riot, got tear gassed, girlfriend's knee broken, her phone stolen, my nose broken, and our passports stolen.

**EDIT:** Since people are pointing out how I mentioned that the guy who punched me was African, which was for the sole purpose of illustrating the scene, I'd like to add that my entire day in Paris was spent hanging out with African guys who showed me more hospitality than I have found almost anywhere else in the world. I hung out with these guys that one day for like 6 hours, they talked to me a lot about just how poor and starving much of the African population in Paris is. I harbored a lot of anger towards the guy that punched me for a while but I also understand the context of just how starving that guy probably was. people that are trying to politicize this, or turn it into some racist/anti-refugee talking point, or are leaving comments like ""those thugs should burn in hell"" should have a more nuanced perception of the world.

EDIT2: if the Alt-right folks that are trying to make me their racist champion just because I called the guy African would fuck off, that would be great :)

So the general consensus was that I was being a raging asshole, though a few thought I was just ignorant. It's been a while since I made that post, and my own conclusion is that I am probably both.

I've done a LOT of thinking about my behavior that week and I've realized a lot of things. This isn't something that I wrote in my original post because it was off topic and sounded like I was just making excuses for myself, but my dad had passed away earlier that week and I had been in a terrible mood. I wasn't acting like myself at all. Instead of coping in a healthy way, I'd been looking to my girlfriend for a pick-me-up and unfairly blaming her when she failed to deliver (for a reason completely out of her control).

The date wasn't really for her, it was for ME, and that's what I'd been trying to avoid thinking about. I was behaving very selfishly and trying to convince myself that I was just upset because this problem had happened before. The truth was, her period getting in the way of dates had never really bothered me before this time around. I was just looking for reasons to justify my own anger.

That was extremely immature of me, to say the least.

I apologized to my girlfriend and, because she's an angel, she accepted the apology. Because of the comments suggesting she may have a medical problem I asked her if she had PCOS or endometris, and surprisingly enough, she said that she had never been examined for either.

We went to have her examined and it turns out that she has PCOS, which essentially means she has cysts in her ovaries, which explains the irregular periods and extreme pain during them. So yeah, I felt horribly guilty about blaming her for that. Luckily she has not seen some of the other symptoms of it (weight gain and hair growth) but she is pretty worried that they will appear. She'll be getting regular treatment from now on so I'm hopeful that she will see some relief soon.

TLDR; I was being an ass because of my bad mood and it turns out my girlfriend has PCOS. Thankfully she forgave me and we are back to our normal, loving selves. Thanks for the help, Reddit.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by accidentally doing my black history month project on a white guy,"In 5th grade, I had a black history month project where I had to make a presentation on a person of my choice. I looked up 'important African Americans' and found a Wikipedia page with a list of famous black people, or so I thought. I chose Allan McLeod Cormack, a South-African American scientist, seeing that he invented the CT scan. I put my blood sweat and tears into that project. Two days before the project was due I decided to put a picture of Cormack on my poster. To my confusion, all I could find was a picture of this white guy. Turns out, he was a white South African. I made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. She let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but I had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month. 

TL;DR I did my black history project on a white guy and didn't realize until the day before it was due, resulting in me having to redo my work.

I(22M) Recently discovered My Dad (50M) choose me over my former Stepmother and Half-sister(17F) 6 years ago. Don't know how to process this.,"I was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. Both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. When I was sent to live with my dad, I was broken. I barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  I wasn't mad or angry. I was null of any kind of emotion. Basically I was alive but wasn't living. I kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. I was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. I was more social with my dad but I kept it to a bare minimum.  I had noting left to say to anyone. It took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. That's how withdrawn I had become.

Dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  When I experienced night- terrors, I would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  He drove me to all of my therapist appointments. He made sure I was eating properly. There were days, I would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. He literally went above and beyond for me. I hated the city that were living in. Because  I had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

I was so passive, it was scary. My therapist had told my dad that I was stuck in the victim's cycle; I didn't know how to get out. Because of this, I was bullied quite a bit. By the time I was 15, I had been to 3 different schools. It got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. I was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. Noting would motivate me.

Looking back, Dad did spoil me but at the time I wasn't aware of it. I was so in my own body that I barley acknowledged my surroundings.   If I asked my dad for a new bed spread, I would get me new one plus new furniture. My phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. I was grateful and thanked him. I did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. Again I was being polite. I didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. I barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

By the time I was 16, Dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. I didn't question it. He had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. I didn't think it was any of my business so I didn't press the issue. A year later, Dad had divorced my stepmother. One of Dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in Boston and he took it. We moved and I felt I was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. That year was probably the best year of my life. I was coming out of my shell. There was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. It was if I was like everyone else. I felt ""normal"". I became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, I was going out more. Us moving probably saved my life.

Because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. There was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. You could just sense it. It got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

Me and Dad have always been close. When I had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, I could see my dad crying in the crowd. I lived with my dad while I attended college ( I still do for the time being) . Ever since I was child, I always wanted to be a doctor. Well, I just finished my first year of medical school. Honestly, I feel like a normal young adult in society. I have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom I've been with for 4 years. I'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

Recently, I got FB message from my half-sister. She was apologizing a lot and I had no clue what she was talking about. Turns out, the reason why Dad and I moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what I was watching her change........... Yes. She told her mom that I was watching her change.. At the time, I was traumatized of sex. Heck I was terrified of any form of intimacy. The kid was envious of what Dad was doing for me. She was so envious that she tried to move me out. Well I guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and I'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. Because we moved out, I think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. How can someone be so cruel? What did I ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. I didn't even respond. More importantly, Dad never let this to get back to me. Chances are if I had heard about this when I was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. It also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

This is a lot to take in and I have a new found of respect and love for my dad. He gave up this marriage for me so I could live a normal life.Dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. I'm missing him a lot lately.

Should I bring it up to him when he returns? Also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? At the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and I almost want to help.

Tl;dr: Dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. Dad kept it from me for 6 years. Should I bring up with him?

Edit: I wasn't expecting such a huge response. I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. It will take some time but I will read all of them or as much as I can. As I was going through the comments, I found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. This a part of my life. I don't normally like to talk about about this . Aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. The fact the people are saying that it's fake.... I don't what to say. It's not my place to try and convince anyone. Believe  me, they're times I wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. When I wrote this, I wasn't thinking about syntax. It was more just getting this out. People questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. Forgive me but I wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

As for how I became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; I did respond to it in the comments but I'll post it here too. 

""It was very unorthodox how I became valedictorian after attending a real HS for only a year. My overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because I was in online classes for my previous hears, I wasn't eligible at the time. I met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

I broke down in front of the coordinator and I told her the truth. Being named valedictorian was something I always wanted. To be that would have been my first accomplishment that I would have achieved based on my own merit. Yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. It wasn't trying to be Valedictorian financial reasons. Money wasn't a problem (Dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. This would have helped me self-worth as well.

The girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and I told her the truth. She actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. It something I'll forever be grateful for. That's actually how me and her became friends."". Not many people would do that and in HS. 

I'll be posting again. I just need a few days.",relationship_advice
WIBTA for not allowing meat to be served at my wedding?,"I'm a gen 1.5 Indian migrant to the UK (was born in India but moved when I was 6 with parents) so while I grew up British and consider myself to be British, I still have family in India and my Indian heritage is an important part of my identity. My wife is 4th gen Indian - her family immigrated decades ago so she, and her parents grew up fully anglicised. I'd like to stress there's nothing wrong with that - why should she have ties to a country her grandparents were born in?

Due to the difference in culture we are having two weddings - one in England for all her family and our friends, and one in India for the rest of my family and friends there. We had the first wedding, which was very traditional and western  - church, reception etc. It was great, and we had fun. Now the wedding in India - it's important as my grandparents are too old to fly to the UK so I'd love for them to see me get married. 

The problem comes with the menu - in a Hindu wedding, and especially in the south, you don't serve meat. You just don't. In fact, what's served at a wedding is something called a [sadya](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadhya). It's fully vegetarian, and served on a banana leaf - super traditional. My wife says we should allow meat, despite the cultural taboo - saying her side of the family 'won't be able to cope' without meat. I'm of the opinion that they're all adults, and they can live with the inconvenience - hell, if it's that bad run to a KFC after the ceremony and gorge yourself - but at the wedding itself, no meat. It's also not like there won't be any meat - there'll be non veg food at the Sangeet, there'll be meat at the reception. 

Also during the English wedding I sided with her over my parents over the serving of beef - my parents, being Hindus don't partake, but I told them they should just eat something else, not ask that beef not be served entirely. 

So, WIBTA for not wanting meat at the wedding?",AmItheAsshole

WIBTA if I report the nurse practitioner at urgent care to HR for basically slut shaming me?,"I've \[F21\] recently encountered a new sexual partner. We used a condom, but after words I felt a little uneasy as to this was the first time I have ever hooked up with someone I just met. My previous sexual partners have all been someone I have developed deep connections with in some kind of way. While condoms greatly reduce the chance of contracting a STI, it cannot provide ABSOLUTE protection. A few days ago, I noticed my discharge changed to a white substance that's different from my normal discharge and the first thing that came to my head was an STD. I have never had one before and I have no idea the symptoms, but an STD was all I could think about. 


I went to an urgent care because I wanted to see if there was maybe a simpler answer to this problem  (yeast infection or UTI) and if not, I wanted to send my urine off for an STD screening.  My doctor asked me a series of questions (when did you become sexually active, when was your last sexual partner, how many sexual partners, etc.) , all of which I was up front and honest about so she could better treat me. 


It came time for her to make a diagnosis and tell me the best course of action. She says based on my symptoms, I am showing hallmark signs of a yeast infection, but she will send my urine off for a culture and STD screen along with a swob from my vagina so she can tell what type of yeast is growing down there. 


As I'm about to get my keys and stand up to walk out, she says ""Dear, will you sit down for just another moment."" I sat back down and looked up at her, curious as to what she wanted to talk about. ""With all of that being said, you're 21 years old, you really need to guard and protect your character,"". I looked at her like ""what the fuck"" and she continued ""well you know, guys get to have sex all they want and nothing bad comes out of it for them but you know us as women we can't be doing that as much because we have to protect our character,"". At this point, I was pretty fucking angry. You could tell by my silence and the way my lips were pressed together. I thought that maybe it couldn't get any worse, then she proceeded to say ""you're going to want to have kids one day, and the way you're living your life now could really hurt you and your chances of having a kid with a good man,"".

I was open and honest with this woman in hopes that it would help her better treat me and in turn I get slut shamed for it? I posted this in a forum about sexual education and I was getting advice to report her to HR. I don't want to go after anybody's job, but I don't want other women to have to go through this same thing just for having sex. 

Will I be the asshole if I report her to HR or should I leave it alone?

Edit: For everybody asking, I was literally in too much shock to say anything to her at the moment. I just kind of stared at her because I immediately felt embarrassed and regretted the information I shared with her so openly. So after a couple of seconds she said ""I appreciate your openness and honesty tho"" (like that mattered after anything she just said üò©) and opened the door for me to leave so I just said ""thanks"" and left. I was too embarrassed and in too much shock to say anything in the moment. Trust me, I wish I would have but I wasn't even thinking about going off on her. I was just embarrassed. 

Also, she was a nurse practitioner. I know a couple of times I referred to her as a doctor, but her official title was NP. 

And for everyone slut shaming me even further: sorry ur insecure that I'm having more fun than u üòò


UPDATE

Before I start off with the update, I want to address some of the negative comments in the original post. 

1) I am not heartless, and in the original post I even directly said I did not want to go for her job. That was never my intention and I even explicitly said that. 

2) for ever man calling me a slut: you're obviously insecure in the idea that women can have sex for pleasure, just as you can. I also explained how this was my first time ever hooking up with somebody I just met, so ""closing my legs"" or ""quit being easy"" doesn't fucking apply. In Game if Thrones, every single ""whore"" had one thing in common and that's that they enjoyed sex. So if enjoying sex and using it for pleasure makes me a whore, then sign me the fuck up! 

3) For teenage girls/young girls sexually active: if you come across this post, just know that it is very unprofessional for health care providers to pass judgment on your sexual life. What you decide to do with your body is really nobody's business despite what other people are saying on this thread. 

Now to the update: 
I called the urgent care and asked to speak with either a patient advocate or NP supervisor. They didn't have a patient advocate and the doctor overseeing the NPs was out, so they let me talk to the manager of the clinic. 

First and foremost, I explained to the manager that I in no means wanted any disciplinary action taken. I did not want her to lose her job, but maybe be given a talk or PIP to improve her service and not use personal beliefs or judgment when taking care of patients. 

I explained to her everything that happened and before I could even say who the NP was, she knew EXACTLY who I was talking about...which confirmed that she's most likely been this way towards other patients previously. 

I then explained how I confided in her and that I came into the office for medical advice and not personal judgment and her using my openness to pass judgment has made me weary about being open with doctors in the future. I explained that her words didn't hurt me, just my future interactions with health care providers AND future interactions with her other women patients. 

The lady was very nice, and once my complaint was heard she said she'd ""call the doctor (her supervisor)"" right away and to expect a call from him on my cell. She also said she was placing a note and that the NP wouldn't be back in the office until next Monday. 

With all of that being said, thank you to everyone for your advice! You've truly been so helpful.

AITA for refusing to allow my daughter to participate in High School cheerleading?,"I have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  Both of them have always been bookworms.  Very studious and cerebral, just like their Dad.  I also played sports all through school and I value the experience that brings.  I've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  I tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  We dont know til we try?  Even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   My wife insisted I back off.  Fair enough.  

&#x200B;

Now my daughter is entering High School and wants to become a cheerleader.  She has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  She actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  But one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  She's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in High School because she was ""a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.""

&#x200B;

I said no.  I dont appreciate that reasoning.  My wife explained that I dont ""know what its like to be a girl in high school"" and I say OK?  Hows that relevant?  I also dont appreciate cheerleading.  Its too dangerous.  Girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  We don't have the insurance to cover it.  Lastly, I dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  Those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  My wife says I'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  Most girls dont get injured.  I'm the pervert because I'm making it sexual.  I pushed for her to join a sport.  I let my son play sports.  She'll have a much better high school experience.

I was wrong.

So very very *very* wrong. There had to be hundreds of spider eyes reflecting back at me. I'm not sure how I made it back in the house but I was told screaming was involved. Now I'm terrified of leaving my house.

I've been at the house often helping out with the kids and doing whatever I can with them and I feel as if I am also sort of helping her in a way by not really letting them process that I am, in fact, not my brother.

I would like to thank u/Gavroche15 for his concise prediction of what had happened these past two weeks. You can read his thesis [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/96r4mc/fiance_wanted_an_open_marriage_so_i_called_off/e4ppclq).

Jokes aside, it has been an interesting two weeks since my initial post.

‚Äã

Monday last week I talked with a lawyer at work about the situation with the therapist. He looked at me like I was bullshitting him, and asked me if this was a prank. So I asked him if he wants to hear the recording. ""Damn right!"" was his answer. I talked again with him the next day, at the end of it.

He noted a few things I didn't pay attention to. On the recording, the therapist was always saying ""we think"", ""we want"", ""we talked about"", ""we decided"". Not once did she say ""Your Ex here asked me to talk with you"" or ""Your ex wants you to know"", or anything like that. It was always ""we this"", ""we that"".

He also asked me what my endgame is. Do I want to sue? He didn't think I personally have a case, to which I agreed. I never intended to sue anyway, but notify the appropriate institutions and let them deal with the therapist.

A decision was made to write two letters. One addressed to the clinic the therapist works at, and one for APA (we checked, she was accredited). By Wednesday there were a few more people at work aware of the situation, including one of the two case researchers. She dug up information about the therapist, online reviews, as well as the contacts for two of her previous patients. The therapist didn't have the best reviews, there were people upset with her, and we managed to track the two we talked with through social media. They were more than happy to help once we explained the situation, and their stories were not any better than mine.

The letters grew a consistent size, as we included the signed stories from the other two individuals, as well as my own description of how my ex changed once she started the therapy sessions, and a detailed description of how my meeting with the therapist went.

Friday last week I met with the parents. Her parents came to my parent's house, and we had the talk. My ex was there too, and more info was disclosed. That made its way to the report on the therapist as well.

This week, we sent the reports out. There was a reaction from the clinic. They called our office on Thursday morning, most probably to check if it is a prank or a real issue. We talked with their lawyer (or one of their lawyers) over the phone, and, when we confirmed it was legitimate, someone else was heard in the background, on their end, with a ""Well, crap!"" They said they are taking this very seriously. A conclusion from one of the guys at work was that they probably received other complaints before, but this is the first time someone did it so well documented. Their letter also mentioned we are reporting this to APA, that might have turned the heat on as well, hence their quick reaction.

I don't know what the result of this will be, and I consider my issue with it closed. However, having talked with the other two individuals that were ""treated"" by this therapist, I sincerely hope she is at least investigated, because she sounds insane and with an agenda (she ruined their relationships as well). One of the individuals was a woman, for the record.

‚Äã

Then, my ex and her parents.

‚Äã

Friday last week my parents called me and asked me to give them a visit after work. When I did, surprise! My ex and her parents were there too. My first reaction, seeing their cars in my parent's driveway, was to flee. This meeting was supposed to be on my terms, but she attempted to take the reigns to it. That was not going to happen, let me tell you.

My ex was waiting for me outside. She looked VERY good. If there was ever a girl you'd like your parents to meet, she was the image of it.

She told me ""they"" are here to talk with me, and see if we can fix this. ""They"" as in her parents. She either never told them what happened, or she gave them a version of a story they were not buying.

She had a journal with her. She told me she started writing in it before she began therapy, and continued writing in it until that Friday morning. That I should read it and it will clear out all this mess. I told her this is not a book club.

I wanted to go inside and get the circus going, but she asked me if I can give her ten minutes. She wants to talk with me for ten minutes before I talk with her parents. And she kept handing me her journal, and started crying. And then my sister showed up, and then my ex's sister showed up. They were already there, and came out to ""check on us"". So I took her journal, went inside, said hello, and lead my ex in the back of the garden, to an as isolated portion of my parent's garden as possible (they have a large garden with a lot of trees and benches).

She quit her job. The stress was too much, and she had a breakdown, it escalated, never got better. She is no longer seeing the therapist. She started seeing the therapist for work related matters, but somehow it turned into matters about our relationship, and it stayed focus on the relationship because it was the only thing the therapist seemed interested in. She never told her parents why she is my ex. She is seeing another therapist now.

I just listened.

She turned the discussion from ""her"" to ""us"". Told me I would be in control. I will be managing the finances. I will receive access to all her devices. I will be able to track everywhere she goes. Any property we will own will be in my name. She will do anything I want to trust her again. Basically things she said in her messages over the last weeks. She enumerated more things than the ones I mention. I don't know how she thinks that would be a healthy life, for either of us.

I asked her is she cheated. She told me she had the opportunity to cheat, but she had never. I believe her. But it also angered me. What does she mean ""she had the opportunity""? If you are in a committed relationship, you don't put yourself in a position where you have this opportunity. You don't want this opportunity. It's like saying ""I had the opportunity to kill someone today"". Why? What were you doing that there was such an opportunity. Why call it opportunity anyway, it makes it sound like something positive.

That pretty much ended our ten minutes, and told her we should go and talk with our parents.

So we did. I asked our sisters to leave us alone, as it was not any of their concern what was to be discussed. My sister huffed and puffed, but a house made of stone survives hurricanes - and she was not one.

Well, I talked, and explained what happened, how the therapy session went, and my resolve. I didn't mention I had a recording, because I never had to. My ex confirmed everything I said, which surprised me. Her father had teary eyes, and that broke my heart. Her mother asked her if this is how she thinks they raised her, and asked for an explanation.

My ex basically told them the same story. Stress at work. Depression. Breaking down. Therapy. Therapist wanting to talk only about our relationship. That the therapist told her our relationship was the root of all her stress. That the therapist convinced her I want an open relationship. That she might lose me if she doesn't level her sexual experience with me. How my reaction woke her up from her slump. She quit her job, is looking for something less stressful. She will do anything I want to get me back. Started crying.

My ex mentioned the journal again, and said if I read it, it will explain everything, and that she was not on board with the therapist's ideas, but she went along with them because the therapist was a person with authority and experience. Our parents looked at me and I told them someone's private journal is not the type of literature I read, unless they are a dead poet.

‚Äã

Big fucking mistake!

‚Äã

My intention was to relate that someone's private journals usually becomes literature if they are a famous writer, or leader, and usually they are published post mortem. Also, I was hoping they get the hint that I don't really want to read her journal, because it would be of no consequence. What was done was done. Everyone looked at me as if I wished death on my ex. You could smell the hostility in the air.

So I said ""fine, fine"" and ""promissed"" I will read her journal. You win some, you lose some, and then you use the wrong words and you lose a few more.

My ex is seeing a new therapist. She showed her parents emails confirming her appointments. He's an older dude, with a white beard like Freud. I searched him online, he is married, he attends conferences, he wrote a few books (they are on Amazon, ha!), seems like a solid character.

‚Äã

""Can you kids work this out?""

‚Äã

This was the second thing that angered me that day. As if this is child play, and we should just listen to the adults. We are not old enough to be in control of our own feeling, and we should definitely not be the ones to decide what we consider a betrayal you can't recover from. We are just ""kids"" and we should just work it out. So I won back some ground on the ""dead poets society"" remark earlier.

‚Äã

And this is how the day ended.

‚Äã

We've known each other for 9 years, and have been a couple for 5 years. Even if there are legitimate reasons behind her behavior, how do you go back to being the same? This wasn't even a reset. My way of thinking about my ex has been fundamentally changed. She became a stranger I know a lot of things about. Sure, I still find her attractive. VERY attractive, they way she looked last Friday was amazing. No denying that. But it was also calculated, I am not going to lie myself here. Hair done the way I like it, dress that I bought for her, the shoes I like the most, a hint of the perfume I gifted her, etc.

‚Äã

The journal...

...is on my nightstand. I haven't read it, and I probably never will. I did look through it, to see if it indeed is a year old, and it is. The way the pages folded, the ink is clearly older on the first pages, and you can see it progressing through the pages. The pen she used was attached to the journal, and I tested it, looks like the same ink. And the ink level in the pen is consistent with how much I assume the pen has been used for the last year to write the journal. It is not a fake. Everything about it is consistent with a year's worth of wear and tear.

‚Äã

I don't see what good reading it will make me. A tool to play with one's mind? Well, not rally, I don't think a year ago when she started writing it she intended to use it as manipulation. If what she told me is right, her new therapist suggested the idea to share the journal with myself.

‚Äã

As for how I am handling people that are too curious about why the wedding is off? ""We had a huge difference of opinion that we could not find a solution to."" More or less.

But if her sister finds out why, and this is more than likely, because her sister is very close to their mother, everyone will find out the real reason why.

‚Äã

Our parents want us to meet again next week. They told me to read the journal, and maybe that helps. Maybe we can work on it. Start again, fresh, since we have so much history. She will get treatment, she will get better, she still is the same woman I fell in love with, but she is not well right now. They can tell I still love her, or else I would not be so ""theatrical"", their words, not mine.

‚Äã

I don't think I will meet them next Friday.

‚Äã

But, damn! She did look amazing!

‚Äã

I would like to thank the community for the support and help. It was enough to help me put together a plan of action regarding the therapist. Thank you to those who provided resources and information about what to do.

(Final update) My (21F) boyfriend (22M) tried to gaslight me into getting plastic surgery.,"This is going to be the last post I make about this situation. I want to put the whole thing behind me and focus on moving forward now, but my last post got a lot of responses so I felt as though I needed to say at least something on the matter. 

A lot of you have been greatly helpful to me in this time and I appreciate that more than I can say. To those of you calling me an idiot or saying I was making excuses for him - I wasn't. Evidently I knew his actions were wrong, otherwise I wouldn't have made the post to begin with. I clarified that he was usually very nice to me because he was. He's helped me through panic attacks, paid for a lot of my food when I've had no money, defended me against a previous abuser, and always been very attentive prior to recent incidents. Of course I knew that his actions in my post were wrong, I was trying to stress that he is not normally like this & that he was not aggressive with me. This is a man that I felt safe with because he had given me all the reason in the world to feel safe with him. He protected me from a lot, and literally came to my aid at 3am once when I was alone and distraught on some random beach! Of course he had my complete trust.

Anyway.

Following my last post, I basically avoided him and confided in some of my rl friends about it. In doing so, one of them (lets call her Daisy) brought me to the realisation that I was never THAT insecure about my body, and that my boyfriend had simply been making me feel that way. It sort of feels like a weight has been lifted in that regard but the realisation made me so so so angry. I rarely get angry but talking to everyone and reading everything and learning more about gaslighting made me SO pissed. Then there was the icing on the cake - TWO of my friends confirmed that he did indeed go to Lucy's party (no shit) but Lucy hadn't actually wanted him there?? She's apparently very aware of his obsession with her and isn't entirely comfortable with it. Great! I guess I'm fucking blind.

That really was the final straw for me. So last night when I saw him, I asked him about the party again and whether he went to mine or Lucy's. Again, he said mine. I told him that I'm not an idiot and that our friends could all confirm his whereabouts. He seemed bothered that I had been talking to people about the situation and he started with the whole ""your jealousy is really getting bad"" shit and at that point I lost my temper. I told him that I wasn't jealous, I was just trying to understand why he was lying to me about something so dumb. It wasn't even a good lie. 

We had a pretty rough argument and I brought up his constant comments about surgery and as we argued, little things started dawning on me about other stuff he had previously done. I cried a lot. He kept trying to be calm but it didnt always work.

But yeah. I'll spare the gory details. I did try to break up with him but I don't think it sunk in. As far as I'm concerned we're over, but he doesn't seem to really get it yet. I'm sure he will soon. I've blocked him on everything and I'm going to keep my distance, but we have a lot of the same friends so fully cutting him out isn't going to be as easy as I would like. I'm done with this though. He dominated so much of my life and I'm still doubting myself so much about everything but i have a lot of good friends helping me. Apparently he was weird about Lucy even when he was with his ex, so I think I might talk to her about the situation. 

I wanna keep moving forward. I need to get past this fucking fog in my brain that he put there. When we met he told me he'd lost a sibling in a car crash, yet no one ever spoke about it and I thought that was strange. At the time I thought it was due to grief but now i think no one spoke about it because it didn't fucking happen. I had so much faith in this man and for a long long time he really was my best friend. I already miss him and it fucking sucks but frankly I've overcome worse.

I'll be fine.

Invasion of privacy in high school bathrooms,"Alabama, USA

So due to the growing rates of teenage vaping, my school has really been cracking down on vaping in school and such, it's an immediate 1 day suspension, 50 dollar fine, and court date if you are caught in school. My schools resource officer has been reportedly checking bathrooms every once and a while to catch kids vaping. Today I walked into the bathroom at the same time he did, he was checking in between the cracks of every single stall and when he came across some kid taking a shit, he laughed at him and moved on to the next. I'm beginning to think legal action should be involved because this is so fucking gross. Am I an idiot? Is this not invasion of expected privacy?

Boneless wings are better than bone in.,"More meat. Tasty breading. Less likely to be dry and stringy. No worries about cracking a tooth on a bone, or chewing cartilage on accident. It's also more socially acceptable to eat with a fork than regular bone in - you'll look like a lunatic if you put a wing on the end of your fork like that. Which means no sticky, smelly fingers.

Use a boat whenever possible while crossing flooded urban areas and use extreme caution when walking.

Update-I need more help. My ex deleted my BA thesis and it's due in 7 days,"I need additional help. Based on the advice from my last thread I took my laptop to the geek squad to recover the files. They said I'd have it back by the end of the week. That would leave me with enough time to finish the last section of my thesis paper. 

I got a call yesterday that it would actually take 2 weeks because they had to ship my laptop out for data recovery. Tried to explain that was unacceptable but nothing could be done about it. 

I'm not looking for technical advice. I need legal advice that I can use for my college and ex. My advisor said he can't give me an extension, which means I won't graduate next month and very likely could just fail out. Is there any legal basis for forcing my school to give me an extension? My paper and all of my qualitative data was deleted. Plus my backups were deleted. This whole situation is beyond my control. 

Is there any action I can take against my ex?

For the bot: I'm in Illinois. 

Edit:

[This is my original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b856m5/my_ex_deleted_my_ba_thesis_and_underlying/). Basically, my roommates and I had a party on Sunday. My ex showed up which is not unusual because we were on good terms and her friends are friends with my roommates. My computer was available for people to play their own playlists. Again, nothing unusual. I woke up on Monday and discovered all my emails were deleted (which is where I made weekly backups of my thesis). When I checked my hard drive, the folder with my thesis was deleted too. I freaked out, asked reddit for advice and took my computer to the geek squad. 

Texted my ex later on Monday asking if she deleted my thesis and didn't hear back. Her friend called me in tears saying my ex deleted everything and feels incredibly sorry and guilty. She did it because she saw me flirting with someone at the party and got jealous. 

I have a fellowship lined up after graduation that I'm not eligible for if I don't actually graduate. I need an extension until I get my files back. I'm completely completely screwed if I can't turn in my thesis. ",legaladvice

"I ""broke"" my friends laptop and she wants 600 dollars from me for it","A week ago, at a party, I accidentally walked into my friends laptop that was balancing on some thing to keep it up on the floor while we and other friends were drinking. It was fine, just a small crack on the charging port.


Up until today, she tells me she ""needs a new laptop"" because the charger has to be held at an angle to work now. I told her I'll help her with the cost of repair, but she tells me she needs a new one and wants me to cover the cost. Am I wrong to think she's just being greedy and using me? My gut instinct is to tell her I don't owe her a brand new laptop, I owe her the cost of repair. 

I don't want to make a big deal out of it, but she asked me late at night in a rather rude way with an attitude, when I just responded professionally asking what I can do to help cover the cost of repair. Not sure what the best course of action is. 

I don't have the money to buy her a new laptop and I truly refuse to do that, but I can gather up a little from my next pay cheque to help her with a repair.


edit: To clarify, she was balancing it on a small upside down trash can as she was sitting on the floor in front of it while doing her makeup while me and several other friends were predrinking in her room for the club.

What I think I'll end up doing is see how much a repair would be, and see if it's more than buying a used similar condition laptop. I'll help out with the price though, since we're both living pay to pay at the moment.",NoStupidQuestions

AITA for not honoring my son's punishment?,"Update 2: I told my ex to cancel her vacation as my son will not be going because it affects my custody time. Yes, I told her it was okay but after her husband's stunt of saying he couldn't do the sleepover which was on my day anyways, I had to crack the whip. Let those two eat each other alive. They deserve each other.

Update 1: This HILARIOUS. My son's best friend mom emailed us an invite for a sleepover which is on my DAY. I was going to see if my son wanted to go, but my ex's husband said my son could not go as he was grounded. I can react in so many ways...


His mom and I are divorced and don't have much of a relationship. Cordial, but indifferent. Our son is now 11 and my ex remarried a few years ago but she was with the guy for some time.

We have 50/50. She requested that she have him for two weeks for vacation. I agreed even though this ate into my time with him. Apparently, he got into it with step dad and he got grounded for a week. Well, most of that week is my week with him before he leaves for vacation with them and she asked me to see to it that his grounding continues through my time. I won't see him for three weeks. I am not saying not to punish him. 

Punish him when he's on their time. 

I have no problems with him when he's with me.

I refused.

I already made plans to make most if the days that I have him and I'm sure as hell am not going to cancel those plans because he mouthed off to step-dad. I don't care much for step-dad anyways. What I do with my son on my time is my business and vice-versa. 

Also, I don't want to set precedent where I am the parent who has to do both sides of discipline.


Edit: Update: My son called him a ""freaking asshole."" My ex calls him the same thing when they fight. Her words, not mine. He learned it from her, not me.

TIFU by sending nudes to my employee group chat.,"TLDR at the bottom- 

Well I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

We have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
The previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? 
The next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. 
I typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. I tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. Lol on the bright side the coworker I had a crush on...finally got his attention. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ

So I made a mistake tonight..and I'm ashamed of myself because this was completely out of character for me..but now I need to fess up. I'm going to give a bit of context and then sum up my questions underneath.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend left her laptop with me because it died and she needed me to try to recover family photos and documents from the last 7 years that would have all been lost. While transferring the data I was popping in and out of folders to make sure everything was being captured, when a particular phrase on one of the screenshots in a photo folder caught my eye..something she says to me often and we've come to sort of associate the phrase with us. The screenshot was her confession of love to someone she was with before I was around, ending with that quote, our quote.

&#x200B;

I couldn't leave well enough alone..and the next thing I knew I had opened up her internet browser..sure enough facebook was logged in. and I searched that phrase in the conversation history. There were..more than a few results. I read through some of them, more than I'd like to admit. I couldn't believe how many guys she had dated before me, she had never hidden it from me. I knew she had dated alot more people than I had, but the number of guys..I wasn't expecting it. Many of them she had said similar or the exact same things she says to me. Some conversations she had even sent out the same ""intimate"" photos I received from her when we started dating. (some of the guys were within a short span and didn't last very long) I'm a little hurt to be honest. Alot of the things I thought were exclusive to us were not, is this normal? I've always intentionally avoided saying things I used to say to exes.

&#x200B;

That aside, I know I messed up. I completely betrayed her trust by going through all those conversations and I need to come clean about it. On one hand I'm a little hurt..on the other I shouldn't have even known about this.  How can I discuss this with my partner in a healthy way? Is it fair for me to feel a little hurt at the same time?

Edit: Ok I wanted to clarify because alot of you seem to think I'm expecting an apology from her which I'm definitely not. I know that I screwed up and shouldn't have snooped. I violated a major boundary and I would be pissed if I were her (that's why I feel it needs to be confessed)  For the sake of being honest and open I'm going to talk to her about it and face the fallout. I think some of you are right and I have some..confused feelings about it. To my knowledge I don't make her feel anywhere close to what she's expressed with past partners and it is a little upsetting, not because I'm not the first one or because she's had ""too many"". That's not at all what I'm getting at..


&#x200B;

 TL;DR I snooped through my girlfriend's facebook chats with her exes and realized she says the exact same things to me that she said to all of them, and I feel bad for violating her trust and need to confess to her what I did.

Update: Hey everyone! Sorry for the delay between posts. 

So we talked it out. She agreed that it was an invasion of privacy but also says I have her permission to go through her messages anytime but to just tell her first..not the response I had expected. We had a decent conversation about both sides. Everything is good between us. Thank you all for your insights and messages it's greatly appreciated!",relationship_advice

Take a look at your bank account history and add up all the money you spend on food each month. Factor in your grocery expenses, fast food, coffee, snacks from the gas station, etc. Find the average and use that as a point of comparison for how much you spend while meal planning. This part isn't mandatory but I find it really neat to compare. Commit to 1 month of meal planning. Your comparison results will be skewed if you go off track.


**Meal planning**

1. First you need to think about how all the parts of you life, habits, and preferences should factor into your plan. How many people do you need to feed? How many nights do you want to cook? How long will you realistically eat leftovers for? Do you have an obligation one evening that could affect your plan? It's really important to think about all of these things and seriously consider your family's habits. For example, I won't eat leftovers twice. If I plan for that, I always end up going off track because 3 day old food is just not appealing to me. Also, I don't feel like cooking a big meal every night, so I build in an ""easy"" meal that I can make with my toddler that doesn't take a lot of time (think Grilled cheese and tomato soup). I also enjoy spending Sundays preparing a big meal, so I know that will influence which recipes I choose for the week.

2. Choose your recipes. It's important to read the instructions and ingredients before adding them to your list. There is nothing more frustrating than getting home ready to make your meal, and realizing it should have been marinated overnight. Also, if you see an ingredient you are not familiar with, check google for substitutes. That way if you get to the store and they don't carry it, you already have an alternative in mind. This happens often with health foods which might only be carried at specialty stores. If you're trying to save money, consider which ingredients (such as meat) will be more costly. **Bonus:** If you can find recipes that use the same ingredients, this will save you money. 

3. Figure out which recipes will be made which night. I personally plan my healthier meals at the beginning of the week because I'm more motivated. By Friday, I might want some comfort food to take a load off the stress of the week. There is some flexibility to switch around meals by night, but I like to space out my meals so that I'm not eating similar things two nights in a row. If you plan to eat out, be honest with yourself and add it in your plan/budget. Don't plan 7 nights of  cooking if you can't stick to it. If you plan a meal and eat out instead, you're wasting money and food. I personally plan 4 nights of real meals, 1 easy night, 1 ""fend for yourself night"" and 1 night of eating out. 

4. Plan your lunch. Some people meal-prep lunches at night, but I find that takes way too long. I also don't want to meal prep 5 lunches on Sunday that I am sick of by Wednesday. I always make enough dinner to have left overs for both my husband and I for lunch and plan one free day to buy lunch. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget.  

5. Plan your breakfast. The costs of coffee and breakfast sandwiches really add up. A quick, healthy breakfast is not hard to plan. I normally do oatmeal, fruit, eggs or english muffins. I pick one of those things and eat them all week. I will switch it up the following week. Each of these are good for a ""grab n go"" breakfast. 


**Make your grocery list**

1. Throughout the week, keep a sticky note on your fridge. Every time you run out of something, write it on the list.

2. Make a list of all the ingredients from each recipe.

3. Take inventory. Anything on your list that's already in your pantry you can cross off. If you notice your low on a staple, add it to your list. Don't forget to consider non-food essentials (toilet paper, cleaning supplies, toiletries, etc)

4. Add all items from your collected list from the past week. 

5. Share your list with family/roommates. They can tell if you if there is something you are forgetting or if they have a request. 

6. Now re-organize your list by department. This is important. It will help you move through the grocery store more efficiently without having to go back for something you missed. I separate mine by: Dry, Frozen, non-food, dairy, bakery, meat, and produce. 


**Get to the store**

1. Don't forget to grab your coupons!

2. At the store, stay focused! If it's not on your list, don't buy it. Period. Impulse shopping is no good.

3. Start with the inner isles. Canned goods, non-food, etc. those are heavier and nothing is worse than having cans on top of tomatoes.

4. Finish up with bakery, meat and produce. If you are planning healthy meals, this should be the bulk of your cart. Produce is cheap relatively cheap and if you fill your cart with it, you will save money!

5. Double check that you've crossed everything off your list before you leave!

**TIP:** Don't forget to buy on sale, but only if it's a smart move. *DON'T* ""buy one get one half off"" on perishable items that you won't eat within the week. *DO* take up good deals on your essentials (rice, frozen vegetables, oils, condiments). Make sure to compare sales. Sometimes the store brand price is already lower than the name brand sale.


There you have it! That's really my entire meal planning and shopping process. From there, all you have to do is start cooking. It takes practice to get it down, but when you've got it figured out, it starts to get easy.


**Here are some additional tips I would recommend:**

1. Type your meal plan with links to recipes and save them. When you don't feel like meal planning, you can resort to the archives.

2. If you don't have a food processor, get one! It's cheap and saves you so much prep time.

3. Crock pot meals are amazing for those nights you want to get home and just relax. Only problem is you have to prepare them the night before or in the morning. 

4. Sign up for emails from sites like MyFitnessPal or Cooking Light. It's a great place for inspiration. 

5. Plan to have a night that you don't need a recipe for. Grilled chicken and frozen broccoli requires like... zero brainwork. After a long day, that's important.

6. Remember that cooking is an art! Once you have enough experience in the kitchen, you don't need to spend as much time finding recipes. I'm at the point where I use recipes for inspiration,  but I change them depending on my preferences. 

6. Remember to bring your lunch! What's the point in all this if you end up buying lunch everyday anyway?! Seriously, set an alarm on your phone if you have to. But DONT FORGET YOUR LUNCH.

7. Plan desserts. I have a weakness for cookies. I actually might be addicted. If I plan in a night of cookie baking, it helps me from running to McDonald's at 9pm.

8. Remember to stay stocked on your pantry staples. [This list](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/articles/basic-pantry-101.html) can help you determine what those are

Edit: sorry guys I really dont know how to format so I've had to mess around with this a lot!

**EDIT 2:** I've gotten some requests to share a sample meal plan. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4s-npIJ0K85RktBMkF1dEduZ1lfV191bHhNcUo3dkVwUHp3/view?usp=sharing) is an example.

AITA for calling the police on my kid?,"Daughter is 16. Her mom and I are divorced.Daughter has been caught smoking pot several times from the age of 14. Her mom and I have collectively punished her several times for this. The last time we caught her, I started drug testing her. Her mom doesn't agree with it, but we have caught her so many times now that I think this is the best way to prevent her from doing it.

I don't normally go through her room, but the router for the house is in there, and I needed to reset it. When I go into her room, I found a mushroom cap on black paper hidden underneath her desk. I look up what the hell it is and it is a spore print for magic mushrooms. I go through her room further to find an entire damn aqarium filled with mushrooms in the back of her closet. obviously I am enraged, so I wait for her to get back from school, and I called the police. She was arrested, booked and released into her mother's custody.

Her mother is pissed, and saying that I may have ruined the kids life for no reason, but we have tried to correct her drug abuse several times to no avail, and it has escalated. She now has a court date and can answer to the law since she doesn't take the rules in my house seriously. I doubt she'll get more than probation anyway.

My parents are also pissed though, saying that this could have been handled inside the home, and that's why I'm here. I'm wondering if I over reacted and would like a more impartial judgment.

&#x200B;

I am making and edit to respond to a few things.

This was a small ten gallon tank. I guess people are picturing something larger. There were a lot of mushrooms in there though. My daughter has a small walk in closet that is, honestly, so messy that I don't bother to look in there too much. Because she has been passing her drug tests, I have been cutting her slack. I honestly would not have called the police if I thought that she was going to get a jail sentence at all.",AmItheAsshole

Paternity tests should be a routine procedure required by law at birth.,"There are plenty of women who would be offended if their partner asked for a paternity test. A lot of men become trapped by this and only discover a child is not theirs many years after the fact. 

When a woman gives birth, there is also bound to be a man in the equation who now has to decide if he is going to raise this child or not. When making this decision, it should be a man's right to know without a shadow of a doubt whether he is the biological father of the child or not.

TIFU by sexually harassing a 9 year old boy,"TIFU, and it actually happened today. I was driving with my 12 year old daughter. We got caught at a red light next to a restaurant. I glanced at the restaurant and saw a kid walking in the parking lot by himself. It looked like my daughter's friend Gabe. I said to her, ""is that..."" and before I could even finish, she said yes. 

So I suggested we say hi to him. I rolled down my window and screamed ""Gabe!"" The kid turned around, and that's when I realized it wasn't Gabe. It was a younger boy, maybe 9 years old. 

So here's the thing. This kid isn't Gabe. God only knows if he's even heard the name Gabe before. And it's a busy intersection, so it's noisy. 

The kid had such a puzzled and embarrassed look on his face, and he ran to his car. And that's when I realized, this 9 year old kid thinks a middle aged woman just rolled down her car window, screamed ""gay!!!"" at him, and drove away. My daughter laughed her ass off at me. 

TL;DR: I called an elementary school kid gay while stopped at a red light.

Edited for a typo. The kid was walking. Not waking, not wanking. Just walking.",tifu
I called 911 for a medical emergency and the police showed up and verbally harassed/threatened me. Should I file a complaint? (Pennsylvania),"I don't really know where to file this under flairs.

Tonight, I had to call an ambulance to my apartment. My boyfriend was acting erratic and seemed to be in psychosis. He then had a full-on seizure. 

Later on, I found out he smoked synthetic marijuana. I don't know much about that. I do not do drugs. I do not even smoke normal marijuana. I called an ambulance because I didn't know what else to do - I was scared. 

Three policemen showed up first and entered without knocking. Asked where he was. I started to cry and they told me to go in the other room as I was annoying them. I complied. Then, the larger of the three cornered me in the hallway.

He said my pupils were completely ""blown"" and I better start telling the truth about what drugs I do. I told him that I have incredibly poor eye sight and my pupils have been naturally large since childhood - this is true. He told me, ""stop fucking lying to me now or you're getting arrested for drug possession."" Again, I denied any drug use and told him he could literally drug test me through blood and urine at that exact moment - I am clean. He left me in the hallway and another man came out, rinse and repeat. Then the third did the same thing. They kept telling me to look at lights and laughing and saying I was the biggest liar they had ever met. At this point I'm amped up and scared. I am a 23 year old woman. I am in nursing school. I do not do drugs.

At this point, they have the ems there coming or and checking my pupils and laughing. They were telling my boyfriend that he better rat on both of us or we were both going to jail. They ripped apart my whole entire room and starting laying into me for having cipro prescribed (an antibiotic). The largest policeman then told me he was going to speak to my landlord and have me evicted.  I reiterated that I am completely clean and could pass not only a field sobriety test but a drug test of any kind. He retorted with ""I highly doubt that"" as he continued to tear apart my home.

Eventually, they got my boyfriend into the ambulance and all three of the cops left laughing. The largest turned around and said, ""Congratulation on ruining your life. don't call an ambulance when you are on drugs, I'll see you around"".

Not only am I shaken, but I feel threatened and ashamed. The man I was with should not have been on anything, but I called an ambulance because I was scared he might die! I didn't call them to be harassed. Did they even do anything really wrong that I can report this? We live in a small town in NEPA. I know that they heard a possible drug incident over the scanner and had three of them show up because they thought they'd find a good amount of drugs/an incident of interest. They found absolutely nothing. No one got arrested or charged. They also refused to give me any badge numbers and told me if I kept inquiring I'd be in more trouble.

AITA for kicking my sister out of my wedding during the reception?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I got married last Saturday. Hooray for me! My sister was my maid of honor. During her speech, she brought up her depression and how my husband supported her through it and how ""in that moment, I knew he was the one for throwaway..."" (so cliche!). I thought her speech was really selfish. I think it's super inappropriate to bring up a mental illness during a wedding speech. Not only that, but the entire speech was about her. At MY wedding. 90% of the guests congratulated her afterwards and talked about how ""strong"" she was. Nobody was paying attention to me, at my own wedding! Sorry if I sound selfish, but IMO there is a time and a place for this sort of thing. So after the guests all greeted her, I asked her to leave and told her she was being disruptive and selfish. She was really upset but just left without arguing. My parents agree with me. but my husband and all of my close friends think I was way too harsh. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
I don't want my twin sister in my wedding party and my mom can't handle it.,"My twin sister and I have had a horrible relationship for the last 23 years of our life. The kind of relationship that people said ""oh you'll get over when you're older"". Except I'm not over it. She physically and verbally abused me my entire life and continues to do so over trivial things now. 

When I was 18 I ended up moving 44 hours away from my family, but it was to get away from her. She's ruined most of my friendships and I just couldn't handle her anymore. After moving, her and I have been for the most part NC. When we do talk it's always for her to start a fight. Either making me feel bad for not coming home for a holiday, or just something. 

Most of my family understands our relationship but my mom, as she has for my entire life continues to be oblivious to it. ""Oh it's not that bad"" or ""All siblings fight"". She's the kind of  mom you see in those movies saying ""my baby would never do that"", as the child is getting hauled away for murder ... Yep that would be her.  I've been in therapy for the last 5 year to try and get over our relationship.

 But aside from the whole woe is me...

Two months ago I got engaged to the most amazing person. And as one would, I called my parents, then called my older sister and finally I called my twin. Hoping that she would be happy for me, or idk just something..... Welp, she was not. She told me how selfish I was for getting engaged to a man who lived so far away and how she already knows I'm never going to come back home. How selfish that is to my mother and went on like that until I hung up about 30 minutes later. She told me that I should be ashamed for asking guests and my family to come to my wedding so far away. Which I had already planned to offer at least half the cost of plane tickets. Even more for my family.. but whatever. 


This month we have begun to plan the first details of the wedding. The guest maximum for the ceremony would be 100 and I think that's even more than I was thinking originally. As I'm really just wanting it to be close friends and family. We were planning to invite more people to the reception (is that normal? I've never been to a wedding before), people with kids and friends that I'm not as close to. 

We have decided that at most each of us would have 4 bridesmaids/groomsmen. I'm still trying to figure out who will be it as well. However, already I know that the last person I want to be my MOH is my sister. I don't really even want her being in my bridal party. That decision has all but crushed my mother. She's really really upset about it. Calling me names and telling me how selfish I am for not being able to let go of our childhood. 

I hate to see her upset. However I know that having my sister in one of those roles will for sure lead to fights and I really don't want to be judged for every decision I make. 

Would it ruin my relationship with my sister forever if I don't have her in my wedding? I would like to have some sort of relationship one day. What can I do and how would I even tell her that she's not in the party without causing a fight

*** Update****

Thank you for the support everyone! It's been quite a busy couple of weeks for my fiance and I. I have decided not to have my sister in my party and invite her to the reception only. My fiance's groomsmen/ brothers understand the situation and will be playing security. I will keep you all updated as things progress.

Suing a firearm company because their firearm was used in a shooting is the stupidest thing ever .,"Suing a company because their firearm was used in a shooting makes 0 sense.

If someone drinks and drives and kills someone are you going to sue the alcohol company ? Or the maker of the car ?

If I sell someone a pen and then they turn around and stab someone to death with that pen , am I at fault ?

UPDATE 2: Just found out my husband (28M) invited another woman over to spend the night while I'm (24F) away on business. How to proceed?,"Thank you to everyone who has commented on my last two posts. I haven't been able to respond to everyone, and I'm still working through all the comments, but the advice, stories, and love you've shared has been overwhelming and absolutely needed. Thank you. Even the people calling me names and calling me out for not being stronger - thank you.

It hurt to come to the realization that we can't move forward from this. He's betrayed my trust so many times that I'd need him to verify pretty much anything for awhile, and that's no way for either of us to live. 

The fact of the matter is that we're both pretty broken, and have no business being in a relationship with each other, or anyone else right now. I truly don't believe he's a terrible person, but he has been a terrible partner. Like many of you said, he can be a good person and not be good for me. 

Last night, I chickened out. I was so scared of losing him forever that I said we should just take a break, have him fly home, and work on ourselves for a bit. There were a lot of tears, but when the conversation was over, I didn't feel better, just... stuck. 

This morning, I realized what I'd done. I did this the last time I tried to get out of an abusive relationship, and put up safeguards so I could feel comfortable leaving. My husband doesn't deserve to be led on, and I don't deserve to be unable to move on. I read through more of your messages, and I can't thank you all enough for your words of comfort, encouragement, and strength. 

The thing is, for you it's black and white. For me, my thoughts are so thoroughly clouded by emotions and history, and I have to let that all go. The best thing I can do for both of us is to give up. 

So this morning, I did. I told him that while we could take a break and try again, it would never work. I can never truly trust him again, and he wants me to change things about myself that are things I love and have no desire to change. We've been trying so hard for so long to make things work that we're just too far gone. 

There were lots of tears, but he took it well. He's agreed to a no-contest divorce, and we'll spend the next few days packing up our house before the lease is up at the end of the month. Some of you may come at me with pitch forks for not screwing him over, or breaking up last night, or leaving him to deal with the house alone, but that's okay. I'll be staying at my friend's house until my new apartment is ready, and really focusing on just working on myself. I won't help him pack unless I have someone with me. Much of the stuff is mine anyway, and I'd rather not leave it behind. You guys are right that my self-confidence has taken a nose dive lately. I have a lot of healing to do before I'm ready to consider love again, and I have two appointments scheduled with my therapist this week. This man is not a monster in my book, he's a little boy that needs to grow up. We both made our fair share of mistakes in this relationship, but rather than feeling sorry for myself, I'm choosing to take those lessons and move on. I'm the kind of person who is very good at bouncing back, it's just the getting out that's hard. Thank you all for your help in that. I wish him all the best, and simply have no desire to harbor hate in my heart. 

**Because I know how easy it is for manipulated, abused women to go right back, I've talked a lot with my family and close friends over the last 48 hours. I previously didn't share a lot of what was happening with them because I was embarrassed. Everyone always said we were  the perfect couple, and I was so ashamed of all the problems we had. I've informed these people that they are not to let me go back, should it come to that, in no uncertain terms. I don't think I'll get to that point, but I just want to be sure.

Edit: As a side note, I shared it for me, because damn I needed the loving slap in the face that this sub so gracefully provides. But I also shared it because I hope that anyone else who reads my story and sees parallels in their own life will have the strength and courage to put themselves first.

"TIFU by asking my neighbor ""Who died?""","So this happened like 2 hours ago, but it needs some preface.

About 3 weeks ago my neighbor saw me dressed in all black leaving for work and he asked me, ""Who died?"" I laughed. He laughed. We all had a good time. Today‚ÄîI'm heading to my car, and I see him and his wife dressed in all black so I obviously asked, ""Who died?""
 
His wife breaks down and starts HARDCORE CRYING. Turns out her mom had just died. She then proceeds to lecture me about making fun of death as she's still crying at a 6/10. Her husband never said anything about the fact that he made the same joke 3 weeks ago, which is fine. I wouldn't have either. 

So now I'm gonna avoid her forever. I know it's not the craziest TIFU, but now I'll respect death forever.

AITA for telling my mom she's the reason I don't want any kids?,"I (23F) am the oldest of 4 siblings. My dad passed away when I was 14, leaving us and my mom. 

There's a bit of an age gap between me and my siblings. So when my dad passed my mom looked at me for babysitting duties. Walking them to school, getting them ready in the morning, cooking for them, helping them with homework, getting them in bed at the right time, all that. If I had to guess I'd say I spend 4 hours a day minimum taking care of them, most days more. Plus an hour or so on chores. 

Now I love my siblings, and I love my mom. But from when I was 14 till I moved out at 19 I had no social life, no hobbies, barely any friends. All there was was taking care of them, chores, school, and from 16 to later work too. 

I'm on good terms with my mom, we meet for coffee about twice a month to catch up. I've been in a steady relationship for over 2.5 years, so whenever we meet my mom brings up marriage and kids. I've politely told her I don't want any of that yet, possibly ever, so she can stop asking. 

When she kept pushing (spread out over several visits after I told her to stop asking) i told her ""Giving up my youth to take care of someone else's kids because they couldn't ruined the idea of having kids myself for me."" I didn't mean to be rude, but it's true. 

She cried. I told her I don't blame her, but that it still wasn't a good position to be put in as a teen. I didn't apologise. 

AITA?

Edit: When I said ""taking care of someone else's kids because they couldn't"" I wasn't trying to be malicious. 
A) She at that moment in time, genuinely couldn't, which is why I had to. 
B) I called them 'someone else's kids' because they don't feel like siblings anymore, I had to carry way too much responsibility to just feel like a big sister. 

I wasn't trying to be mean about it, but that's why I said it that way.

Edit 2: Yes, I'm aware my mom struggled too, lost her partner, had to work. I was there. I never said I don't sympathise or that it was easy for her. I'm sympathetic to my mom's situation, but that doesn't change the fact that my teenage years where very tough, and I don't want kids because of that.

Edit 3: For the people PMing and commenting about how it's my fault I didn't have friends and not my mom's: I wasn't allowed to bring friends home, my mom was scared it would distract me from watching my siblings.

Last edit: For everyone asking, my mom worked 9-6:30.

Actually the last edit: My mom came home around 6:30, that didn't mean I only watched the kids till 06:30. I usually was the one who cooked dinner and put them to bed, my mom was tired after work.",AmItheAsshole

Once upon a time there lived a ravishing Queen with huge tits..,"Nick the Dragon Slayer obsessed over the Queen for this reason. He knew that the penalty for his desire would be death should he try to touch them, but he had to try. 

One day Nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,Horatio the Physician, the King's chief doctor.Horatio thought about this, and said that he could arrange for Nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. 

Without pause Nick readily agreed to the scheme. 

The next day, Horatio made a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the Queen's bra while she bathed. Soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense. 

Upon being summoned to the Royal Chambers to address this incident, Horatio informed the King and Queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and that tests had shown that only the saliva of Nick would work as the antidote to cure the itch.

The King, eager to help his Queen, quickly summoned Nick to their chambers. 

Horatio then slipped Nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, Nick worked passionately on the Queen's large and magnificent breasts. The Queen's itching was eventually relieved, and Nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

Upon returning to his chamber, Nick found Horatio demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. With his obsession now satisfied, Nick couldn't have cared less knowing that Horatio could never report this matter to the King and with a laugh told him to get lost.

The next day, Horatio slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the King's underwear. The King immediately summoned Nick.

I want to ask my (M34) business partner (F31) to be with me romantically. How do I go about changing the context of our relationship?,"

**Background**: my childhood friend (F31) and I (M34) started a business together right out of college. We worked our asses off and became fairly successful. But we put our hearts and souls into it, and because of that our social lives suffered a lot. She was always better at balancing than I and had a long term boyfriend until about 7 months ago. They broke up- in part because he said she always prioritized the business over him (though they were also long distance at the end and that also played a role). 

She showed up at my house crying. We hang out, drink wine, watch movies. I'm chronically single and tipsy and she was now single and tipsy plus neither of us had had sex in a while and one thing led to another. We agreed the next day never to discuss it again. We didn't want to fuck up everything we've worked for or our friendship.

Well, this wasn't to be because she ended up pregnant. Zero scares with the ex, one night of drunken sex, bam pregnant. We discussed abortion, but she decided not to go through with it because she was concerned she wouldn't get another chance to be a mom. We agreed it could happen with someone far worse, we're already pretty irrevocably financially tied anyways, and we get along better than most people who actually tried to have kids. 

Living together just made sense- I have a house I inherited that's bigger than what either of us could've afforded just on our incomes, so there's room for each of us to have a bedroom plus a room for the baby. We spend most of our days together anyways because of work, so living together actually made that easier- now we can carpool. We have separate rooms, though we have been intimate since she moved in and sometimes share a bed. 

 I want to be with her. But I don't know how to move to that step. She's literally next to me asleep in bed. We go out to dinner together, spend most of our time together. I just don't know how to move that into a romantic context, or even if it's a good idea. I mentioned it to my sister who blew up at me and accused me of trapping her, and said that my partner would think I'm asking just because she's pregnant. But the truth is that I think I've always loved her, but I didn't want to admit it because she's way out of my league. 

So, what do I do? How do I change the context of the relationship when we're already so (financially, living together, family, etc) intertwined? 

TL;DR- I got my best friend/business partner pregnant, she moved in with me, I realized I love her, I don't know how to show her.

AITA for singling someone out at a comedy show?,"I do stand up. I also have a day job, because, you know, survival. 

I mentioned at work that I couldn't do any shifts after 4:00 on Saturday because I had a show. My coworker overheard and asked for tickets so he could take a girl out without having to spend money. 

I had no problem helping him out and I knew this club wouldn't care if I slid a couple people in. But I've been trying to get more bookings at this place and it's kind of a level up from the sort of places I usually get to perform at so I told them, you know, ""please make a point to laugh.""

I'm up there doing my show and I see them and they're the only ones in the relatively intimate audience who aren't laughing. It bugs me a little but I didn't want to lose my rhythm so just ignored them. Then I see that in this dark room that seats, max, forty people this guy is texting with his phone screen on full brightness. 

So I start telling a joke about a time I gave friends from work tickets to see me and they texted through the whole thing and as I'm doing it I'm slowly approaching their table (and the audience realizes I'm talking about these people at this show) yet he doesn't notice or look up until I'm literally off the stage, approaching the foot of his table, staring at him. 

It killed, so that was the good part. But when I showed up to work I was expecting an apology from him. Instead HE was expecting an apology from me for (I'm quoting here) ""inviting him out just to make him the butt of a joke"" ""making him look like a fool in front of his girl"" and embarrassing him at a popular venue in our reasonably small town. 

He basically summarized it as ""you're supposed to be a professional and if you couldn't handle me texting you shouldn't be in show business.""

I think, without question, that he's the asshole. But he doesn't believe me and the only people I could tell this story to and ask to confirm I'm not crazy and my real life friends, so, biased.

"[CA] My boss told me that I don't get a lunch break for my 8-hour shift because I ""can eat at the desk.""","Hello, LA. 

About a month ago, I started working at for a large hotel company. I am a night auditor. I work 11pm-7am. I have a fair amount of downtime during my shift. 

However, I do not get rest breaks or a meal period. When I asked my boss about it, she said, ""You don't get a lunch."" She said this was due to the amount of downtime and the fact that I can eat a bite here or there throughout the night. Practically, this translates to me having to just stand at the desk for the whole shift, with no ability to sit or be off-duty at all.

I was given the meal period waiver during my onboarding and I did not sign it. I have not given my consent to waive my meal period (which only applies to six-hour shifts, anyway).

Update: [FL]Neighbors/tenants cutting down my magnolia trees w/o consent,"Link to original post in case you need it: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants\_cutting\_down\_my\_magnolia\_trees/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8wkt4x/flneighborstenants_cutting_down_my_magnolia_trees/?context=10)

I've received a number of messages begging for an update, but as it's only been a few months, I can only give a partial one, due to the ongoing legal issues (my attorneys have advised me not to divulge too much to anyone).

1) The day after my post, I called a good friend of mine who has been my go to plumber since I inherited the property (we went to high school together), to ask for his help. He went to both houses the next day, saying that I had called him last week since the water bill seemed high, and asked him to come look at the pipes. He went through the houses, surreptitiously taking pictures, while ""inspecting"" the bathrooms/kitchens/water boilers, etc for leaks. Apparently while he was there they made a bunch of comments about me that included racial slurs (tldr: i'm biracial, and do not pass for white) and such about how I need to learn my place. After he'd inspected both houses he came over to mine, and gave me all the photos.

2) I conferred with an attorney regarding evicting them, and four days later both families were served with 7 day eviction notices. As expected, they blew up, and started throwing rocks at my house, slinging more racial epithets in my direction. I'd always grown up being terrified of angry racist white men twice my size, I never realized how unbelievably pathetic they actually are until I watched them crying like babies while being hauled off by the police on the video cameras.

3) The bride made a very angry post on facebook, followed up by standing up in church (small town, most of us go to the same church) during ""prayers and concerns"" to beg for prayers for her family because ""Our landlord is evicting all of us because she's jealous that I'm getting married!"" The pastor, feigning innocence, said ""I thought she was evicting you all because your father and \[Groom\]'s father cut down \[My Great-Grandmother\]'s prize magnolias?"" Hardest game of You-Laugh-You-Lose I've ever played, still proud I survived.

4) According to the arborists (yes plural. though my friend came out and did an assessment, my attorney for the suit over the trees advised selecting someone who isn't so close to me for the paperwork we'll submit to the court), based on the number of trees cut down and the number of trees damaged beyond repair, and how old/well-tended those trees were, the value of the trees alone is more than i could sell all three houses for in the current housing market around here. Then the attorney started talking about how the damages are multiplied and let's just say I would be quite happy with half that number, but I know when to zip my lips so I'll let my attorneys handle the negotiating.

5) They did, in fact, destroy the houses as best they could. I have enough savings/inheritance left that I can live without the rents for a while, so I'm using it as an excuse to have both houses renovated since they haven't had major renovations since well before I was born.

6) The bride and groom got married and had their reception in the church basement instead of the cul-de-sac. They had to cancel the honeymoon to spend the money on legal fees. (Am I a bad person for being amused?)

7) Hurricane Michael just gave me some wild thunderstorms, thankfully passed over us with the worst of it.

8) My boyfriend of seven years proposed (finally, goddamn).

AITA for kicking my pregnant girlfriend out of my house when I found out the child wasn't mine?,"My ex and I had been together for 2 years.  It was rocky for the last couple months when she lost her job and just seemed to refuse to look for work just living for free in my house causing me to have to financially support us both.  I also suspected she was cheating on me, and eventually I broke up with her and she left to live with her parents.

A few weeks later she comes knocking on my door to let me know she's pregnant with my child.  She was practically beaming with glee.  I agreed to let her stay with me again as my home would be a healthier place to stay as her mom smokes like a chimney and refused to stop smoking inside when she found out her daughter was pregnant.  Didn't want my child subjected to that.

The one caveat to this arrangement being we would go in a couple weeks and get a paternity test done.  She very happily agreed.  Her reaction actually washed away some of the fears I had about her possibly cheating on me.  So she lives with me for a couple weeks and we go to get the test done.  We find out that the child isn't mine and like a switch is flipped I honestly no longer care about that kid anymore and tell her to pack up her shit and get out of my house.

This was a week ago.  She moved her stuff back to her parents house, but is staying with a friend to avoid the cigarette smoke and other problems there.  She, her friends, and even a few of our mutual friends are texting and messaging me about how I'm a terrible person for doing this to that innocent child.  That I have plenty of room in my home and I should just help her out.  I feel like I've been through the emotional ringer these past months and I've been though every emotion I am capable of feeling.  From realizing I was possibly a father to the betrayal when her cheating was confirmed...honestly I feel so emotionally raw and sometimes I agree with them.  That maybe I should take her back and just care for the kid.

"AITA for dropping the ""We're Not Having Kids, Now Stop Bringing It Up"" bomb on my MIL?"," My husband and I don't want kids. My MIL is big into family in the traditional sense. She has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. Literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

My husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. Every time we see her, she asks. Everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""We might not even have kids"" and MIL would *not*hear it. At year 4, husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal.

So this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some BBQ and drinks and everything. When I get up to grab a beer, my MIL asks me if maybe I should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

I was annoyed by this and said ""There's really no chance.""

MIL, all wide-grin, said, ""Oh come on! It's time for you two to finally get serious! Put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

I said ""We've been official for about 5 years now, MIL,"" and drink the beer. Husband laughs with me.

MIL gets more annoyed and says ""Well, you won't be REAL (Lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

Husband said, ""Mom, enough."" MIL pushed again. Husband repeated.

After about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, I finally snapped and said ""MIL, Husband got snipped. I had my tubes tied. We're not having kids. You need to stop bringing it up. Period.""

Well, I thought I started WWIII. She started crying and stormed off. Family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. We left. Party kinda ended. The social media bullshit started shortly after. Vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. Some meme about how ""I guess I wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" It's obnoxious to the point that I just muted all of them.

My MIL finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if Husband and I came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. I told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""Well then, I guess you two aren't prepared to be REAL (Lastname)s. I'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (It wasn't that much. It was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

I hung up on her. When recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that I was the asshole here for dropping it like that. But I don't think she was ever going to drop it if I didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. So AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.,"I have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that I hang out with almost every day. We've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, John. 

I never really liked John. He was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. He was also incredibly pretentious. A friend of mine said ""Einstein"" once and John interrupted him to say, ""I have no idea who you are talking about. Do you mean the reknown scientist Albert EinSHTein?"". I once put up a snapchat story saying, ""I love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""It's called gridiron you moron"".  I don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

On one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. John was kind of tipsy. We had some new girls show up so I was kinda working my charm on them. They asked me what I did and I went ""I'm a Biomed Engineer"". I don't know why that triggered John so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how I'm just a drone in a rat race. He kept telling me about how I'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. He later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

Every time I mention work or anything, John would start roasting me. He nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though I expressed multiple times that I dont like to be called a drone. He would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what I do. That really pissed me off. Once I told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""What are you going to do, fight me? I dare you to swing"". I didn't want to fight him so now I started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

Over the last few months or so I kinda went frontpage a couple of times on Reddit and everyone was like, ""damn M0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). That triggered him even more. He'd say stuff like ""His posts suck. They're not even funny. Reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


At this point it is relevant to bring up what John does. He's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at Starbucks. How good is he? Honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a DSLR, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. Over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. I'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an Instagram post about how National Georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

Last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. At the party, I apologized to him (I hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""I'm sorry you didn't get Nat Geo"". To which he got angry again and said, ""I'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. What I'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so I actually feel sorry for you"". He said stuff like this in front of a girl I was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

That's it. I fucking lost it. We were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with John and I took that opportunity to say, ""Well John, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder Nat Geo rejected you. You're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iPhone camera. You're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *I get cut off here*"" 

His dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. John came charging at me but everyone just held him back. The rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and I got kicked out. No one has talked to me since the incident and John blocked me from all social media. Our group chat has been pretty silent too. John also apparently made a roast post about me. Idk if I should apologize to him or not. Sorry for the long post. I know John is an asshole, but AITA? ",AmItheAsshole

I'm pretty sure she has undiagnosed narcissistic personality disorder so it's possible she will completely deny or has built a different reality of that event. 

I found out because my Dad casually dropped into conversation one day what it was like to watch my mum pick me up and throw me through the door. Random dad.

I am often lost in this world of pain from my past again and have a history of drugs/ alcohol/ eating disorders/ depression. I've worked very hard to get to a stable and content place with myself and finding this out has derailed me somewhat. 

Is it just going to hurt more bringing it up with my mum or relieve the suffering?

Ps I'm in New Zealand so will go to sleep now but will check in in the morning. Thanks for your input and kindness, it feels so good to talk about it as I've been feeling very stuck.",relationship_advice
[UPDATE]I'm feeling a lot of anger about this child[M5] of my[M39] wife's[F39] affair that I've been talked into being a father figure for.,"[First post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cctm2u/im_feeling_a_lot_of_anger_about_this_childm5_of/)

Hey everyone it's been a few weeks since you heard from me. I guess I'm kind of in a spot to update now.

So, my post got a lot of feedback and it was *pretty much* unanimous. I heard from lots of people; parents and sons and daughters in blended families, people who'd been cheated on themselves, people who were Max in their own families and you all told me what I should have been able to admit myself, that this was not normal, that no one had ever heard of an arrangement like this.

I resolved to end the arrangement and met with my ex wife and her partner to tell them a few days after I posted, midway through their custody week. Many people advised me to speak to my boys about it first, like my ex did to me, but I wanted to deliver the message before having to take Max again. I was thinking that it might be better to instead call them out on that behaviour and try to get them to agree not to include the boys in that level of discussion before me, and then we could all sit down with the boys.

The meeting did not go well. They were both pretty mad at me. I had tried to prepare for it to be uncomfortable. I told myself just to be polite and firm, that I didn't owe them an explanations beyond ""I'm sorry, its not working out"". I guess he had made some career move based on this schedule that I was fucking up. In hindsight I do feel sort of responsible for that frustration, in that I regret agreeing to this arrangement in the first place, but in the moment I really was not giving a fuck about this man's work life balance. Then, he said something about how I wasn't being ""fair"", that they just wanted a ""fair"" custody arrangement. That made me very mad. Thinking about this all to type it out has my heart hammering. I have some different opinions on ""fairness"". I said some pretty shitty, regrettable things to both of them and then we were all screaming at each other for awhile and then I stormed out and I didn't talk to the boys.

I didn't get to talk to my boys for several days until hand off. They immediately were asking about why Max wasn't with them and I, prepared for it, held a more serious talk with them than I had up to this point. I talked about how its great that they enjoy spending time with Max, but that I'm their father and that Max has his own father to spend time with. I also talked about how this whole spectacle of our lives is difficult for me, that I don't like having to spend only every other week with them. That their mother's decision to start another family with Max's father and Max still makes me sad. This is pretty awfully difficult stuff to talk about. I've been pretty strict with myself about not venting to my son's about their mother up until now, but effectively that's meant I haven't really talked about her or our breakup at all. If you can't say anything nice, as they say.

Trying to maintain that respect for their mother and also talk frankly about my own feelings is a difficult tightrope balance. I don't want to blame their mother, but I also don't want to *not* blame their mother, if you know what I mean. This would be one of the situations I identify as ""unfair"", where the responsible thing is to never say anything disparaging or ""poisonous"" to my sons about their mother, my ex, but that means I have to describe the current state of affairs and what has happened to get here in a way that isn't disparaging to their mother and act like this is normal. ""She decided"".

I think I actually did a good job navigating the conversation. My sons absorbed it easier than I expected. A few weeks later and things with them are basically normal. 

I have had a few short conversations with my ex since our big embarrassing blowup. I sort of feel like I want her to apologize for this whole thing, but also know that I'm not doing myself any favours waiting for that to happen. I think she remains upset with me, more for the things I said than the rejection of this arrangement with Max. Or maybe that's just projection, because that's what I feel guilty for. I also regret that the last time I spoke to Max was dropping him off before ending the arrangement. I don't know. I guess his mom has explained to him that she missed him too much, to have him gone each week, but I don't know how sturdy that story will be.

Rereading my last post has me feeling pretty shameful of how I talked about Max. I know he doesn't deserve my sustained ire and that he's not going anywhere, so I'll have to be able to adjust to his presence. I'm obviously holding on to a lot of anger that is really about my ex wife but she isn't obligated to give a shit about that and I am obligated to interact with her politely so I guess that anger just got set aside and then vented onto Max just because he was there in my face, but that was my own fault.

So, I sort of expect things will pretty much return to normal from here. Contact with my ex is curt right now, but that'll loosen up.

Reddit has become the place where the childhood bullied become the bullies,"Let me explain. The Reddit community is the most condescending trash I have ever seen. They constantly put others down to bolster their own insecurities, subs like r/trashy serve this exact purpose of 'we're better than them.'

Now for my title, in highschools of old (maybe 5-10 years ago) nerds, geeks, and just non popular people would be bullied, most of these people now make their way onto Reddit.

The majority of people here are extremely critical of intelligence to the point where it could be considered bullying. You get one thing wrong they will pounce onto you and just shut everything you have to say with 'you're not smart, remember when you said this.' one of the biggest targets is the general populace, who are heavily subject to the 'superior' redditors. This is just used to treat their insecurities in saying 'we're special and different right? We're smart' no you're not, you're literally a clone of every neckbeard redditor on the site so stfu",unpopularopinion
AITA for telling my extended family how many men (roughly) my sister has slept with after she outed our youngest brother as a virgin?,"We had a family dinner this evening. My family has four kids in total: me, my elder sister (29F), younger sister (24F) and youngest brother (22M).

Extended family attended our family dinner. So all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. During the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. My sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. The two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

Eventually my sister got really fed up and said ""Shut up, I'm not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin."" My brother hadn't done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. I think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

Anyway, I immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. She replied by saying everyone knows he's a virgin and she didn't say anything wrong. This annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn't need to be made fun of like this.

So I responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it's not a big deal right? Turns out her husband didn't know this amazingly, I genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

Family is blaming me for their marital problems. I refuse to accept I did anything wrong. My sister bullied my brother in front of everyone, all I did was give her a taste of her own medicine.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU: I have officially branded myself as the biggest perv... and I 100% deserve it...,"This is his now ex-wife.

Did he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.

I've removed all of this personal story for my family's protection and changed this account's password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.

I took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!

I'm only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.

I came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.

Reason we slept in the living-room is because I didn't want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn't ""fun camping"" or a ""picnic"".

This morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.

I went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

I'm not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

Oh, and if you can read this, I've deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.

AITA for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job?,"Not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. I got called an asshole for it, so now I have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

I met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. Two nights ago was our third date and I was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. Nothing fancy, I just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. This girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. She's funny, charming, and smart. We had had several great dates and I was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. She is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

Our waitress for dinner was great. Actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. At one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

At the end of the meal, she brought the check and I told her I would like to speak with her manager. She asked if there was something wrong, and I calmly repeated that I would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. She leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and I proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. He thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

The only one not happy was my date. She said, ""If that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that I was full of myself. She didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. I texted her saying I was sorry for whatever I did wrong and that I'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

TIFU by using the FaceApp everyone's been raving about,"So I guess this is a bit of a change from your normal TIFU posts but I felt like sharing anyways.

So this just happened like an hour ago. I'm sure you all have heard about the ""revamping"" of the FaceApp where you can literally age a photo of yourself. For those who don't know what I'm talking about, [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/faceapp-old-age-face-photographic-filter-mobile-app-development-russia/) is a good reference for you.

Anyways, so I saw someone post a picture to their Instagram and that's how I heard about it. I knew I had to download it and try it out...because why not?

So I download the app, take a picture and set the filter. 

And OMG I'm totally old lol. It's kinda crazy, and I'm not gonna lie...I look good as an old dude.

I decided to send the results with the original picture  to some friends and family who just die laughing at the filtered image. We start comparing pics and wonder if that's how we will really look in the years to come.

Then a thought pops into my head...

Everyone tells me I look just like my dad, and if that's true maybe he will get a kick out of this photo too! So I send it away!

...Nope.

He isn't excited, and he isn't laughing. He said it freaks him out.

I asked him why, and assured him it's just a harmless filter.

What he said next broke my heart.

""I know I'll never see you that old.""

TL;DR: I used the crazed FaceApp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. Fuck.

Am I a loser for being a virgin at 27 years old?,"I was born in Vietnam and moved to the US when I was 23. I had some girls interested in me during college (in Vietnam) but we never made a move because you know, it's Vietnam and it's the cultural thing back then. Then I moved to the US. Haven't found anyone since. There's so few asian in my city let alone Vietnamese. My college is full of white and latins (demographics). Don't get me wrong I don't mind dating out of my race but college folks here seem to keep to themselves, even men. I made some friends but as soon as semester ends they all go their own path. Some even deleted my number and ignored me. And it seems like all women are taken. In the end maybe it's because I'm not good looking (short, dark skin, average looking face). I also have moderate depression & anxiety. 


Then people made fun of me when they knew I'm a virgin. Even my relatives laughed behind my back too.

I made a post in a tech subreddit. Not only people didn't answer my question, but also they stalked my profile and made fun of me being a virgin. 

I know it might not be a big deal. But I felt so down after that. I felt like I should commit a suicide for being a useless loser in this world... 

Do I have hobbies? Yes, but most of them don't involve interactions with people. I keep a big fish tank and I love them. I play video games too. I've been rescuing stray dogs since I moved here. I used to volunteer at my local shelter but since I adopted my dog here and got busy with school I volunteer much less nowadays...

"AITA for not letting a family member I barely know drive my expensive car in an ""emergency""?","I was at my in law's house yesterday, alone with their god daughter (we'll call her Ashley, she's 28), while my husband was out doing stuff with his parents to discuss important family matters. I was already feeling pretty stressed and anxious about how their conversation was going to go. I don't really have a great relationship with Ashley, so I was just keeping to myself in one of the guest rooms on my laptop with a large glass of wine. About an hour later she comes in, panicked, asking if she can borrow my car. Apparently, her high school aged sister got in a really bad fight with their extremely dysfunctional father and needed to be picked up.

My car is a new Mercedes that cost me around 80 grand. I absolutely did not want her taking my car, especially somewhere that was almost an hour away. I asked her if their dad got physical with her sister in this fight and she said no. So, I told her I would rather her wait until my in laws got back and see if she could take their car. 

She starts yelling at me that they probably won't be back for a few hours and she needs to get her sister ASAP. I told her that unless she believes her sister's safety is at risk, I don't feel comfortable with her taking my car. She asked if I could drive her to get her and I told her I had too much wine to drive. She then proceeds to shit on me for being ""irresponsible"" for drinking and not anticipating I might have to drive, as well as ""selfish"" for not letting her take my car.

When they get back, she asks to take their car and makes a huge deal about how I wouldn't let her take mine. She goes on about how my ""fancy car is more important than a child in crisis"". I told them she said the girl wasn't in any danger and she tells me to fuck off before she gets in their car to leave. 

My in laws said she's just being an overprotective big sister and not to worry about it. When my husband was driving us home he told me I made the right call because Ashley is a very reckless driver, and totalled a car a couple years ago after driving too fast. However, the next morning my in laws text me that Ashley was incredibly upset and I should have just let her take my car. 

So, am I the asshole here? Like I said, she told me the kid wasn't in any danger. I feel like I'm being shat on for having boundaries. Am I off base?",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by cleaning my humidifier and almost killing my entire family,"Obligatory - This actually did happen today.

My family and I live in the sun-blasted hellscape that is central Arizona, USA.  The whole area is a hot, dry desert, and if you live outside of the city (as we do) it's common to see relative humidity in the teens, and single digits are not uncommon.  For those who don't live somewhere that's anathema to life, that's very dry.  Since we aren't a family of kangaroo rats, we keep the air in our house comfortable with an evaporative humidifier.  Basically, a pump drips water on an absorbent pad, and a fan pulls air through that pad to blow out more humid air to the house.  It's one of the full household-sized jobs that will humidify your air with twelve gallons of water a day.

For various reasons not apropos to this TIFU, the humidifier hadn't been maintained well for the last few weeks.  Today I decided to change the filter and give it a good cleaning.  Possibly inspired by another recent TIFU, I also decided to attack the calcium buildup with a 1/3 vinegar solution.  While cleaning, though, I noticed a sliminess that made me think that there was bacterial growth.  ""No big deal,"" thought I.  Eventually a biofilm will grow on something that's always wet, no matter what precautions you take.  I scrubbed off the biofilm, cleaned the calcium scale with my vinegar solution, and reassembled the unit.

Here's where the TIFU really starts.  Some parts of the mechanism aren't accessible - they are in the pump, water lines, etc.  I decided to run my vinegar solution though for a few minutes to dissolve some calcium deposits in places I couldn't reach.  ""But,"" thought I, proving that too much thinking causes trouble, ""there's probably bacteria in there, too.""  I figured I should add something that would kill the bacteria and what, I figured, is better at that than bleach?

Right now, readers with some chemistry are thinking, ""Uh, dude..."" Yeah, I know.  Or, I should have known.  But I didn't think it through, so I poured some bleach into the humidifier, followed by the remains of my vinegar solution, and turned it on to pump the mixture into the water lines.  Almost immediately thereafter, I took a whiff and started coughing.  At that point the little voice that remembered my college chemistry finally was heard.  Turns out mixing a sodium hypochlorite solution (like, say, bleach) with a weak acid (like, say, vinegar) creates chlorine and chloramine gasses, both of which are very toxic - like, they have been used as actual chemical weapons toxic, and I'd just put them in a goddamn distribution system.

I immediately unplugged the humidifier and carried it to the bathroom, turned on the vent fan, and poured my ersatz chemical weapon down the bathtub drain.  Of course, the pouring process gave me another good snoot of the offending vapors.  So now the house is airing out, the wife, son, and dog are playing in the backyard for a bit, the wife is trying to mail back my engineering degree, and for the next few days I'll be coughing like I've got the black lung, Pa.

TL;DR - Tried to clean my humidifier, accidentally tried to kill my family trench warfare style.

EDIT - Words

EDIT 2 - Front page, neat.  It has been pointed out that there wouldn't be chloramine, just chlorine - I think this story shows that chemistry isn't my forte.  Finally, to those giving me shit for making sure to mention that I'm an engineer, I have to - if everyone doesn't know, I'm just some guy with a lot of student loan debt.  Can't have that.

"TIFU my whole life. My regrets as a 46 year old, and advice to others at a crossroad","TIFU. More like more whole life really.

Hi, I my name's John. I've been lurking for a while, but I've finally made an account to post this. I need to get my life off my chest.  About me. I'm a 46 year old banker and I have been living my whole life the opposite of how I wanted. All my dreams, my passion, gone. In a steady 9-7 job. 6 days a week. For 26 years. I repeatedly chose the safe path for everything, which eventually changed who I was.

Today I found out my wife has been cheating on me for the last 10 years. My son feels nothing for me. I realised I missed my father's funeral FOR NOTHING. I didn't complete my novel, travelling the world, helping the homeless. All these things I thought I knew to be a certainty about myself when i was in my late teens and early twenties. If my younger self had met me today, I would have punched myself in the face. I'll get to how those dreams were crushed soon.

Let's start with a description of me when I was 20. It seemed only yesterday when I was sure I was going to change the world. People loved me, and I loved people. I was innovative, creative, spontaneous, risk-taking and great with people. I had two dreams. The first, was writing a utopic/dystopic book. The second, was travelling the world and helping the poor and homeless.
I had been dating my wife for four years by then. Young love. She loved my spontaneity, my energy, my ability to make people laugh and feel loved. I knew my book was going to change the world. I would show the perspective of the 'bad' and the 'twisted', showing my viewers that everybody thinks differently, that people never think what the do is wrong. I was 70 pages through when i was 20. I am still 70 pages in, at 46. By 20, I had backpacking around New Zealand and the Phillipines. I planned to do all of Asia, then Europe, then America (I live in Australia by the way). To date, I have only been to New Zealand and the Phillipines.

Now, we get to where it all went wrong. My biggest regrets. I was 20. I was the only child. I needed to be stable. I needed to take that graduate job, which would dictate my whole life. To devote my entire life in a 9-7 job. What was I thinking? How could I live, when the job was my life? After coming home, I would eat dinner, prepare my work for the following day, and sleep at 10pm, to wake up at 6am the following day. God, I can't remember the last time I've made love to my wife.

Yesterday, my wife admitted to cheating on me for the last 10 years. 10 years. That seems like a long time, but i can't comprehend it. It doesn't even hurt. She says it's because I've changed. I'm not the person I was. What have I been doing in the last 10 years? Outside of work, I really can't say anything. Not being a proper husband. Not being ME. Who am I? What happened to me? I didn't even ask for a divorce, or yell at her, or cry. I felt NOTHING. Now I can feel a tear as I write this. But not because my wife has been cheating on me, but because I am now realising I have been dying inside. What happened to that fun-loving, risk-taking, energetic person that was me, hungering to change the world? I remember being asked on a date by the most popular girl in the school, but declining her for my now-wife. God, I was really popular with the girls in high school. In university/college too. But i stayed loyal. I didn't explore. I studied everyday. 

Remember all that backpacking and book-writing I told you about? That was all in the first few years of college. I worked part-time and splurged all that I had earned. Now, I save every penny. I don't remember a time I spend anything on anything fun. On anything for myself. What do I even want now?

My father passed ten years ago. I remember getting calls from mom, telling me he was getting sicker and sicker. I was getting busier and busier, on the verge of a big promotion. I kept putting my visit off, hoping in my mind he would hold on. He died, and I got my promotion. I haven't seen him in 15 years. When he died, I told myself it didn't matter what I didn't see him. Being an atheist, I rationalized that being dead, it wouldn't matter anyway. WHAT WAS I THINKING? Rationalizing everything, making excuses to put things off. Excuses. Procrastination. It all leads to one thing, nothing. I rationalized that financial security was the most important thing. I now know, that it definitely is not.
I regret doing nothing with my energy, when I had it. My passions. My youth. I regret letting my job take over my life. I regret being an awful husband, a money-making machine. I regret not finishing my novel, not travelling the world. Not being emotionally there for my son. Being a damn emotionless wallet.

If you're reading this, and you have a whole life ahead of you, please. Don't procrastinate. Don't leave your dreams for later. Relish in your energy, your passions. Don't stay on the internet with all your spare time (unless your passion needs it). Please, do something with your life while your young. DO NOT settle down at 20. DO NOT forget your friends, your family. Yourself. Do NOT waste your life. Your ambitions. Like I did mine. Do not be like me.

Sorry for the long post, just had to get it out there.

TL:DR I realised I let procrastination and money stop me from pursuing my passions when I was younger, and now I am dead inside, old and tired.





Edit: I am quite overwhelmed at the response, thank you for your time. I had posted on a whim, and did not expect the reception.

In regards to my post, I must admit I was quite emotional at the time. As I read what I had written earlier, I can't stop myself from noticing an abundance of spelling and grammatical mistakes, phrases that I would not usually say. I don't think I have used Capital Locks so much in my life. 
However I will not edit them. That would not do it justice.

I have read many of the replies and will try my best to answer the reoccurring questions. I will add that the replies have given me a new perspective of life, Reddit and humanity in general. The amount of encouragement and humour persists to amaze me. Despite my situation, I even found myself laughing at a few of the comments.

What my plans are.
I am planning to cut down my hours substantially. I will take a new job if I have to, as I am relatively well-off. I am going to talk to my wife. Divorce is currently not what I have in mind and I hope that our communication and relationship will improve. If it doesn't, then so be it. We will both move on. I see there are quite a number of negative comments about her, however I am going to have to say in her defence, she really is a lovely person. She is smart, empathetic and has a great sense of humour. I'm not saying it was okay for her to do what she did, but she's not an evil person. I know that. We were both in the fault. We let communication dwindle, and with it, our relationship. There is so much more to being a head of house than just being able to bring in the money. A steady balance of emotional connection, love and finance is what I will strive to give.

My son. I don't any anything about him. I really don't. I have unknowingly distanced myself from him; I only see him around dinner time. I do not recall having a proper conversation with him, it's quite preposterous now that I think about it. I'm not exactly sure how I'll start bonding with him, I have become quite a boring person. However, I plan to change that. I refuse to be a poor role model. I will ensure that he does not make the same mistake I did with my family. I have decided I am going to start watching his basketball games and rugby games on Saturdays. I never have, due to work, but I will ensure that I do. Perhaps I will even play video games with him. There was a time I had a collection of SNES games, and I wasn't half bad either. Who knows, I might really connect with my son, and it seems to be something he enjoys.

In regards to the novel and travelling, I admit, I am a different person from my youth. I no longer have the creativity and desire to complete the novel. When I found the long-forgotten 70 pages, the writing was no longer mine. I have changed substantially in 26 years. I am sorry to disappoint as so many of you seemed incredibly keen to read it. However, I am just as excited to read the stories of all of you aspiring writers that have expressed their passion!
The travelling, I might still do. Family trips probably, in the school holidays. Maybe with my wife every now and then, if she'd have me. 

I can't turn back time and see my father for a final time, though my mother is still alive. She lives in London, so visits are quite difficult. However, I will make an effort to see her. I do love my parents. I only wish I had not prioritised them as I did.

In regards to the advice I have given. I stand by what I said. Live your life. Do not procrastinate and let lethargy stop you. However, I might add, avoid living in poverty. I have had the good fortune to have had never experienced hunger or homelessness. I would imagine chasing your ambitions and being happy would be considerable more difficult without proper nutrition and living standards! I believe someone mentioned their dream was financial stability. I say, that is just as valiant as any dream to have. We are all different and are missing different things in our lives, be honest with yourself and you'll know what you really want.
I believe there were arguments upon my language and university/college or what not. I will clarify that, although Australians generally call tertiary education 'university' here, I have made small efforts to pertain to Americans, as they are the main users, at least I assume. And yes, university/college was free when I attended. I believe Australians now are able to attend them relatively free (upfront) and can pay their fees after they graduate.

I believe I have covered the general scope of questions. 

P.S. Thank you for the gold, I do appreciate it, but they aren't of real value to me. Perhaps if Reddit ever includes a re-gifting gold feature, I will gift them to some of the commenters. And yes, please stop sending me gold! I also believe someone tried to even donate to me? I assure you, money is not what I read. Please save it for yourself!

I don't think I'll come back to Reddit, unless i hear about a way to re-gift gold. I thank you all for your sympathy, your time, and I wish all the best for those in difficult situations. I have faith in your capacity and ability to change, to become happy, to help yourselves. Because after all, you're the person in the best position to.
And no, I am not considering religion, I just do not have the correct mindset. I am logical to the point that I cannot, however that is not to say religion isn't bad, it gives people the hope and sense after death which I really do envy.

Sincerest of Regards,

John.

LPT: There is a visible difference between not working out at all and doing 15 pushups every day. Make 15 push ups your new 'not working out'.,"If you do not work out, do 15 pushups every day. It does not sound like much but it makes a huge long term difference to not working out. It does not take long and it makes a visible difference. 
If you struggle with 15, do 10. If 15 make you smile do 20.

Edit: Because of people messaging/commenting about injury and muscle imbalance: This is not meant to replace your workout routine nor is it meant to be your goto routine for the next 5 years.  
The LPT is meant to be: Even a tiny workout can go a long way. Warm up. Mix it up. But don't think working out only works if you spend 3 days a week in the gym. There is a wide gap between not working out at all and doing 5-10 minutes every day. You can see that difference and you can feel it.

My first instinct was to check the traffic lights at the moment of the crash so I could clearly tell who was at fault. My wife and I hung around the scene of the accident (no serious injuries thankfully) and gave our report to the traffic officer who responded. We felt good about ourselves for sticking around and doing our civic duty and figured that was that.

AITA For purposely stopping my classmate from winning an award and subsequently making her cry?,"This issue is honestly making me frustrated. Almost everyone is saying I am in the wrong, people are talking behind my back and I genuinely don't know if what I did was correct or not. I just feel so lost. Please, please do help.

I am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when I was 13. I have 2 really deep,long facial scars. I have been bullied really bad because of it. I am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. People make fun of other people by saying things like ""Why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" I am honestly used to it. Those people didn't matter to me anyway.

But there is this girl I had known since middle school. Let's call her Back I guess? Sorry, I honestly don't know how this works. I had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. I thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. My family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. I can play a guitar so I made this whole song for her. I went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. This was the first time I felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and I felt that regardless of what I do, she shall see me for who I am and at least accept me as a friend.

I was over the moon when she ended up accepting. We went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. She was really sweet to me. The next week or so was honestly heaven. People started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, I honestly cried everyday because I felt so fortunate to get so much love.
It all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on Instagram and followed Beck, sent screenshots to me. I honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

She had posts saying 'Fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his Valentine's"", 'Making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. Beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of March, and then distance themselves from me. She apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.And thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since I was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

I was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. My blood was boiling. I researched about this award, found a Facebook page about it online.I went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

She is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. I am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly I have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


Edit: I am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. Each comment means the world to me. I am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. No one besides my family has said these things to me. I know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. From the bottom of my heart,thank you.

Edit 2: Honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. I promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. Thank you for the gold.Thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. I honestly have gone through as many as I can and I just feel really fortunate and grateful.

I sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. Thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

Edit 3: I am sorry for boring you with all these edits. I geniunely can't thank you guys enough. I showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. I am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

BUT, I have been noticing a worrying number of DMs saying me I could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

I am not this kind of person and I hope nobody is. I have my own integrity. It's NOT right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. A couple of other DMs sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. It's honestly horrifying. I am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. I just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

I thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. A lot of women ARE amazing. My mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and I am sure many women out there are amazing.  Please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. Because I am not going to do that, ever. Please don't say all women are manipulative etc.

TIFU by smashing some girls teeth as a first impression.,"Edit: Just for a bit of clarity on the situation. I offered to pay as much as I could and she kindly said no it's all good.

I should have been more specific, her two front teeth were both really badly chipped to the point that you could barely see the base of the teeth there.

She's upset about the whole thing but has a very positive outlook on it, I've offered to help cover payments but she has politely declined.



This just happened a couple hours ago. Just a bit of context to start out. 

I'm moving into a flat with some great people in a couple of months and they invited me around for a few drinks as it was one of their birthdays. It was a bunch of about 20 of us and it was kind of a who knows who type situation.

It was a great time, everyone was getting along well, quite a few drinks, dancing, the usual stuff. Met this girl called Jess (not real name) and we got talking and she had the most amazing teeth and smile I've probably ever seen. 

Fast forward a couple of hours and we are all heading home, I'm pretty bad with women so classic me I don't make a move and just start walking home. It's about a 20 minute walk across town so nothing too bad but not ideal.

We leave at the same time and we find out we can kind of walk halfway home and split ways there. We're stumbling along with some playful banter and she jokingly tries to trip me up, I'm drunk but not that bad so I manage not to slam the concrete.
In return I jokingly trip her up and here's the TIFU. She falls like a 20 metre tall tree straight as a pole and slams the concrete. I feel so bad and instantly picked her up, she has a bloody nose and I'm freaking out because I've just slammed this Gorgeous girl into the ground.

She gets up, asks is her face okay and as she says it, I see her two front teeth are BOTH missing. My heart sank. I felt terrible. Never felt so bad in my life. I let her know the situation and she bursts out crying. 

I call an ambulance and we got to A&E where we sit for 4 hours waiting to be seen to be eventually told go home and go to the dentist tomorrow. In the 4 hours we did get to know each other relatively well considering the situation. I had a mixture of feeling terrible but also how the fuck does this happen. You only ever hear of these stories

I pay for the taxis home as it's the least I can do and take her in and she invited me in for a tea with her face still fucked up. We chat for a couple hours about random stuff and as I leave I say it'd be cool to hang out sometime and she actually agrees to it once but once her face is in better shape 

TLDR: Went to drinks, tripped up attractive Lady. Went to A&E got to know each other really well. Now who knows what'll happen",tifu

My [29m] girlfriend [24f] tried to throw me under the bus when the police searched my house,"First I'd like to start with some background. My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for a bit over a year. She stays at my house about 75% of the time. We have had no major problems before this point.

On Saturday night, we were watching TV in the living room, and suddenly there was loud pounding and shouting at the front door. My immediate reaction was to call the police, but after a look out the curtains, I found that it was the police.

At this point I was extremely confused. I don't sell, manufacture, or use drugs. I have no firearms in the house. I do nothing illegal online; I don't even pirate Game of Thrones. I had no idea why they might have reason to be knocking on my door on a Saturday night.

I opened the door and they immediately asked for permission to search the premises. I asked why they would think that was necessary, and they wouldn't answer. In turn, I refused to give them permission. My girlfriend repeatedly said I should cooperate. I said no, and told them to show me a warrant if they want to enter the house. They then informed me that they had probable cause and were searching my place no matter what I thought about the situation, and that their asking was only a formality.

The first thing they did after entering my house was pull my girlfriend and I into separate rooms and begin questioning us. I kept demanding they show me a warrant, but apparently warrants aren't even a thing anymore because probable cause can be literally anything when your local PD is backwater and shitty enough. 

I refused to answer any questions. I told them I wanted a lawyer if I was under arrest. I repeated that I did not consent to any searches of my property and repeatedly asked what their probable cause was--that there was nothing readily apparent (thank you Breaking Bad), and that they had no right to strip me of my privacy. 

My girlfriend, on the other hand, talked a lot. I didn't hear much because she was in the next room but I overheard her say this:

>You should check the back yard shed! I've never been in there before and I can't say what's in it...

At the time I could only think ""what the fuck is she doing?"" Well, the police checked the shed, and found nothing (again, I'm not a criminal), and an hour + hundreds of questions later left. At that point I asked why in the world she would try to help them find criminal activity in my house, and she could only answer that she panicked and didn't know what to do.

I don't need legal advice. My mother is a paralegal and knows a lot of good attorneys. She's furious about the police conduct, and she doesn't even know what my girlfriend said to them yet. I'm incredibly angry at my girlfriend for saying something so unbelievably moronic, but all she can respond to me with is ""I panicked and didn't know what to do."" What I need more than anything is another perspective on why a person would throw their S/O under the bus like that.

Does this seem like something that can be worked through, or is this just a huge red flag?

My [36M] wife [34F] has been having an affair with her own brother and I realised our son might not even be mine.,"I dont know how or where to begin. This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

‚Äã

My wife and her brother has always been messing around, they were the type of siblings to take joking a bit too far (sexually). New people who meet with them have always said that they are the type of siblings who you would think are married if it wasnt for them being brother and sister.

‚Äã

My brother in law lives very close to us. He is divorced and has 2 daughters who live with his ex-wife. My own wife very often takes over our son to his place, and also very often visits him herself. This is something I never ever had anything against, after all they are brother and sister. It wasnt until recently when my 4 year old son told me mommy and uncle tommy (lets call him that) had been kissing on the lips that I got suspicious. Apparently my wife had gotten angry at our son for no apparent reason for having seen this and she had told him grownups do this as a gesture of love.

‚Äã

Now, i understand hugging or kissing a sibling on the cheek but in my 36 years on this earth I dont recall kissing my own sister mouth to mouth. That is just...disgusting to me. Tonight I did something which I never done or felt the need to do before, and I checked my wifes phone only to find a load ton of messages between her and her own brother. Most of it is just regular chat, nothing special. But after having scrolled through a ton of messages I find sections of intimate pictures between them, and even messages such as ""horny"", ""want to come over for a quicky"" and similar sentences. I am grossed out by the sheer imagination of my wife having had sex with her own brother, as this cause me to imagine ever having kissed any of my own sisters which is disturbing to say the least.

‚Äã

Having sit here now thinking about what to do I cant do anything but to think my own son might not even be my own. So many times have I heard how ""he looks like uncle tommy"" and just looking at his face makes me believe this even more.

‚Äã

I am really at a loss at this point, I have no doubts about what she has done, but I cant imagine also having lost the only thing that meant more to me than my own life, my own blood, my son.

‚Äã

I feel like just jumping off a building or taking my own life if he ends up not being my child.

‚Äã

I want to divorce her, but I dont know how to go on about finding out whether I am the father or not, I really dont know what to do if I found out my son wasnt mine.

‚Äã

Edit: After reading several comments I decided it is best to not confront her now. My wife has been asking me multiple times what is wrong and I just told her I am not feeling well. I can barely look her in the eyes at this point. The only reason I am keeping it together is for my son. I wanted to go and sleep at a hotel but it would just raise too many questions on her part, so I will sit infront of the TV and sleep on the couch.

‚Äã

Edit 2: Had no idea this post would spiral out and get this many responses, thanks i guess. I wont be reading more PM's, I have gotten way too many of them.

Currently staying with my sister, I decided it was not a good time to confront my wife yesterday, so I just told her I will be moving in to stay with my sister for a few days as she needed help with some stuff. My sister lives about 30 minutes away from us. I have told everything to my sister and she thought it was best to meet with a lawyer. We scheduled a meeting today, he will be helping me with the divorce and has also offered to help me get a paternity test (read some comment about a guy who did a paternity and got the wrong result) which is why I will get it via a court.

I will be getting a divorce for sure, this is not something I will ever accept or can forgive. It's beyond f\*\*\*ed up. To the feminists out there who messaged me and told me to step up and forgive her, f\*\*\* you too.

I will confront her but I cant tell when, probably tomorrow. My sister wants to come with me, but I wont let her, I will head over there by myself and let her know what I found out, will see where it goes from there...

My(39m) daughter (16f) came out today and my wife(39f) cannot take it.,"This is very embarrassing to put up on my original account so please excuse me for posting from a new account.

We have been married for 17 years, together since high school. We have three children - a son and two daughters (17m,16f&12f). We all have an amazing relationship and we are super close with our children. 

Next week we are hosting a dinner for a special occasion. Everyone from our families is invited. My son's girlfriend is invited too.

So, yesterday my daughter (16f) wanted to talk to me and my wife privately. She basically told us that she was gay and we were the only people she confessed to. She wanted to invite her girlfriend over for the dinner. I must admit that I felt happy because my daughter chose to confide in us. The fact that she was comfortable talking to us about it made me proud. Somehow it made me feel like a good father. 

I reassured her that it was not something to be ashamed of and she would have our full support. This is when my wife exploded. She yelled at my daughter that she was 16 and she's just confused. She asked her she should date boys first because she can't claim to be gay without going out with boys. She also told her that no one in our families is gay( this isn't true and I'll elaborate on this later) and there was zero possibility of my daughter being one. She told her that she was not allowed to meet this girl and she didn't want freaks in her house. 

I was so angry at this point. My daughter was crying and apologizing for letting us down. I basically told my wife to keep her bigoted views to herself and took my daughter out for some alone time. I just reassured her that I would always support her every decision and be there for her and she could talk to me about anything. After we got home she went straight to bed. 

My wife didn't want to talk and told me that I loved my daughter more than her. She told me that she was the one who supported me through all my struggles and was always there for me. After that she just told me that she'd divorce me if I encouraged freaks. I was so taken aback by her behavior. This was totally out of character for her. 

Now, before painting my wife as homophobic, I think I know where this is coming from. Her brother came out to their family as gay. His parents supported his decision but he ended up taking his life because he was bullied. None of the children kniw about this and it was a very traumatic incident for her family. I asked her if thus was about her brother and she told me that he was nuts and refuses to talk to me.

How do I approach this. I want to be there for my daughter but I want my family. I want my wife to accept my daughter's choices. I feel like she just gave me an ultimatum. How do I make things better?

Edit1: Some of you have asked if this was the first time my wife expressed her views on homosexual people. No. We have friends who are gay and she was totally fine with them. 

Edit2:She loved her brother and was shaken by his death. I'm not privy to the exact details because no one in her family is comfortable discussing that but I know that he took his life because he was bullied. So my wife thinks that my daughter has to endure all this and she's upset. 

Edit3: And no. We are not doing any conversion therapy or anything like that. I will stand by my daughter alone if necessary.

TIFU accidentally watching a Black Mirror Episode with Audio Description on,"Not today, but Black Mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and I just remembered my fuck up. 

Said episode was ""Shut up and Dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. Because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

Now, I don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. So the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""Sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

Had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and I definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. But of course, the Black Mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

I think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. We were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

Well, the end was near, and came the twist. Normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. We were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? And to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

We were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as Black Mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. After some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  

Tl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.





Edit: mostly lurker, I don't know if there are any etiquettes I have to follow through, I will upvote everyone's comments for now.

We need to stop telling kids they can be whatever they want to be.,"Hold up, just hear me out. I'm not saying we should destroy the dreams of kids, but I'm absolutely in favor of not over-inflating a child's hopes to the point where they can't cope with any future failure.

We should be realistic with children from a very young age. Say things like, ""You can do so much"", ""The future has so many possibilities for you"", anything else besides the false promise of ""You can be literally anything you want to be""

I think it would help kids understand that while they have so much potential, there are some things they can't control.

"I[22m] like the girl[19f], but should I ask her if she's left something in her vagina?","So I started seeing this girl a little while ago and we moved things to the bedroom relatively quickly. We didn't do anything the first time we hung out as she was on her period, but the second time was a bit more active.

We'd gone back to her place and while I was laying down some finger work I swear I could feel something inside of her. Weird thought, I know, but it felt a bit cramped and like something artificial was there. There was a bit of an odor too, but I'd initially just put that down to iffy higene or something. So I was second guessing myself trying to work out if I'd imagined something inside this girls vagina. Part of me is saying it's ridiculous, but the other part is running through possibilities. What if its a tampon or something that's just been forgotten? 

The kicker is this girl says she's never masturbated, so I really don't know how often she'd get the chance to check. 

I feel paranoid and a little immature worrying about this, but I can't help but fret. Do I ask/tell her about it? Ignore it? I want to keep seeing this girl, but I have no idea how to even approach this issue. 

Any advice? 

Edit: I've sent her a message. Here's hoping she doesn't cancel our date later üëç

Edit2: She was very relieved I'd told her as I was right, she had forgotten a tampon. All is good now, thanks for the advice everyone!

Edit3: Date went well! Going to bed now, with her. Thanks again reddit! <3

Vanilla Ice Cream is superior to Chocolate Ice Cream.,"Disclaimer: Vanilla ice cream isn't my favorite, (that's cookie dough) but it's way better than chocolate.

First of all, the taste of vanilla ice cream is much smoother and relaxed than chocolate. Nowadays, everyone says ""chocolate's"" they're favorite candy or treat, but vanilla has a better taste.

If it's a hot summer day and I have the choice between chocolate ice cream and vanilla ice cream, I'm going to go with vanilla because it has a more refreshing taste than chocolate.

Vanilla ice cream is also the basis for a lot of other flavors, like cookie dough, cookies and cream, etc.",unpopularopinion
AITA for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed?,"Me (28M) and fiancee (27F) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. I also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

On Saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. I stayed with my parents but I left the dog with her because she likes having him there. However, *I made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on Sunday I get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. She was drunk, so I told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. When I got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. Two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. I felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

But then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. The girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

When we got home, I told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. I told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and I'll tell mine. She was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, I get bombarded by messages on Messenger, Whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that I am insane to do this to her after 4 years. They started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

The logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. Nope. They all fucking agree. My mom said: ""Well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" Lucky me, eh? My dog didn't fucking die!

My sister was appalled that I cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said I might have overreacted. Yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. But I am so disgusted at my fiancee that I can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. She isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

By the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. She likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar DANGEROUS things. It's not something I hold against her in the sense that I would ever mention in a fight, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. For example, my dog.

I'm 99% sure I will stand by my decision. But am I really an asshole? Literally nobody is on my side and I have no idea what to think.

&#x200B;

**Edit: Posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. She is negligent and irresponsible and I don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. I'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. If she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, I would also leave her. I guess I realized I don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",AmItheAsshole

UPDATE: My [34M] wife [28F] wants to name our baby after her dead ex-boyfriend,"[Original post](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bev4g9/my_34m_wife_28f_wants_to_name_our_baby_after_her/)

Hi all!

Wow - so, this post got a lot more traction than I expected. First of all, I want to thank all of you for your advices and showing your concerns not just for myself, but, for my wife. It means a lot.

Now, onto the update.

For Easter, we already had plans with her family to go to church and then have a BBQ at her sister's. Not wanting her family to see any tension, I saw this as a chance for her to HAVE to speak to me. As we're getting ready for church, I tell her that we need to talk about everything now. She agreed and sat down with me.

I did tell her that there is absolutely no way we're naming our baby after her ex (or, any of our kids, if we have even more). She agreed and apologized for acting irrational.

Also, I know a lot of you suggested that I get a paternity test. I know that I'm 100% the father. I didn't want anyone to get my anxiety up since, while it may seem rational, jumping into an extreme conclusion and making things worse. I thought it out, but, I still did ask if she was still in love with her ex and is she did cheat. She adamantly said no. She had already stopped loving him, even before they broke up. She tried to make the relationship work, but, she just wasn't in love with him anymore. She described him as not being a good person at all.

She apologized for making me feel that way.

I told her that I understand she's going through a lot of emotions right now and being pregnant doesn't help at all. But, I had to ask on why she would want to name our baby after him, even after all she has told me. 

She started to get choked up and was shaking. I told her that she could tell me. 

She confessed that when her and her ex broke up, the last thing she told him was that she wished he would fall off his bike and die. Also, the bike that he died riding on was a bike that she strongly suggested that he buy, even though it wasn't his first choice.

She also talked about how accidentally getting pregnant and her ex suddenly dying is a lot for her to handle. She wasn't expecting to be a mom so soon and her life is about to change when she really didn't want it too. She talked about how she thought we'd travel and that she'd continue racing her motorcycle. Now, she's not even sure if she'd be able to ride again. She actually thought she might be able to ride again once she had the baby, but, her ex's death reminded her how much of a risk it is. She doesn't want to risk her life when she has a family. She feels gutted. 

Regardless, she kept stressing out to me on how she wouldn't change a thing about her life now and that she's happy to be married to me and is going to be a mom. We're the best things that has ever happened to her.

Anxiety also runs in my wife's family. My wife gets intrusive thoughts about how her ex died too. It's so bad that she has a hard time sleeping sometimes. 

After discussing things, she decided that she'll be going into therapy.  She has her first appointment this week.

TLDR: Wife feels guilty about ex's death after persuading him to buy the motorcycle that he died on and telling him she wished that he'd fall off his bike and die. She keeps thinking about how he died. Wife also said that she's happy to be married and is going to be a mom, but, there's a lot going on and it's a lot. She's sad that she probably can't ride motorcycles anymore. Wife will go into therapy this week.",relationship_advice

My gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where I proposed.,"I decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. I flew her to Vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in Cambodia. She had wanted to see Angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. After a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together I proposed and she said yes. We kissed and I had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. It's really beautiful. She took a shower and I laid in bed thinking what an amazing day I just had and how I would get to spend the rest of my life with the women I loved. When she came out of the shower however she was in tears. She handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

I played it cool and said I understood but truthfully it hurt. It seems to me that I had offered her something of value. A lifelong commitment and partner. I took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. I felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. It was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. If she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. So she can't possibly value me or what I have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place I asked. 

I'm preparing to end things when we get back. She wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but I'm done. Am I wrong? Should I do it over? What do you think.

Any advice is appreciated.",relationship_advice

I was going to make this an edit but due to its length, I figured to make it a separate post. I don't even know if this is relevant to this subreddit anymore, but I sincerely apologize if I am in the wrong.

I just wanted to address some common questions, and to clear up some things I've mentioned in the comments briefly. I hope this post is a little more coherent and organized than my previous ones.

But before I do that, I want to thank everyone who sent me a DM, inboxed me, or commented, offering to talk or giving me advice. I've read through all of them, but I haven't gotten around to replying, but regardless, thank you so so soo much. You have no idea how much it actually means to me, and how much I appreciate it. I love you all <3

# Quick update:

I texted Kyle yesterday and he replied. I asked him how he was feeling. He said he was even more sick than earlier. I said I was too, and I said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). I told him about how I had a volunteer thing at University which I went to and how I nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. But that was it. We didn't talk about much else because he stopped responding.

In addition to this, I haven't called the number my TA gave me because they are only open Monday - Friday from 8am to 4pm. So, I'm going to be doing that on Monday, hopefully.

# My condition:

The exact name for my condition is Mayer-Rokitansky-K√ºster-Hauser Syndrome, or MRKH Syndrome for short. It affects 1 in every 5000 women. A lot of people, I'm assuming they were trolls, stated that I was a guy or something along those line. Just to clarify, I am a woman, I look like a woman physically and I've felt like a woman my whole life. I was genetically born with XX chromosomes. Being a woman is not something I doubt.

There are basically 2 types of branches within MRKH. Type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. Type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. This may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. I have type 1. There are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. I am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# Diagnosis:

A lot of people were confused as to why I was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did I find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

The way MKRH works is that it affects INTERNAL reproductive organs. This means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. From the outside, I look like a normal female. I have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. I am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. My ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why I am still physically able to look like a female. For me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, I have something called an indentation or 'dimple'. For 18 years of my life, I lived thinking I was just like any other girl. I never once suspected anything wrong.

When I started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. But this was around the time I started to feel like something was wrong. One main reason was that I hadn't started my period, and the second being the fact that I wasn't able to insert a finger inside my vagina. For some reason, at the time, I assumed periods and fingering went together. I thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina ""opened"" and the barrier fell out or something like that. Its weird looking back at that now haha.

I went to the doctors one day (this was before I started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. This is probably one of the most common ways women with MRKH find out about it. The doctors simply assumed that I was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. I was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. I was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. The following year, I got my shit together on my own. I joined the wrestling team, track team, and I started doing weight training. As a result of this, I was also eating way more, and I gained a lot of muscle mass. I got my weight up to 120lbs. when I still hadn't gotten my period, I went back to the doctors. They still didn't take it too seriously, telling me that some women don't get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. I had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. I didn't feel like everything was normal, so I switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. Needless to say, I was getting tired of blood tests because I knew they didn't show anything. One doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but I think that was circumstantial. Prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that I had breast discharge which is something I had NEVER experienced before in my life. Some how, I can't exactly remember which doctor, I ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to ""reset"" my biological functions and induce a period. I diligently took the BC pills every day. Nothing happened. This is when I thought, ""Is it just me or does healthcare in Canada suck?"".

Then another doctor suggested I get a pelvic ultrasound done. This is when they found the issue. The poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn't even exist. The doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. She stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom I had MRKH. She said according to the ultrasound I had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). She literally didn't even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. I walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. His response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and I could hear him. And then he said, ""its okay, just forget it"". I came home, and I did some googling and started to learn more about MRKH. I had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and I texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. I also added that if it changed anything between us, that I would understand, and I wouldn't hold it against him. As much as I might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something I really needed at the time.

After the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a SickKids Hospital in downtown Toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. They started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. They had me get an MRI done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an MRI. I also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). Doctors aren't allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. I ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because I didn't have one. The look on their face was hilarious as I'm sure they probably never heard of my condition either. After I met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, I was properly informed that I did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but I was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. I was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. They had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a Q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. The depth of it was about 3mm deep. It was actually quite painful, and I hated doctors by this point anyways.

# Family Situation:

My parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are HIGHLY taboo. Everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn't know English well so most of the time when I went to the doctors, I went with my dad. It was very weird and awkward. The few times my dad refused to go with me, I went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

After my last appointment with SickKids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. My dad took those from me and threw them out, saying I didn't need them. They also asked if I would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that I didn't it. Going to therapy at the Hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. I can't drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. Taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which I don't particularly mind doing if it helps me, but I don't have time due to school. I actually got a letter from the hospital in September about a pretty cool MRKH conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. I really really wanted to go. But again, it was far. I figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, I could definitely bus there. The event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. It was unrealistic for me to go. So then I told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. They'll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" I tried arguing that it was EXACTLY the opposite of that, and that they WANT to inform you that you ARE women despite the lack of certain organs. They responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) I had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

I had someone telling me that I need to stand up to my parents. My parents aren't the issue, but my dad is. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances that I don't particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something I refuse to do. I am well aware of the shitty situation I am in. I know they are being abusive, in more than one way. I've thought long and hard about it, and I've come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. I'm not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we're like a normal family. I've seriously taken everyone's well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# Surgery:

I had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. In my first post, somewhere in the comments, I believe I said something along the lines of ""Im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now"", as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why I can't get surgery yet. Lucky for me, I live in Canada and I have health insurance! Surgery is definitely an option for me. But due to my family situation, they believe that I wont need surgery until after I get married because I mean its not like I'm going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# Additional comments:

1. A lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that I could look into doing anal. It's all about personal preference, and I hate it. Its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. I can look into the asexual community, but I am NOT asexual. I may not be able to satisfy my needs, but I do have a pretty high sex drive, and I do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. I don't know if I would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. A lot of people had a lot to say about how I handled the situation. Some saying I did the right thing, and others saying I did it too soon. Honestly, I haven't figured out the right way to go about it. I have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. I once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""Aren't you surprised I still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" I was so taken aback by it, I didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. Someone said that ""If a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, I'm sure its an important part of their life but it's a huge first date turn off. So he shouldn't disclose it on the first date"". True, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his IBS. I didn't disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was RELEVANT to what was happening. I evaluated the situation I was in with Kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so I had to tell him. Agree or not, first date material or not, I'm going to stand by with what I did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. I am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. Its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest I do that, but you don't really know what its like until you're actually in the situation yourself. I don't want to publicly display it to guys I'm not interested in, nor to those who aren't interested in me. I know guys who also use those dating apps, and I don't want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. The guy I ended up calling on Tuesday night, after I left Kyle's apartment, he knows about my condition. He has told me that it wouldn't bother him. I had a lot of messages telling me that I shouldn't friend-zone him, and that I should give him a chance. Here is the real reason why I'm not attracted him nor why I would never ever give him a chance: He's basically doing nothing with his life. He's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. Whereas I on the other hand, I work part-time, I study my ass off in school, and I make time to do extra curricular stuff. I also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. But I treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. I'm not saying I'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am I saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. I'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and I'm not into that. In addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **""the other guy""**. He was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because ""he was lonely"". I was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, I am. There is no way I am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. I think one of the main reasons I even turned to reddit in the first place was because I am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. Social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and I don't want them finding out. There was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me I can't find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications I got.

This is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. I hope I answered some questions. I really do appreciate all the support I got. Thank you, and take care everyone <3

Edit: I'm only doing this to feel better about myself: Kyle replied. ""I definitely do not want to get involved"". Fuck you, Kyle. If y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. I welcome it with open arms. 

Edit: I think I forgot to address this earlier. For those of you asking whether I can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. My clitoris is underdeveloped. Stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. Maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? I don't know. I haven't tried.

I (F25) found out my fiance (M27) is with me for money/family business,"To preface. My family owns a business that is very well known in our sector and makes loads of profit. Thus I am a trustfund baby. I try to not be spoiled and have always worked myself.
I met my fiance Mark when I was 20 and working as a waitress.

We began dating a few moths later and he proposed to me last year.

Now mark is not poor. He is upper middle class. And while he doesn't struggle in life he didn't have to much to spend and lived very frugal. I thought he was an honest man because he always wanted to pay for his own things, reject expensive family holidays when we were still dating and he would cook for me instead of going with me dining outside. What I want to say is that I never had the impression that Mark was trying to take advantage of me or my family.

In the beginning my family was a little sketched out and brought up the  ""gold digger"" argument and I stood up for him and fought with my dad. They came to love and accept him. When Mark graduated Dad hired him and now he is in a high earning position.

Sunday I was supossed to work in the evening and I was going to stay with my sister. But I got a fever and was basically just non functioning so I stayed home. Instead of staying in our bedroom I made my way to the guestroom that is better ventilated, has a mini fridge and it's own bathroom (I didn't want to stand up at all and walk arround so I just bunkered all my stuff there and closed the door).

Mark came home when I was fast asleep and I was woken up by loud voices in our garden. I pushed the curtains a bit to the side and mark Was there with a few friends. Just as I wanted to say hello I noticed that they were talking about me.

His friend kept laughing and calling Mark ""the man!"". Then they started laughing about me being willing to not sign a prenub. Then one of the girls that was there said something along the lines of ""Jesus you about to make some bank mark!"". Mark laughed and said ""yeah just 3 more years and I am free"".

At this moment I felt sick to my stomach and wanted to throw up. I kept hearing them calling me trust fund Barbie and stupid and so on. I didn't know what to do so I just lied petrified in my bed and waited till the people left and mark went to bed. I texted my sister and snuck out to her place in the middle of the night and just passed out without telling her anything.

I haven't returned home and just told Mark that I was sick and didn't want to make him sick.y
My sister has been really worried but I just feel so ashamed about everything. My family was right mark is a gold digger and I fell for it. Even if I tell my family what happened I have no proof. My father can't fire him just because he is a dick. As far as I know he is  excellent at what he does and he has no legal foot to fire him I think. I just feel so confused ashamed and angry and would appriceate some insight

Edit : we are non us. Mark wasnt talking about anything else. He has no debt as he partly was under a scholarship and with part of it I helped pay it off. There is no way he wasn't talking about me

Edit 2: thank you all for your great advice. I opened up to my sister about it and she is right now with me reading all your responses. We have called up dad and I will talk to him tommorow. I will be signing out for the time being thanks again.

Edit3: some questions have come up.

I don't drive that's why my fiance didn't see my car. I mostly uber arround

I worked as a waitress for the experience not for the money and I don't anylonger

I don't work for my father I am a company shareholder and I have to go to the general Quartal meetings but I don't work for him.

I am sure that it wasn't a fever dream. It was arround 38.5c and while it was enough for my body to hurt it wasn't enough to have a vivid dream. By pass out at my sisters o don'team literall medically passing out.

Last edit : I am really tired that you guys are defending him saying that it could have been a joke. Guess what. It's not fucking funny. You don't degrade and disrespect your partner for laughs. You don't go along calling them stupid, trustfund barbie, stupid bitch and you definitely don't make remarks yourself. I don't understand that macho bravado as many of you have called it, but I don't think that's okay so stop with those comments. It was deeply hurt full.",relationship_advice

My girlfriend told me this joke ten years ago. We've been married nine years today.," A penguin is driving to the mall when all of a sudden his engine starts running really rough, and smoke is coming from under the hood.  Luckily, there's an auto repair shop right next to the mall, so he pulls in there.  The mechanic says he'll be glad to take a look, but he won't be able to get to it for a couple hours.  The penguin says fine, and walks across the street to the mall.

He kills time walking around the mall, does some window shopping, buys an ice cream cone, etc.  Finally the two hours are up and he goes back to the mechanic.

The penguin says, ""Have you had time to look at my engine?""

The mechanic says, ""Yeah, it looks like you blew a seal.""

The penguin says, ""No, that's just ice cream.""

My (18f) parents are disowned me and kicked me out because I accidentally got pregnant,"Edit: Sorry for that glaring typo in the title.

This entire situation blew up so fast in my face that I'm still reeling.

I should probably preface this by saying that my parents are extremely strict Asian immigrant parents. It's always been education and academics before love and support. I grew up being physically beat for getting a single ""B"" grade on my report card and having to give my mother my passwords to all of my accounts. Nevertheless, I obeyed their every command. I graduated just last week in the top 10% of my class and am going to Brown University on an almost full-ride (more on that later in regards to the current situation) this fall. 

Following my college acceptances, I probably breathed the biggest sigh of relief in my entire life. My parents finally had nothing to complain about since I fulfilled their biggest dream for me: ""to get into an Ivy League school."" All was good for about a month. My parents finally stopped reading my text messages, tracking my every move, etc. I was free to go out with friends, spend time with my *secret* boyfriend, and just enjoy being a high schooler. 

My boyfriend and I have been together since last summer, so almost a year now. My parents had their suspicions about us in the beginning but I brushed it off and faked my way into making them believe he was just a friend. But after I committed to Brown and they seemed happy enough, I became more lax about hanging out with him and I think they figured it out. 

We started being sexually active in December but have always been incredibly careful about using protection. The only time where I'm not 100% sure we were careful was during spring break when we went to Mexico with a couple of our friends and got drunk and had sex. It would make a lot of sense if that's when it happened. Now, I fully understand that we were both stupid and should have exercised a lot more caution. It's our fault completely and I'm not saying otherwise.

Fast-forward to about a week ago. I'm starting to get weird period-like symptoms, but no period. At that point, I honestly just knew. It was like this weird gut feeling and I freaked the fuck out. My boyfriend was incredibly supportive and drove me over to his house where he'd already gotten tests and had me take two of the pretty expensive ones. All positive. I broke down and cried for hours. 

When I got home, I was still visibly upset despite trying my best to hide it. But I wasn't acting carefully or thinking rationally because of everything that happened. I spoke to him explicitly about the situation over a messaging app that my mom has my password to. In retrospect, she definitely suspected that something happened between me and him (probably a break-up) so she logged on to read our messages. 

The very next day, I wake up to the sound of my mom lugging all of my stuff out of my room and throwing it onto our lawn. I get up and ask what the fuck she's doing and she's crying and calling me the nastiest stuff in Chinese like, ""You're a whore, just kill yourself,"" or, ""I should have gave you up for adoption you useless piece of shit."" And other completely ridiculous things like, ""Now you're a prostitute and no longer a virgin, no good boy will ever want to marry you now."" 

I was begging her to stop but the more I did the angrier she got. She was breaking the majority of my stuff, tearing up my work/papers, smashing my photographs, etc. All I could to was call my boyfriend and have him pick me up. 

It's been three days since that happened. I've picked up all of my stuff, at least the stuff that isn't irreparably damaged. My mother or father is not returning any of my calls but continuously sends me brutal text messages about how much of a failure and disappointment I am and how I turned into a prostitute. She also communicated that she will no longer be paying for my education at Brown and that I will never be allowed to call her my mother and have any interaction with her. My yearly tuition not including personal expenses is around $15,000. I have about $10,000 in my own personal checking account from just working a few jobs throughout high school. However, that's not counting the birthday money I've received and the money that my grandfather left me when he passed. Those are in a separate account being controlled by my mother. There's about $75,000 in there and I have no idea how I'm going to get it back.

I'm currently living with my boyfriend. His parents are at a complete loss as to why my parents are behaving this way and I am so ashamed. They've been nothing but supportive of us, even going as far as to offer to pay for whatever choice I end up making about the baby. We've both decided that I'll get an abortion and he's currently working on figuring all of that out while I'm still worrying about my entire fucking future. 

I don't know why but I just feel so incredibly alone at this moment despite having my boyfriend and his family. I can't my best friends because I don't want this to spread and I obviously have no familial support. I'm just so lost. What should I even do at this point? 

TL;DR: Strict Asian parents disowned me and kicked me out of the house after snooping and finding out I was pregnant. They've cut off all contact and refuses to pay for my college tuition. I fully plan on attending Brown this fall after getting the abortion, but I have no money. I'm at a complete loss as to what to do. Any advice appreciated.",relationship_advice

"[Austin, TX] Apartment maintenance workers walked in unannounced on my naked girlfriend, just moments after watching me leave for class, then take their time leaving. They've been watching her for months.","The maintenance workers in our apartment complex have always lingered outside our door since we moved in back in September of last year. We've had a few tickets put in for minor repairs on some appliances, and the first two times they came, they always knocked because the deadbolt was locked, even though they tried to enter without any prior notification. She noticed, as I'm usually oblivious to things of that nature, that they've been spying on her, like walking by frequently to try to see through her blinds, among other things such as minor cat calls.

She feels like maybe it's her fault because she had a ticket in for repairs, but I feel like this is predatory behavior, and that no maintenance worker should legally be able to enter someone's home unannounced, and that the main office should send and email with an estimate on the time frame in which the repairs would take place.

TIFU By Revealing That I Had Secretly Hid In My Roomate's Closet During His Pre-Bedtime Ritual,"Obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.

I lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we'll call them Ned and Ethan. The three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. The most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out Adam Sandler's At a Medium Pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (Everyone thinks they're hilarious in college, I know).
The most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. But one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in Ned's bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of Adam Sandler on my shitty Washburn 6-string. 

Trying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but Ned was no random college student. Ned was the 6'3"" milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. Ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. Ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. In short, Ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. So to me, that meant that whenever Ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.

So I grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he'd think I had went to bed early), and snuck into Ned's bedroom to position myself in his closet. It was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, [like this](https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/UC2H/HMVJA37Y/FYAUC2HHMVJA37Y.MEDIUM.jpg). Ned's bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so I'd have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and Ned, in case I accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. But directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was Ned's computer and desk. 
Ned came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. Due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, I could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. The 12 inch proximity of Ned spiked my adrenaline, and I began to control my breathing. My back was pressed against coat hangers, and I had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. Ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and I had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. ([Artist depiction](https://i.imgur.com/XmLM5Bh.png))

As Ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. Ned did not reach for his glass of water. Ned did not opt for the pajamas. Ned did not leave his desk. Ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.

A million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. If I make myself known now, he'd be immensely embarrassed and angry that I had just violated his privacy. But if I *didn't* speak up now, chances are I'd have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. So I was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while Ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. It felt like I was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.

My hands began to cramp as I awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn't generate an ounce of noise. My legs began to jitter as I compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. Seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as I waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell I was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.

After Ned's satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a Kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that I had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.

Ned promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and I had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. All critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until I remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. But with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would I get the phone out my pocket? Somehow I did, and I texted Ethan in the next room over:

> foogama: In Ned's closet. Was trying to do Medium Pace gag. Ned started wanking before I could start. Now I'm stuck in the closet and can't get out. Need help.
> 
> Ethan: LOL right.
> 
> foogama: Ethan, I'm dead serious. I need you to help create a distraction for Ned so that I can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.
> 
> Ethan: ‚Ä¶we're going to need to have a talk later.

Right around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). It was 10:45pm on a Thursday, but I could hear Ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **""HELLO? WHY YES NED IS HERE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? NED! NED COME HERE, PHONE FOR YOU!""** Ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. How this never raised suspicion, I'll never know. It was a cordless phone. There was no need for Ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. But thank god he did. I bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and Ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some ""stranger"" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.

I was forever in debt to Ethan for saving my ass, and we never told Ned. That is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in Ned's wedding. There was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we ""found interesting"" about Ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, I was convinced by Ethan to write ""That he enjoys anal sex with large black women"" because it would make a fun ""bachelor story"" over 10 years after the fact.

But of course that's not what happened. The best man decided it would be more fun to‚Äîwithout warning‚Äîswitch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we'd be reading the bride's, and they'd be reading Ned's. And of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. I didn't even know her name. I had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.

The bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. Ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. He immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. I immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. Ethan and I waited for Ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. We were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.

**tl;dr ‚Äì Hid in my roommate's closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride's best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**

I've since learned my lesson and just don't hide in peoples' bedrooms like an idiot.

  I called the number a while later to find that it belonged to the employee. He apologized and promised to delete the photos, but I am pretty upset that my privacy was violated.

Instagram is ruining everything (a rant),"I think that Instagram is one of the worst developments in modern culture. Let me explain:

1. **IG is the most shallow of all social media platforms**. While social media platforms like twitter and sometimes even Facebook politically engage people, allow them to connect and organise Instagram is solely based on one person and their looks/life/vacation. No political or important dialogue is happening. I would argue that even Pinterest is more worthwile since at least DIYs teach you something.
2. **IG is all fake but everyone pretends that it's real.** Why we are all pretty much aware from our own Instagram use that these images are usually not what our lives look like all instagram users apparently have this pact that they are just all going to believe each other's bullshit.
3. **IG is bad for your mental health.** Because unrealistic standards are set on Instagram but everyone just pretends like they're real people doing real things it feels like everybody's life is the way it looks in IG. This also creates feelings of inadequacy and is therefore detrimental to especially young people's mental health. (See also this article: [http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/](http://time.com/4793331/instagram-social-media-mental-health/)). I also think this applies equally to women and men since the unrealistic standards concerning looks and lifestyle are more than ever directed towards both genders while they previously were more directed towards women as in e.g. advertising.  Additionally, the dopamine rush people get from likes creates an almost addiction-like potential that makes them use the app more and more and making the mental health issues even more pronounced.
4. **IG makes people vain.** Taking pictures of yourself all day makes you the center of your own attention and that leads to ignoring other people and the actual experience you're documenting. It's not about where you went what you ate or what incredible experience you had but only what it looked like and what you looked like doing it. This makes everybody focus more and more on their own appearance and less about things that actually make you a successful human being.
5. **IG gives the worst incentives to people.** The reason I am ranting right now is that I saw a Vice video about a poppy field in California that is killed by people sitting and stepping on it to take pictures predominantly for Instagram (Video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxUrr-CIgkA)). They then talked to the people taking the pictures asking them why they're doing it and their answers made me incredibly angry. Some people were open about just wanting likes but some others pretended like they were really concerned about the flowers talking about ""the feeling of being one with nature"". So these people want to signal to others that they love nature and the beauty of it while literally destroying the natural habitat and the flowers. This shows that they really don't care about anything at all except their likes on a goddamn picture. Now I don't think that they are inherently bad people but I think that Instagram actively gives them an incentive to be this way fuelled by the addictive potential of the platform and the likes you get from it.

I would encourage anyone reading this to please examine how much time you spend on Instagram and if you get anything from it than a simple dopamine rush and feelings of inadequacy and think of what you could do that's more meaningful and actually makes you happy.

EDIT: A lot of people are posting that they follow artists, architects, blacksmiths etc. and use Instagram predominantly in a small community or niche. So just to clarify, I do think that one can use Instagram positively and get a lot of good content from it. What I wanted to point out in my post is the culture that evolved around instagram and especially individual people posting nothing but their lives. And while some of you are so blessed as to not experience this culture in your everyday lives I feel like for others the posting ""cute"" pictures of oneself is a crucial part of social life e.g. kids in middle/high school. I do think that every social media platform can be great since it really depends on the users and what they post. However, I feel that while some good Instagram accounts exist the majority is selfies, vacation and food pictures and that this makes some people feel that they to share this much of their lives as well.",unpopularopinion
TIFU by slapping my teachers ass,"So basically I was in class with one of my friends who takes the same subject, he was super energetic and always wearing semi-formal clothing.

This is in my relaxed electronics class where everyone moves around and is always chatting away. So, it's mufiday and look over at my friend who was leaning over a desk with his ass sticking out, while he was talking to another student. 

So I go up and with a huge wind up, slap his ass so hard that he immediately jumps up, as if he's just jumped out of his own skin. 

You see, the problem with that was that the person I slapped was not actually my friend... but our teacher. 

Everyone is at a stand still, waiting for my death penelty, especially my friend whose just staring my down at this point. Now the teacher's face goes bright red, and I'm starting to freak out thinking I'm doomed. 

Except, the teacher just sits down, looks me in the eyes and says, ""Hewy (not my real name but username will do). Save that for after class"" with a big grin on his face.

Everyone at this point bursts out laughing as I'm sitting here absolutely shitting my pants thinking I was about to get kicked out of school. 

God, I love my teach hahaha

TL;DR
I was having a good day in class, when I mistakingly slapped my teachers ass and get totally embarrassed by the comment he makes at the end of it.",tifu
Standing under the shower head and just turning it on is superior to just letting the water heat up.,"Whenever I take a shower in the morning, I have to stand under it and just turn it on. That way, you're slammed by the freezing water and it jumps you awake and then it slowly warms up and you can enjoy the hot water even more.

TIFU by swiping on my girlfriend's phone NSFW,"So this happened a few days ago and I'm still not sure I'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

I've been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She's perfect for me. We're perfect for eachother. We're getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

We went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

She went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. It's annoying as hell.

But some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

There she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I've ever seen in my life. I've watched porn - a lot. I've never seen a dick like this. I'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

I could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

I closed the pictures and I've acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

We haven't had sex since. I can't concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.

TL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed

Picked up son from daycare and he was crying alone on the ground with a dislocated elbow and indifferent adults.,"So, before I tell this story, I'm pretty sure since there's no significant damage here that this is moot, but everyone keeps telling me to sue, so here I am.
  
   
This is in Michigan 
   
   
My wife picked our 2 year old son up from daycare where she found him outside, on the ground and sobbing by himself. When she asked the teachers why he was there they said ""he wanted to be there"" because they tried to move him to the shade and he wouldn't go. He also can't move his arm. She tells me this and I call and speak to the director who says she'll talk to the teachers. She calls me back and said the new teachers didn't know him and he was upset when one of them picked him up from behind. I ask how this explains his immobile arm and she has no explanations and says its not fair to jump to conclusions about adults and I explain that I'm not concerned THAT it happened, but they have a duty to provide a safe environment for my son and they have absolutely no idea how he came to be injured. She has no response. I take him to the doctor, he gets 3 xrays before they conclude nursemaids elbow which he has had before and is common. Is there anything actionable or that I should do? I'm clearly not sending him back there, at least. Thank you for your time.",legaladvice

Boyfriend and I slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. Landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out,"This happened in Ontario, Canada.

So this past Friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

I found out about it the next night at work (I work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and I were the night before. He filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

For more context, on the 24th of October a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. It has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (I sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

All we asked for was the alarm for our unit. Luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

Boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

I dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. My dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. But I don't know. Came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in Ontario. 

EDIT: More direct questions; should we pursue action and report? If we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? I know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. I could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

TLDR: Boyfriend and I were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

"Telling men to not be afraid of a false rape accusation because it's statistically unlikely doesn't help anything, because that's not WHY we are really afraid.","Anyone who pays attention to the news, at all, should remember the cluster fuck that was the Kavanaugh hearings. Resulting from that mess was the brief conversation that happened around the interwebs, on the opinion pages of news sites, and probably a good amount of interpersonal conversations as well. 

The conversation went as such: If you're afraid of a false rape accusation landing on you, you're wrong to do so because it's so rare, and you're a shitty person to do so because that means you don't care about women. Furthermore, even men who *are* falsely accused of rape rarely see jail time anyways!

Yeah. No shit. The reason being is that the biggest way to determine if an accusation is false is if there is *undeniable evidence despite the accuser stating otherwise* (which is rare) **OR** *the accuser confesses that the accusation was false* (which is usually the case). So... of course the legal system will not give charges based on a *certifiable false statement.* 

What ISN'T outlined about rape accusations is the majority of them are closed because there is no evidence to support *either* scenario. The implication in providing the ""they're really rare"" statistic was it *implied the remaining allegations were true.* In effect, it was a lie by omission. 

And the above really isn't my point anyways. Here's the main point:

*In a false accusation, the false accuser is rarely punished. There are very little, if any, repercussions to a false female rape accuser if she's found to be lying.*

So, why should a woman be scared to make a false allegation if *his life is going to be fucked up from it and hers isn't, even if she's caught in the lie?* Where's the deterrent there? 

Another question that I have never once seen given a good answer:

How does a man prove verbal, unrecorded consent to sex? This is how *most* consent occurs anyways. Other than his word, what defense does he have to a woman stating that the sex turned into rape? Throw in radical feminism's insistence that consent can be revoked at any time, *even after sex*, then what men are looking at is a fucking legal minefield that has this as a sign at the front of it: Intimacy with a Woman. 

We have no defense, she gets no consequences..... and people are baffled as to why men, especially young men, are terrified of this? 

Lastly: I want to be wrong. 

Here's what you can do if I am: treat me as someone who has been lied to, and **prove why that's the case**, without being a piece of shit about it. try and see if you can avoid calling me an ""incel"" as that is the current insult in this regard I've found. 

I'm not saying this to guard against my delicate sensibilities, but rather know that I am *nowhere close* to being alone here. Relentless condescension, name-calling, and accusations are only going to do one thing with the growing number of men who are convinced they're right: it'll reinforce their position, and you won't even see them in the comments. You won't even see them outside the walls of a public conversation, or a heated exchange on Facebook. Talk to *them,* not *me...* in this case here on Reddit at least.  

So, if I am wrong, convince the people not leaving comments, the ones listening, that I am... and see if you can do it in a way that doesn't make *you* look like part of *another* growing demographic: someone who doesn't even give a shit and could care less about men's concerns and fears.

TIFU by jerking off and forgetting my PetCam was faced directly at me,"So I want to just say this is 100% true and 100% embarrassing. 


So I usually have Monday's off and spend the day doing homework, tidying up, playing video games, and today... jerking off. I don't usually feel inclined to do this however today I had the urge. It was about an hour before my girlfriend got home so I definitely had time. I go into my room and get into bed and start skimming thru Ol' Faithful AKA Pornhub. 

I finally find a video worth B'ing my L to and get down to business. As I'm about to... ya know... I get an alert on my phone that my girlfriend had just accessed the PetCam we have in our room that's on our dresser. (We got this PetCube camera for Christmas so we can watch our two dogs while we are at work/school/out.) I immediately stop, now knowing that my girlfriend just witnessed me jerking it mid-Monday so I text her ""........"" . She doesn't answer for about 2 minutes and then I see that she's calling me. 

Now we've been together 2.5 years so this isn't like a make or break thing and I honestly thought that although it was slightly embarrassing, it was also pretty funny. So I answer the phone laughing, ready for this to be something we joke about for a long time to come. Unfortunately, I was sadly mistaken to this being ""funny"". She tells me that her co-workers had asked about our dogs and she wanted to show them on our awesome PetCam! But instead of two cute dogs on our bed, it was just me with my shorts down at my ankles, going to town on myself! So needless to say I don't think I'll be invited to any of her work Christmas parties in the future.

TL;DR : Decided to crank it before my girlfriend got home and forgot my PetCam was faced directly at me. She wanted to show her co-workers our dogs and instead showed them me jerking it in our bed.

Edit: lmao just some clarification... she's shown coworkers before because they love our dogs and ask to see them because it's ""cute"" to see them live and sleeping. Also, in her defense, I told her I was doing homework and what not so the last thing to cross her mind was me yankin it probably. Also the cam is tucked in the corner so I forget it's even there most the time. (B'ing my L = blowing my load)

Edit 2 (last one) : for everyone saying ""why would you have a PetCam facing your bed?"" That's where our dogs are 90% of the time. When we are out of the house, that's where we leave them. When we are home, that's mostly where they want to be unless we're on the couch with them. Don't you think we put the camera there..... for a reason? Lol and btw, my gf and I are fine! She was freaked out about it at first but now it's already funny. That's why I love her so much lol so take it easy on her, we both fucked up!

I [27M] don't feel sexually compatible with my fiancee [27F],"*(posted from a throwaway account; I'd rather not have this on my posting history. I previously posted it, felt bad and deleted it, but having thought about it again I realise I need to get it off my chest.)*

I'm currently engaged to a girl that I absolutely love, we've been together for the best part of 10 years, and the wedding has been arranged for March. The start of that whole ""*wedding, buying a house and starting a family*"" time. Everything is pretty much perfect, apart from one issue: I feel like the bedroom is dead and/or we're just not compatible sexually.

Just to get the obvious out of the way:

1. I don't have any ""*extreme tastes*"" or anything like that; we're hardly talking about BDSM! Everything involved is distinctively *vanilla* \- i.e tie'n'tease, massages, or a little toy play.
2. Yes, we've been together for 10 years; but if I'm feeling this way before we're even married (**and when I'm still in my twenties**) then it genuinely concerns me about the future.
3. I *know* that communications are incredibly important in a relationship, yet it feels like we've discussed this topic before and.. it was pointless. Pointless either by her defensiveness, or just for the sheer lack of anything changing.

Sex is incredibly important to me - be it for intimacy, pleasure, or both. It just feels like we both have entirely different attitudes though. There are times where I want it slow, so as to savour it and take the most pleasure, there are times where I want it to be intimate and tender, then other times where I may want to be hard and energetic... regardless of these wants though, it's *the same*.

Often it feels like she uses friends as comparators - i.e ""*they haven't had sex in months - I dont know how they do that!*"". Well to be blunt, I'm not in a relationship with her friends, nor do I have the exact same desires as her friends. Other times she may say that I ""*never want normal sex*""; which just isn't true. It makes it sound like she's constantly dressing up or we're doing something exotic; she may put on some stockings 3 or 4 times a year, which I really appreciate... but that's it.

Previous chats have been fruitless, so I've tried to communicate in other ways. That's usually meant buying little things we could try - perhaps a couple of toys, or little tie'n'tease restraints. Quite often these would be used once or twice, and then thrown in a box to gather dust. So I've now opted for books, *specifically with topics for both me and her*, ranging from intimate massage to oral play. I hope this shows that I don't even care for specific fantasies, I just want to play and have fun, *and I recognise that's a two way street.*

She recently embarrassed me (I think she'd had a couple of drinks at the time, so I didn't say anything.) by talking to friends about one of the items I purchased. She made it sound like it was something exotic, it was a bit of an anti-climax when they realised it was just a wand. Yet as I sat there feeling awkward I just realised that I think it's pointless trying to communicate via items or books too, and in combination with words having no effect.. I just feel stuck.

We *have* spoken before about these things, but it never changes anything. She's never really spoken about what *she'd like*, hence me trying to experiment. Yet for me, the few turn-ons that I've mentioned - all incredibly vanilla at that (i.e stockings, tie'n'tease/edging, or simply seeing her enjoy herself.) - are just.. well, it feels like they're forgotten immediately after any conversation.

So I'm sitting here genuinely worried about the future; I have someone I love and I want to spend the rest of my life with, but similarly someone I don't feel compatibility with in a very important way. The last thing I'd want to do is to nag her or make her feel pressured; that's not acceptable. Yet I'm struggling with how this makes me feel; realistically I'm not bad looking, but I begin to focus on weight I could lose etc. It also changes my perception of her - I then begin to find her less attractive, and go off sex all together as *I simply don't feel fulfilled*. I just feel stuck.",relationship_advice

WIBTA if I report my doorman for calling me pretentious?,"I moved into a new apartment building about a month ago. It's a doorman building and most of the doormen are really nice. I always say a pleasant, ""Hi, how are you? Have a nice day/evening"" to them when I leave or enter the building, but I don't stop to chat to them as I have seen some of the other residents do.

&#x200B;

One of the doormen (whose shifts coincide with my coming home from work) has this habit of trying to strike up a conversation with me as I'm almost out of the lobby and heading down the hallway to the elevator - like, he'll shout out a question to me, or comment about the weather or something. I usually (pleasantly) shout back an answer and keep walking to the elevator, as I'm always exhausted after work and just want to go to my apartment and relax.

&#x200B;

The other day he shouted out to me, ""Come here, Miss Pretentious,"" so this time I turned around and walked over to the front desk and said politely, ""What did you call me?"" He then proceeds to say I'm pretentious and obviously think I'm better than everyone else in the building because I won't stop to talk to him or the other doormen. His tone wasn't angry or mean really, just kind of jokey but in a condescending way. I politely explained that it's not that I think I'm better than everyone but that I'm just really tired after work and want to go home. I also said I find it weird that he always tries to talk to me as I'm almost out of the lobby, thereby necessitating me turning around and walking back into the lobby in order to have a conversation (if I wanted to). He ended by saying that I won't fit in with the ""culture of the building"" if I keep on refusing to talk with the doormen. I told him (again, politely) that I wasn't really interested in fitting in with the culture of the building and told him to have a good night and I then walked away.

&#x200B;

Since then I have seen this doorman twice and both times he has greeted me with, ""Hello, Miss Pretentious"" (same jokey, condescending tone) as I walk into the building. I have completely ignored him both times.

&#x200B;

I feel like I should probably talk to him and tell him I don't appreciate being called that, but honestly I just want to report him to his supervisor as I'm getting sick of dreading walking into the building and I feel like I shouldn't have to deal with that in my own home (ok, building).

AITA for specifically ordering food my wife hates so I don't have to share?,"Yeah so I'm basically Joey from Friends before anyone states the obvious. I really really hate sharing food when I order out at restaurants or takeout. I always order just enough for myself so when someone grazes off my plate it makes me unreasonably upset. 

So my wife is a TERRIBLE food snatcher. She always says she's not that hungry and orders a small side or nothing at all, then slowly devours the food I've ordered. So many times I've ordered steak and fries just to end up competitively eating fries with her as we both race to get the last fry. I ask her to order her own stuff but she'll say she's not that hungry or my food looks better, etc. 

Anyways in the past year I've found a good trick where I simply order dishes with one ingredient she hates (cilantro, anchovies, carrots, or chilies) and she won't touch any of it. Recently some family members discovered I do this and called me a massive asshole. They called me childish for not sharing food with a spouse but honestly I'm just sick of not being able to eat a whole meal. AITA?

**Edit**: To those asking if I've told her to stop, I do, all the time, but it's honestly worse because then she sits there and eyes my food sadly. Or she'll sigh and push her own plate around and ask, sadly ""so how's your food? It looks really good..."" Or she waits until I'm taking a break to ask me multiple times if I've finished and if she could now have a bite, in the saddest voice possible like she's begging for scraps. It just feels super disconcerting when someone is so focused on me eating my meal.

HAPPY UPDATE: Wife(F33) and I (M34) decided to try for kids last year. Found out I'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.,"https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

I'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  I definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what I posted.  But hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes I guess.

Anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  I told her everything that was going on.  The Urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  I told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

She agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  She didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  She knew I was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. We talked about it Sunday, but I can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  And so while she had thought we were communicating, I wasn't.  We decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

The money was the real problem for me. She agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  Apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  She offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if I really wanted we could move the money back.  She does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

We read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  It seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. We're going to go back to the original specialist I was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  It turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  I told her I took off work to go with, and she was relieved I could join.

Once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  After going through each thing I was just wishing I believed her a little more before. She's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. She even offered an open phone policy if I needed.  We did look at the text I had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  I declined though right now, since I don't want to be that husband.

This has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. Even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  That level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  I think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. I was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  This has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but I'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

She thought that an NIPP ASAP was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  I'm not big on therapy, but I can probably agree that it will most likely help.

I'm feeling a little better about everything.  Thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (Every other comment here I read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   It's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**TL;DR  Use your words. - Wife and I objectively went through everything.  We both apologized, getting a NIPP soon and hopefully a therapist.**

MyLife.com has a profile on me with identifying information. Their website falsely claims I have a criminal record. Isn't that technically libel?,"Long story short, I googled myself and saw the first result was a link to a webpage for a company called MyLife.

It's a little jarring to see that a company I've never even heard of has a profile on me with my pictures, my hometown, political party, and phone number. It's a little more disturbing to see them falsely claiming that I have a criminal record, which is the first result for anybody who Googles my name.

It's not that big of a deal, but they seem to have this ""alert"" on everyone's profile saying that ""\[insert name\] DOES have Arrest or Criminal Records.""

I know anybody with more than two brain cells would realize that this website is a scam, but out of general curiousity, I was wondering if this would technically be considered libel, considering my record is perfectly clean save for a single traffic ticket for an expired registration sticker.

My parents won't let my husband and I claim our daughter on taxes (CA),"Hi guys, first time posting here so I'm sorry if I don't do this right, just looking for some advice. I'm 23 and my husband is 25, our daughter is 6. We have lived with my parents since our daughter was born. My parents won't let us claim our daughter on our taxes. We pay for her food, clothing and we pay rent to live in one bedroom. My parents said since they pay utilities they get to claim our daughter and we don't, and if we ever try they will kick us out. Is there something that can be done about this? Thanks in advance for any advice.

AITA for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her African American boyfriend to her grandparents?,"Let me just preface this by saying this: **I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO PROBLEM WITH INTERRACIAL RELATIONSHIPS.** Now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

My daughter (Anna) has recently started to date an African American man (Jamal). While I'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, I'm happy. The problem is Anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. While her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. As I said, I have no problem with mixed relationships and I've set them straight, but I am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

My parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and Anna expressed a desire to introduce Jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. I told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. I may have no problem with Jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. They might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. Anna was extremely upset by this and implied I was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

As I said, I know my parents. They simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if Anna were to bring Jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

Anna is currently staying with Jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. My wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when I introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend I confided in told me that I have behaved like an ass and that I needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

"[UPDATE] My (23F) [autistic] husband (36M) will only eat ""kiddie food"" [and lied by omission about his autism].","Previous post [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bobslu/update_my_23f_husband_36m_will_only_eat_kiddie/).

Well.

It's been a lot longer than the one week update I promised. I could make excuses but I won't.

For those of you who don't want to read my original post, I asked for help with my husband's food preference issues and through talking with many people on here and, ultimately, his mother, it was revealed that he was diagnosed with autism as a child.

Some of the comments on my original post were... not so kind. I got a lot of accusations that still hurt me. Some just make me angry, particularly the person who commented simply ""Please don't bully him."" He's my goddamn husband. Not a schoolyard friend, not a sibling, not a child. Infantilizing him doesn't help his case at all.

Moving on.

I was very upset as he had never mentioned anything to me. We've discussed all sorts of medical issues together but his diagnosis never came up.

I want to stress this: This isn't a matter of me not wanting to be married to an autistic man. This is a matter of my husband keeping something important from me and causing me a great deal of stress that could have been avoided if I was aware of his diagnosis.

For example, I continuously pushed him to try new foods or attend concerts or visit loud amusement parks. I knew he wasn't particularly thrilled about any of those things but they are all very normal couple activities that I wanted us to experience together. Had I been aware of his autism I would have had a better understanding of how negatively these things affected him, and made more of an effort to integrate things he liked with things I liked (maybe a smaller local band, or a craft fair instead of an amusement park).

Anyways. That's the backstory. Read below for the update.

**UPDATE**

I confronted him about my conversation with his mother the night before our counseling appointment. I made sure to bring it up casually so I didn't become angry again.

He tried to brush me off at first, saying he didn't know what I was talking about. After talking for a bit he eventually confessed that he not only knew of the diagnosis but deliberately kept it from me. He said I was his dream and he didn't want to do anything to ruin our ""perfect"" relationship.

I explained how him keeping this from me hurt me. I explained how I could have been there to support him instead of feeling like he needed to hide.

He said he wasn't ashamed of it at all. He explained that it's just not something that affects him anymore. I, again, explained how it affects me, but he didn't seem to care. I didn't show him the post I made but I used some of the advice from you all to try to explain why his autism really does in fact still affect his life.

We went to bed upset.

The next day he acted like nothing happened. We ate breakfast (he had chicken nuggets), and went about our day. I kept expecting him to bring it up but he never did.

I didn't have the nerve to bring it up again until later at the marriage counselor's office. I spoke to the counselor so as not to seem accusing and explained that this was an issue that bothered me.

My husband actually laughed and said he assumed I'd ""gotten over it by now"". When I explained that no, I really hadn't, he got angry with me and stormed out. The counselor tried to mediate but it wasn't much use as my husband went to wait in the car. I was worried he'd leave without me so I cut the meeting short.

Our ride home was quiet. It wasn't until we got home that I said I was worried he was keeping other things from me too.

He said he'd been reading online about how women can't understand autism and therefore he didn't think it was important to tell me about it. I said that was the weakest excuse I'd ever heard. He then said that I'd leave him if I knew. I said if I left him it'd be because he's a liar.

Apparently he told all of our mutual friends that he'd ""just"" been diagnosed with autism and I was considering leaving him because of it. Now many of our friends won't talk to me and act very cold when we run into each other in public. I don't know what else he's told them but I think he told someone I cheated on him as a fake account has been commenting horrible things about me and my supposed sexual habits on all of my instagram posts. I keep reporting them but then it seems like another just pops up in its place. 

I haven't decided if divorce is the right path. I know he's been browsing ""incel"" and other bitter male-centric websites (one of his friends is a self-described ""incel"") so I'm even more convinced that this isn't the man I married.

I'm mostly just confused. I've been avoiding him at home and it feels like more of a room mate situation at this point. He doesn't really leave his den until it's time for work, and then he's back in the den until bed.

It seems like everything is messed up, just from me wanting to help. I don't even know what to expect at this point, much less how to move on from here.

**EDIT**

There are so many more comments than I anticipated. I'm trying to at least read through most of them although I think I'm past my emotional ability to reply. I'm really shocked at how overwhelmingly supportive people are being. Thank you.

I'm going to be discussing divorce with a lawyer. I don't know how to bring it up with him but I'm past the point of caring. You're all right; I dread coming home to him in the evenings, I dread if he will miraculously want to talk. This isn't healthy for either of us. At the very least some time apart would be good.

That's all for now. I don't think I'll update past this, as I'm already uncomfortable with how quickly this blew up. But I will be living elsewhere by the end of the month.",relationship_advice
TIFU By letting my cat put his head in my mouth.,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. This just happened a few minutes ago. I was laying on my couch and my cat decided to jump up and lay on my chest as he often does. I had just eaten lunch, which was a chicken salad sandwich, so naturally my cat was intrigued by the smell and wanted to get a good whiff. He was sniffing around my face heavily, almost comically. I was feeling pretty generous at that time so I got the brilliant idea to open my mouth really wide to let him enjoy, but also because I was curious how far he would venture in. You know, normal pet owner stuff. He got his head about halfway in when suddenly he decided to let out a violent and very wet sneeze right into my mouth. I'm fucking disgusted, and the weekend has been ruined before it even started. 

TL;DR: My cat sneezed directly in my mouth.",tifu
"(NV) Brother-in-law was attacked 2 nights ago, shot several times, exchanged gunfire with the attacker. Police took his wallet with $1,500 in it, and have made a suspicious call to hospital.","Short backstory, my brother-in-law was ambushed outside of his home after being dropped off be a female coworker. The initial story is that her ex-boyfriend had followed them home and attacked my BIL when he got out of the car. My BIL returned fire and hit him, and they're both in the hospital. There are a lot of stories flying around between everyone, it's not clear yet what the whole truth is. Aside from that, I have two more practical immediate concerns.



The call that the police made to the hospital was requesting his medical file number. The nurses didn't disclose any information to the officer that called because my BIL was admitted into the trauma ward without his name being registered. Following that, the officer then called my MIL for the number, and told her it was so that he could see what the blood tests said. 


My wife told her mom to make sure it was all on the up and up before returning the call, and the nurses overheard and told my MIL to provide a recently assigned social workers number to the police, and tell them to handle whether or not the police have access to that information.


Sorry, I know that's long without a question, but I guess what I want to know is, is this actually a concerning event? Does this smell wrong? My brother in law doesn't have the best criminal history, but he's done a lot of work to expunge his records, and the gun he used to defend himself is legally his. The details are still pretty coming out, I understand why the police are investigating things, but there is a real concern that they are looking for something to besmirch his character. It feels like they want to find out if he had drugs in his system, and I just don't think that's appropriate for them to be looking at without a warrant.


Also what we can do to try to make sure he gets his money back? He had just cashed his paycheck and I've heard way too many stories about people losing their property to civil forfeiture.Can we demand some sort of itemization of things that they have seized from him as evidence? What can be done to ensure he gets his things back?

TIFU by leaving THC chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles,"My cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of THC chocolate for Christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. My parents are 75-year old Republicans. That was a big maybe.

&#x200B;

Well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. You put half a candy bar down and YOINK, gone when you come back.

&#x200B;

You can guess what happened. My mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. Her last words, high as a kite, were ""I think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200B;

They took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. At which point I assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the RedBull Orbit Jumper.

&#x200B;

Anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. So now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

&#x200B;

Obligatory gold edit: Thanks all for your well wishes! ! A few things to clear up - Mom went into the hospital on Saturday. As of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in Manhattan where she awaits surgery details. I'm in Canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but I'm planning to head back down to NY this weekend to be with her. Also....OP is not a dude. :)

Second update from my dad: Mom's surgery may be Thursday, with the holidays and all. I decided not to mention that I put the story on the internet.

FP Edit - Thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. I'm headed back to the States on Thursday, the tentative surgery date. Will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

UPDATE - Mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. Thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. All of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

TIFU by buying everyone an AncestryDNA kit and ruining Christmas,"Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

As soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn't want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

Fast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

TL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

Update:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

Update 2: CHRISTMAS ISN'T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family.

Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!

I am at a loss for words right now. I feel like my entire existence has been a lie. I have lived for 28 years and now I feel like I even know who I am anymore. 

I was helping my dad and stepmom clean up for a garage sale. I was in the attack and was going through a bunch of old boxes that hadn't been touched in years. I was looking through one box and there were some photos of me with aunts, uncles, cousins and other family members on my dads side. I had never seen these pictures so I looked through them all. After a few photos, they were just photos of me. Usually alone on a bed. Then there were photos of me naked. And I was crying. I dont really want to go into detail of the rest of the photos I saw. 

My parents were divorced, so this must have happened during Christmas or summer break since that's when I had visits with my dad. My mom is going to be devastated. I don't want her to blame herself. She tried hard to allow my dad custody. He was physically abusive towards her, he was wealthy so I guess he had a good lawyer.

I want a god damn new baseball glove, and I want it put under the god damn Christmas tree.  And Santa, I want a god damn new bike and I want it put under a god damn tarp in the god damn shed.""

Santa, in complete shock, pulled Little Johnny's parents aside and said ""In all my years, I have never seen a little boy with such a foul mouth.""

His parents replied ""We know, but we have no idea what to do about his behavior.  We've tried everything.""

Santa thought about it and said ""Here's what we'll do to teach him a lesson, every place that Johnny asked for a present, we'll put a pile of dog poop.""  The parents agreed to try Santa's plan.

"""You can't complain because x person has it worse"" is a really toxic idea."," Let me preface this by saying I do believe in being grateful for what you have. But there's a difference between that and using this argument to shut people up. I hate this for several reasons.

1. The people who say this almost never have it worse. They are usually putting words in the mouths of another group of people. I have a disability that limits my ability to walk. I don't complain about it much but I've been told not to because there are other people more disabled than me. I'm aware of that, but I've never been told this by someone who wasn't able bodied.

2. By the logic of this argument, the only people who are allowed to complain are dead or on the verge of death.

3. Complaining solves problems. Now, I can't speak for everyone with a disability, but I personally don't mind if an able bodied person complains about pain, as long as they let me do the same. In fact, I'm probably the best person you can complain to. I've had nerve and muscle pain for a long time and I grew up around lots of healthcare professionals, if you have pain, I might be able to help. 

4. Also prevents heart attacks because you let stress out when you complain. So even if it doesn't directly solve your problem, it lets off steam. Look it up.

5. Those people that actually have it worse aren't helped by my silence any more than they are by my complaints. Considering point 3, my complaining might actually help if I do it right. After all, isn't that what protesting is? Complaining on your own behalf or on the behalf of others to solve a problem? 

6. It's used to silence people who need help. I don't think I need to explain this part, you get it. 

7. It's human nature to complain. It just is.

UPDATE: AITA for not agreeing to house my pregnant teenage sister and her delinquent boyfriend after our parents disowned her?,"[OG Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cvzd4t/aita_for_not_agreeing_to_house_my_pregnant/)

It's been a little bit more than two weeks since my first post and I guess it's safe to say now that the situation has been resolved in probably the best way possible!!

In my last post, I stated that my sister was still living in the car of her delinquent boyfriend who sells drugs and refusing to come home because my parents had disowned her. At this point, I would like to clarify that my family and I are Chinese and it is common in Chinese culture to ""disown"" your kids when they do something that largely disappoints or embarrasses you. However, this is not a permanent disownment like many of you have brought up; as long as my sister apologizes sincerely and they can see that she is actively trying to fix her mistake and become better, they will take her back as their daughter. (Another clarification would be for those people who assumed that my dad kept us poor since he was stubborn and wanted to work on his business and not get a real job. His business was a passion project on the side. My dad was working 50 hours a week at two jobs.)

Alrighty, onto what ultimately happened with my sister. Despite the chain of advice I sent her, she ignored me still. I regularly checked in with her over the next week to see how she was and she gave me one word replies until they ultimately stopped. I was growing concerned after she didn't pick up her cell, but then I received a call from my parents!!! According to my mom, my sister had returned home crying and begging for forgiveness. She had a serious talk with my parents where she apologized for her behavior and promised to make amends. My mom was very tearful as well. They scheduled a doctor's appointment for her immediately and I believe she went in the next day.

I had no idea what made her finally break and return home so I texted her (first, I told her I was proud of her for taking action and being mature) and asked if anything happened between her and her boyfriend. At first she was pretty stubborn and kept insisting that she was just over living in a car, but after a while she finally admitted that her boyfriend had requested that *she start selling for him if she wanted to keep living in his car and eating his food that he was sneaking her*. LMAO. What a fucking asshole. Glad my sister finally returned to her senses. She told me she broke it off with him and I sincerely hope that's the truth.

This past Monday, she got the pills to successfully terminate her pregnancy. According to my mom, she was begging that they do is ASAP, which was really a breath of relief for all of us because we were worried she might want to keep it.

The future seems pretty bright right now for her. My parents decided to pull her out of the public school and send her to a progressive private school that some of my close friends also went to (it's a fantastic school and I think it'd be great for her). She's officially starting next Monday. I'm going to visit her and my family this weekend and see how she's doing. :)

TL;DR: Sis returned home safely and apologized to parents. Delinquent bf was forcing her to sell drugs for him in repayment for the hospitality that he has provided her in the form of the backseat of his car and McDonald's. Sis terminated the pregnancy and will be attending a new school next week.

EDIT: Forgot to add that the new school also has a wonderful counseling department. I urged my parents to speak to the head psychologist there and they did and she will be having mandatory weekly meetings with her and another therapist at the school. :)",AmItheAsshole

[UPDATE]Fired for being fat,"update to: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bx4q0p/fired_for_being_fat_ct/   

I posted this 2 weeks ago and a lot has happened. Something happened before I could go any further with the lawyer I spoke to.

The Monday following the incident I was asked to come speak with a VP of HR I'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. When I walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which I was told was part of legal. What I didn't realize, is my friend who I mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though I told him to keep it secret). This information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. I was asked to explain exactly what happened, who I told, and asked a lot of questions. Everything I said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when I told them I was in touch with a lawyer. They had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

This is the holy shit part. They say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt I would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if I wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. They also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. I took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. BTW I'm not stupid, I know they did this so I wouldn't take any legal action against them, but I love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. I also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

There's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and I finally have an office with a door I can actually close! I'm in the field a lot less now, so I guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now I don't interact face to face nearly as much as I used

TIFU by ripping my anus open,"
The following events transpired yesterday. Spent last night in A&E, on hardly any sleep and some pretty strong painkillers, so apologies for any mistakes here.

Me and my girlfriend are trying to lose weight, and so for the past few months we have been eating super clean. Salads, quinoa, lean meats, etc. (very few carbs). Lost some weight, gained some muscle from working out too. Very happy with our progress.

Because we had been so disciplined and it was my birthday, we decided to treat ourselves to our previously weekly treat of takeout. A huge pizza, fries, and nachos each (I know, hence why we needed to lose weight), washed down with soda. 

We went to bed feeling very full and happy, if a little guilty.

I awoke a few hours later with intense stomach cramps. I could feel a ball of pizza nacho fries forming in the pit of my stomach and could tell it was not going to be pretty coming out. I waited till morning to go to the bathroom (small apartment, light sleeper gf), and as soon as I sat down on the crapper and pushed, I felt the most intense pain in my anal sphincter. Like it was being pulled apart from every angle. My girlfriend, who I had woken up by screaming, was now banging on the bathroom door thinking I was being murdered.

The worst part was that I couldn't exactly pinch this bad boy off, as the seal had been broken and my 'pincher' was now severely compromised. So I pushed through the pain, and could feel the ripping worsen with each push as this dry, fibrous monster made it's way out of my asshole. After about 25 minutes I had birthed the hellsnake. I only wish I had taken a photo as this thing was a sight to behold.

A painful car journey and 3 hour wait later, the doctor said I had the worst anal fissures he had ever seen. Apparently the turd was so fat and hard it'd literally ripped my asshole open in multiple places.

Sitting is agony, they itch and burn like hell and I can feel a second boulder pushing its way into my lower intestine. 

For all you sickos:

Dimensions: Difficult to say. Closer to Randy's first record attempt than I would be comfortable disclosing.

Courics: I don't know, I forgot to contact the European Fecal Standards team for verification. I would say more than one, less than four.

Color: Dark. I drink a lot of coffee.

Texture: Like a sock filled with broken marbles. 

TL;DR Avoided bad food for months, gorged on pizza and nachos, gave birth to a baby sized turd that ripped my anal cavity open on its way out, resulting in the worst anal fissures my doctor had ever seen. AMA

Edit: I'm sorry Reddit, I didn't take a photo. I wish I did. I wish I could go back in time and fix this...wait, no I don't. I don't want this to turn into a Reddit fable where my compromised pincher is being spread between the dark corners of the web for the rest of time, so no I will not be squatting over a mirror and taking a picture of my anus. Sorry. I also love my girlfriend too much to ask her to get in there with a camera; there's no use in two people being traumatized by this.

For all those sending get well messages and asking for updates: thank you sincerely. My girlfriend got over her anxiety and collected a cornucopia of stool softeners, numbing sprays, ice packs, and everything else imaginable. Thank you all for the advice. She and the chemist shared a laugh when she showed her the story. How nice...",tifu
"If your dog has cancer and you opt for chemo, you're a bad person.","An old dog lives to be 15. They are also the most loyal and perfect friend could ever possibly hope for. We truly are not good enough for dogs. On the grand scale of intelligence in this world, they are also complete and total idiots. They don't understand medicine. They don't understand that you are trying to extend their life. 

All they know is that on a regular basis the most important person in their life, their owner, is taking them to a strange, smelly, terrifying torture arena. They are stabbed, poked, prodded and their veins are filled with poison. The next thing they know they have gone from terrified to nauseated, fatigued and just feeling like absolute shit. And you, their human, are doing it for what? To squeeze out a tortured 1 - 5 more years?

They don't understand and they can't consent. Let your beautiful friend enjoy the last few months in peace and then send them off surrounded by their family. You're not trying to save your dog, you're being cruel because you don't want to let go.

So, it has come to my attention that I was pretty misinformed on how pets react to chemo and the purpose of it. Thanks to those of you who were willing to explain without your pitchfork and torch at the ready. [For more information on pets and chemo I went to this site, seems reliable](https://wvrc.com/veterinary-specialties/veterinary-oncology-wi/chemotherapy-general-information/). 

In keeping with the spirit of this sub I'd be willing to alter my unpopular opinion to instead state, ""If your dog has ~~cancer and you opt for chemo~~ *a serious health condition and you opt for expensive treatment*, you're a bad person.""

I know how hard it is so say goodbye to your pet. The reason I think you're a bad person is because you're willing to pay exorbitant medical expenses to extend an animal's life because you don't want to say goodbye, ESPECIALLY in instances when the animal is suffering.

In closing, I get it. Putting your pet down is a VERY personal decision, but I still get to think you're a bad person if I think your reasons are shitty.",unpopularopinion

How can I hide my depression from my dog?,"This sounds so stupid.. but whatever, here we are. 

I am very depressed. I cry most days, I go to work and come home and don't really do much but stare at my wall, don't have any friends etc. 

I play with my dog a lot, take her on long walks, and take care of her because she doesn't need to suffer just because I do. But I can tell it makes her sad when I'm sad. She whimpers and tries to climb all over me and lick my face until I stop crying. I've tried to just smile a lot and use sweet voices to her but I can literally tell she is not buying it. She just ignores the toys I throw for her and treats and tries to comfort me instead. 

Is there something I can do to trick her?

AITA For Telling My Wife That If She Quits Her Job I Expect Her To Cover All The Housework?,"My wife wants to quit her job. She wants to be a SAHM to spend more time on with 4 year old daughter and stop leaving her at daycare centres.


In order for her to do that, I would have to sign for a higher paying job schedule, about 2 hours more per day and occasionally half day on Saturdays. I told her that I if she quits her job then I expect her to cover all the housework. I may not be splitting the chores with her, since having longer working hours is rather tiring. I will will help out on weekends but during weekdays I rather rest. 


My wife then told me she that is not a housekeeper and I am being lazy and discriminative against women. I don't really mean that, as I think it is fair that if she stops contributing to our household income she can handle all the housework. I will also become the sole breadwinner and work extra hard to support the family. AITA?


Edit: I admit that I did not really used a nice tone while talking to my wife because I was was having conflicted thoughts on either supporting her choice or trying to talk her out of it. Our household income isn't that high to begin with and it will be difficult to be the only provider. Ofcourse, I also think that my wife has every right to want to spend more time with our daughter and it would be good for both of them.",AmItheAsshole

"Son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.","This has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. We sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. His allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

We had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. We even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

So we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. Now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and I can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. He continued to adamantly deny doing that and said Mrs gave them to him. 

We then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. Again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

Once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". Okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? He's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

Another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""Do not worry! This won't happen again"". We have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

Then, the very next school day (the meeting was on Friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. We figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. We send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. We get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? He should have known to ask to begin with. We are teachers not parents.""

We have no issues for a while until this week. Some parent brought in PB&J sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. He forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". We find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. He was not given this one. We spent a day at the hospital.

We've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? Do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? The school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. He gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. This is in Indiana, any help is appreciated.",legaladvice

TIFU by saying the worst possible thing in a restaurant,"This happened a few hours ago in a busy buffet restaurant in a hotel in Austria.

Being a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly Austrian and German people passing our table. We've been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.

I was joking with the kids  that I'd left their Nintendo Switch at home, they suspected I was joking but went along with it anyway. So when I told them I had brought it they wanted to check.

""I brought it,"" I said 

""Our Switch?""

""Yes, Our Switch""

""What?!! OUR Switch?!""

""Yes!! OUR Switch!!""

They got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. I noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn't really register.

""OUR SWITCH?""

""OUR SWITCH! Ha!""

Then my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - I was like ""it's ok... it's a buffet""

""OUR SWITCH! Ha!""

""OUR SWITCH!""

Then my wife leaned in and urgently whispered ""it sounds like you are all shouting Auschwitz""

My whole body went cold with the realisation.

Needless to say I immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son's knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before I could stop him... 

I have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. 

TLDR: Shouted ""Auschwitz"" loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of Germans and Austrians. I'm really sorry.

EDIT: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! My first. To those calling BS: I wish it was. To the genial Germans and Austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - I will sleep better tonight because of you. And for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it's a kinderhotel. Kind of like if Michael Bay did buffets.

EDIT2: just to all my salty comrades telling me I'm a ""scum cunt"", that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud. I fucking love you Reddit! I'm reassured that you are all so considerate when it comes to noise in public spaces. You wouldn't like this restaurant ... stone walls, stone floors, a hotel designed for kids. It's like a school playground where they've all been given metal objects to smash together but louder. Our risky exchange was lost in the cacophony to anyone who wasn't walking past our table..",tifu

I let my friend's husband watch her on video call,"Okay listen...moved from r/AITA

My friend ""Sarah"" is on her 3rd marriage at 29. She's got an alcohol problem and gets herself into stupid situations and has cheated on all her partners since I've known her. Her current husband is a great guy, but kind of naive. He really has no clue - he just loves her so much. A couple weeks ago he stopped by my work, and after some small talk he straight up asked me if I had seen or heard of Sarah seeing other men. I told him I honestly didn't know, because I don't \*know\* 100%. He seemed really beat. It was awful. Fast forward to this past weekend, few of our friends got together, and she started to tell us about some dude she met. I was a little buzzed, so I decided to try to sneak her on video. I clicked on my contacts and sent him a video call and he actually picked up. I pretended to be into my phone and just let it roll. He ended the call abut 2 mins in but it was enough to hear what she was talking about. The next day I felt sick at myself for what I did, but my husband thinks he needed to find out, and deep down I do too. I have no idea what's going on or if Sarah's husband even confronted her. Am I the worst person ever?

Edit: I also previously knew the husband from middle school band! So I was the probably his first choice in confiding/asking.  ""Sarah"" is the one problem child of our group. She has 5 kids (NONE OF THEM HIS BTW), so she rarely goes out and is more on the periph. Also, she was a guest at my wedding and stole the microphone to sing - and that was like 10 years ago.  I care about her as a human, but Sarah is probably the one toxic person I need out of my life. This'll probably do it.",relationship_advice

Update: My [20/M] girlfriend [19/F] has an incest fetish and wants me to pretend that she's my sister during sex,"Original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bj0hpb/my_20m_girlfriend_19f_has_an_incest_fetish_and/

After reading the comments in the original thread, it really made me wonder if she was intentionally trying to look like my sister for the sake of her fetish. It never crossed my mind after she admitted her fetish to me until I read the comments. The thought of that made me even more uncomfortable than before, so I decided to question her intentions.

I sat her down again and asked her if copying my sister's look was part of her fetish. She said she was really embarrassed but admitted to me that it was. I told her thank you for being honest with me, but that I am really weirded out by it. She said she understands why it weirds me out and apologized for not telling me sooner.

After she apologized, I told her that I'm okay with her fetish and that I'm willing to try roleplaying with her, however there will be conditions for it. My conditions are that she changes her makeup style and dyes her hair a different color, or goes back to her natural color, so that I don't feel like I'm having sex with my actual sister. She agreed without any hesitation and said that it was fair for the both of us, thankfully.

Since that conversation, she has dyed her hair back and has started learning different makeup styles independently from my sister. We haven't tried the roleplaying thing out yet, but I feel comfortable with the idea of it now, So I don't think it will be a problem.",relationship_advice

Acne can actually make a person more attractive.,"I have always thought that if you had acne it automatically makes you unattractive. However, in my experience, for certain people it honestly kinda of fits well. Have you ever met a person who you couldn't imagine without glasses? I'm convinced for certain people its the same with acne. To clarify, I am not talking about severe cystic acne. Painful cystic acne is a unfortunate ordeal and the person who has it should seek treatment for it. But people who have some minor scarring/breakouts it can really add to the character of their faces. This kind of laid back, natural, hippie kinda look. I can't really put my finger on it. It would be almost boring if you saw them with immaculate skin. And even though its already a golden rule, if they have confidence with their skin its even a bigger bonus.

Edit: 

Well this has never happened before. It's been kind of hilarious to read these comments going from: ""you're an absolutely disgusting vile human being"" to ""I 100% AGREE WITH YOU"". I'm also surprised at how unpopular this opinion really is! But I guess I put it in the right place lol. I'm not sure people should be thanking me either. I can be quite shallow as well. This is just one those subjective quirks I really enjoy and thought needed to be pointed out. But really if you read the comments some of the things YOU guys are into is pretty unconventional. Beyond all these superficial traits though, I think the biggest thing to remember is that sometimes love just happens to you. You don't get to choose it. So stop worrying about who you're gonna pick.

Sister opened a student loan under my name 8 years ago.,"Like the title says, my sister (2 years older than me) opened a student loan in my name 8 years ago, just after I turned 18.

The only reason I found out was because I got a letter a few months ago from the servicer who holds the loan giving me the amount of interest paid on it last year for taxes. I thought it was a mistake at first but when I told my mom about it in passing a couple of days ago, she said she thought my sister had paid off the student loan. 

Yesterday, I dug around a bit and found the letter, called the company, and found out I have about $15,000 more in debt to my name than I thought because of it. I'm going to be buying a house soon and I'd rather this just go away completely but the servicer insists I'm on the hook for it. For what it's worth, she's never missed a payment on it. What would I do in this case to get the loan company to make her responsible for it?

Edit: I'm in Wisconsin. To be clear, my parents didn't know about it and they are pretty pissed. My sister has a good job and I think she might be able to pay it all back in one go. She's literally never been in trouble with the law before and (before this) seemed like a great person.

TIFU during my first surgery as a 3rd year medical student,"
I'm a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship ""assisting"" on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. In this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. If you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. As this was my first laparoscopic surgery, I soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. Like many of you, I had no idea this role even existed, but I quickly accepted my new job as 'vagina sealer'. I approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. I placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. After several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  The attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said ""do you know where the vagina is? Get that stopper out of her ass!""

He says, ""Yeah, I think maybe someone is giving out my number because they keep asking if {my first name} is available.""

I said, ""That happens to me from time to time as well, people think I'm {old homeowner's name} or {bosses name}. Oh well. Email me if you change your number.""

He says ""I will. Actually they ask for **you** pretty much all the time. What's your number? I bet they are getting us confused.  It seems strange almost all of them ask for you even thought we're not related"".

I gave him my work number.

Tl;Dr I'm free

I really want to thank each one of you who commented on my previous post. This wasn't a decision I took lightly and it took a great deal of swallowing my pride. 

I would like to say I dumped him as soon as I read everyone's comment about him being abusive. Unfortunately it took me a bit longer to come to my senses. The following things happened after my post...

I tried to talk to him about being unhappy and saying he needs to leave. He told me to shut up and leave him alone. I told him I'm not leaving until we finish talking. He started to do the dishes and he said if I didn't shut up he was going to start to break a dish for every word I said. I didn't stop talking. He threw a bowl at my feet and I stepped in glass. He started profusely apologizing after he realized my foot was bleeding. He telling me he loves me. I stupidly forgave him.

Later he called my work screaming at me to get the fuck home. I kept asking why? He told me get the fuck home now or I'm going to kill myself. I start crying and freaking out because he has the kids and I hear the baby crying. I start asking is the baby ok? He says shut up and get the fuck home. Hangs up. I panic and leave work right away. I try calling him the whole drive home (20minutes). I'm panicking thinking my children are in danger. I come home and it turns out the baby pooped in his diaper and things got a little messy when trying to change him.. I was like are you serious? I told him I understand he was stressed out but he can never call me like that at work ever again. He called me selfish and a cunt.

When I realized in that moment I feared him hurting my baby.. I knew this had to end. Regardless of how much I thought I loved him. If his mom stopped watching the kids.. I'd figure it out but I couldn't do this my whole life. I was exhausted physically and emotionally. I didn't care if I was alone forever because no one wants a single mom of 2 kids.. I just wanted to live in peace. 

So the day I did it. I couldn't talk to him in person because he would twist my words around and I did not want to be subjected to more violence. I wrote him a letter. I wrote down everything I could think of. I recalled every memory of him that has scarred me over the last 8 years. I told him I already do this alone it's time for me to actually be alone. With the letter was my ring he gave me. I told him don't fight this. You can contact me but only to see the kids. I had packed a bag and went to my parents. I told him I would gather the rest of things in a few weeks.

It's been hard. I wake up in panic thinking what have I done but then I come to my senses and realize how calm I feel. I don't feel like I'm walking on egg shells anymore. I don't even care if he's right and no one else wants me. I'm happy again. Thank you reddit. I don't think I would've finally gotten the courage with you guys. 

Edit: wow I did not expect this response. Thank you so much for the support. I just wanted to clear up some things.
I will not be going over alone. I originally planned on bringing my dad but I did not know about the police escort. I will definitely have to look into that.
I will not let him have his children alone. I will drop them off at his parents house for him to visit with them.
I didn't realize when I posted my original post that these were abusive tendencies. I thought because he wasn't physically abusive it didn't count. Once people started telling me that wasn't the case I realized this had been going on for over 5 years. He punched holes in all our houses. Have thrown several dishes. Screamed at the top of his lungs at me. Once called me at work because he locked himself out of the house while I was at work. I told him he could either go to his moms for 2 hours or wait for me. He started spamming hate texts saying fuck you bitch, cunt, whore, etc. when I ignored his texts he started calling the phones at work saying the same things. 

Lastly people are saying why I had kids with him or why I couldn't see how bad this was. Well because I was with him since I was 15. From 15-20 it was great. He was my first love. First everything. I had nothing else to compare it to when the anger started. I thought every relationship had its issues and these were mine. He told me I was the crazy one when I would say something. I love my kids and never regret bringing them into the world. They gave me a purpose.

Thanks again..",relationship_advice
AITA for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?,"A few months ago, my brother and now SIL announced their intention to marry. The invitation to the wedding stated ""No dress code. Wear whatever is comfortable for you."" In hindsight, I think they put that there since the event was at a lake. I didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, I should dress respectably for such an occasion, and I have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. I chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

Yesterday was the wedding. When I showed up, I noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than I was. I'm talking Polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. I did feel a little out of place. My brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my SIL was wearing a modest white dress. The only comment I got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying I looked like I'm marrying the SIL, but that was it.

A few hours ago, I got a call from SIL. Holy shit, she is pissed at me! She was asking why I dressed like a pimp, I upstaged her and my brother, and I stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. I referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and I was dressing respectfully. She was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. I told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. She asked if I was that retarded. I told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. I hung up. She spammed my phone with calls, so I blocked her and texted my brother I'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

Was I in the wrong?

Edit: clarified she said I stuck out on the photos.

Edit 2: My brother said I'm welcome to come over for dinner later. I unblocked her number. No call spam, so that's a good sign.

Edit 3: Had dinner with my brother and SIL earlier. She showed me the pictures, and I can kind of see what she was talking about. I told her I'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because I did notice I was out of place and I should have tried to do something. She said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. So yeah, I don't think we're gonna be on Jerry Springer as far as I can tell.",AmItheAsshole

[OH] Sister stole ~$4500 necklace and pawned it for $50,"First, I'm writing this for my friend since she doesn't have an account.

Her sister stole a ~$4500 necklace (that was given to her by her deceased uncle) from her dads house and sold it to a pawn shop for $50.  We don't know exactly when (her sister claims it was months ago), but my friend got [this](https://imgur.com/a/BfmkWyJ) in the mail.  There was a receipt included and the pawn shop should have her ID on record.  Also, her mom and her sister have basically admitted to all of this in text messages and claim they're going to get the necklace back ""eventually""

So, obviously she wants to go get the necklace back herself (since it's unlikely that her mom is going to do it) and file a police report.  How exactly should we go about this?  My plan is to go to the pawn shop, see what info they can give us, then go file the police report, then go BACK to the pawn shop and ask how we can get the necklace back.  We would prefer to not have to pay for the necklace, so could we pay for it and then have her mom pay us back?  Also, what is likely to happen to her sister?

This is honestly a really upsetting time for her and her family, and the top priority is getting the necklace back and I personally would like her sister to face consequences for her actions since this isn't the first time (and probably won't be the last time) she's stolen from family.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: well I went to work and missed all the action before the post got locked so a few things:
1) thank you all for the advice
2) I got downvoted a lot for saying we were waiting until Monday, and even got a few messages telling me we obviously didn't care that much - we physically *can't* go until then, we both have jobs and other life circumstances (and honestly, that's really personal and I don't think I need to explain why). I understand it's not ideal but hey, that's life. Please stop yelling at me about it. 
3) the notice was on a postcard - no mail was opened

UPDATE 8PM EST: necklace has been returned, along with the receipt saying her sister sold it then took it back. Still going to the police on Monday. Thanks for the help again!",legaladvice
Plastic bottled water in first world countries should be banned,"Someone made me realise today that in the west we legitimately flush our toilets with water cleaner than 90% of the world and yet we totally avoid drinking our tap water.

I mean in capital cities of Australia our tap water is perfectly safe, everywhere,  even public bathrooms,  so why wouldn't you just drink it?

Friends is an overrated show and shouldn't have been kept on Netflix at the cost of increased subscription payments,"Although friends is considered to be loved by ""everyone"", it has been blown out of proportion by fans claiming it to be the best thing on tv forever and always. I don't think that people who only have Netflix to watch friends, or people that say they will cancel their subscription if its removed are serious. Just buy the box set for friends and for a single price, why keep paying a monthly subscription to just watch a single show? Netflix has paid around $100 million for the show to stream throughout 2019, and the payment before that was $30 million according to New York Times. That money could've been spent getting more recent shows and movies that people want or enjoyed to continue to stream on the service for more that 6 months in some instances. 

Tl;dr: Netflix should stop wasting money on friends and focus on newer shows",unpopularopinion

"AITA for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room?","I (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that I can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

My 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. My sister and I have never really got on, when I got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks I force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). So, when I went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, I was shocked to find my sister there alone. I asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

My sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why I think this happened. I huffed because I was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. My sister rolled her eyes. I asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch TV until mom came back. My sister said 'absolutely not, I hate children and I don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

Now, I completely understood this and I think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. I called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. My sister rolled her eyes and said 'Fine, I'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. I was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. I didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

So I left, and went for the bus. Literally five minutes later I get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the ER because she cracked her head open on the living room table. Apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

I am absolutely raging at my sister. I don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. She argues that I 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which I feel I didn't. She says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but I feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

My old boss is hellbent on getting me fired from my new position,"**Cross post from r/relationships. They told me to come here for advice. It is a wall of text but I needed to make sure I had all the important information.**

Hey everyone first off let me say, throw away because a lot of people know my main account. Also, I apologize for the wall of text that is ahead.

Forgot TL:DR

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

So 5 years ago I graduated college and was applying to PA programs. I unfortunately did not get in any programs that fall, so I decided to move to a big city on the west coast. I applied to more schools out west and didn't get in. I then decided my best bet was to get more patient care hours so I got a job in a hospital, it wasn't ideal because my degree unfortunately is meaningless without grad school.

The job I get was entry level but it paid well and I was able to start paying back student loans and learn about inner workings of hospitals and see different departments. I loved my job because I was able to interact with patients, nurses, doctors pretty much all hospital staff.

I was hired on the midnight shift and during my first year I asserted myself as a leader and someone you could depend on. I worked almost 3200 hours my first year as my department was always short staffed so overtime was easy to come by.

After my first year there I still wasn't accepted into any grad school programs. But a leadership position on afternoons opened up and I applied for it and was interviewed by a panel of managers, my manager and several others.

I and 6 others out of 24 were brought back for a second interview, this one didn't involve my manager. I was told by the panel the only reason I wasn't outright given the job is because my manager didn't believe I would do a good job and she seriously doubted my leadership skills.

I agreed that I wasn't the most assertive person, but I would do my best to lead by action and speak up when I needed to. The panel informed me that, my job wasn't to force others to work harder, that was my managers job to make sure everyone was pulling their weight.

After a few weeks I got a call and was told I got the promotion I to the lead position. A few people who had been there longer than me gave me trouble the first few weeks because, ""we have seniority"" I told my manager and she said she would handle it.

We had what I thought was a good relationship, but it quickly became apparent she would have rather had someone else in my position, someone who would follow her direction without question even if it compromised patient care or privacy.

About 6 months after I took my current position we had several employees switch departments or quit. I was working 7 days a week 12 hour shifts until they hired enough new people to fill our voids. This took around 4 months. At that time I was accepted into a local PA program and would start the following spring.

I continued working when school started but much less than what I was before because of school. During this time my relationship with my manager deteriorated even further and she made it clear she wanted me gone. The only thing was, her boss, the director of nursing ranted and raved about what a wonderful job I was doing and even though we were at 3/4 staff I was still able to manage all the work.

I finally graduated from my program 2 1/2 years after I started. At that point I needed a break from all work as I was work in 40 hours a week on top of 36 hours of interning/clinical work as well as studying. I requested all of my PTO to be used to go back home as I hadn't left to see my family in over 5 years. My PTO was approved by HR and I took off, I had 2 full months off.

During my time off I got a call from the Emergency Department, they really wanted me to come in and be a trauma PA, I was also called by our stroke unit where I did a vast majority of my internship and they were interested in me coming to them to work. I was ecstatic because both the Emergency Department and Stroke Unit were places I wanted to work. I talked it over with my family and decided to work for the Emergency Department.

I called my boss and told her that I was putting in my 2 weeks and since I had a month and a half left on my vacation I figured I would be fine starting in the ED when I returned. I told her I was offered a full time PA position and she seemed really excited for me. I notified the ED that I would be graciously accepting their offer, and that I could start as soon as I got back.

My friend who works in the department told me my boss was livid I was quitting but I didn't think much of it. I said it was too bad and people leave all the time when it is their turn to move on.

I left it at that, I was very ready to get back to the hospital and begin working. However, when I returned, i ram into a bunch of issues, firstly, HR did transfer me to the ED as a clinical staff member but didn't terminate my previous job title. My first day, my badge stopped working I couldn't use it to get into my work area, locker room, the building. I went into HR and they said my previous manager said I wasn't part of the company anymore and to terminate my badge access.

Odd but I told them I was now a PA in the ED and showed them my new credentials. They reluctantly allowed me access to my work areas.

The next week, I am pulled aside by my new boss. He asks me how everything is going and if I can swing by his office after my shift. I tell him yeah thinking it's going to be a check up on how the new job is going.

My shift ends and I go to my new bosses office. He asks me why he is hearing so many negative things about me. I ask him what he means and he tells me I have had 3 formal complaints filed against me. I ask him if I can see them and he pulls them up on his computer. The first one is about unprofesionalim in the workplace. I ask him who filed it and he said it would be better if he kept it anonymous because the second complaint was about workplace violence. The third complaint was a HIPPA violation claim.

I was taken aback because the first two complaints came from 2017, when I was in my original department. The third complaint was when I went to clean out my previous locker and I was verbatim, ""Throwaway was in a secure loaction where he sought out potential information about patients."" It was the break room that doubled as out locker room, I was only there for 5 minutes to clean out my locker.

I went to HR because all of these are serious allegations and they told me all 3 complaints were made by my former manager. I was upset that all this was happening and there is basically nothing I can do. HR conducted a formal investigation on me and found nothing to be out of place.

A few weeks later my new boss had a sit down with my previous manager where she told him, ""she will stop at nothing until I am fired."" And, ""He is the most lazy and unprofessional worker in this entire establishment.""

I went to HR to file a complaint about her and potential harassment. HR told me they are unable to file my complaint because I am under review for corrective action and a manager would never do anything like that so I should just drop it while I am ahead.

About a week later I passed my old manager and she called out me me and said, ""wow, I'm surprised you're still here, I wouldn't want a provider taking care of me with your reputation"" in a hallway in front of patients, nurses, doctors and visitors.

I tried to schedule a meeting with her to talk but she said there was ""nothing to talk about"" and my actions are ""reprehensible"" and soon enough I would be ""where I belong, out the doors""

I heard from my boss that she has been scheduling meetings with higher ups about me and my boss doesn't know if it is going to work if this ""drama"" continues.

I don't know what I should do because, I have done nothing but display the up most respect for her, she is just hellbent on ruining my career at the facility and any other place I try and move to. Is there any action I should be taking right now? I feel like I should retain a lawyer and send a cease and desist letter, because her actions and false claims could be damaging my future.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

TL:DR; old boss is hellbent on getting me fired, spreading lies and making my new job a living nightmare.

Edit: for u/commonWerewolf

Firstly, my manager was well aware 2 1/2 years before I left that as soon as I was done with school I would be moving on fairly quickly. She was very supportive at that time and understood because there are a lot of college kids who work in the department while they are in school.

My last full year in school we (my manager, myself, the other afternoon leader, the 2 night time shift leaders and the weekend leaders) sat down to choose another lead. One of the night time people wanted my position which my manager agreed to. We also took applications from department workers to fill the now open night time lead position and filled it a full year before I would be done with school.

My 2 months were approved by HR and then by my manager, we have to have double approval. She said, this was wonderful because she could rotate her new crew in as I HAD been reeling back my duties. The new night time leader was originally on my shift and he had gradually been picking up my work per my managers request to train in the leadership role, which he's excelled at.

My manager knew I hadn't been home in almost 5 years and that I really needed a break because in those 5 years I had a full week off for sickness, and a handful of random days here and there. Most of the time I was at work, didn't have a social life, that's ok I was a grad student didn't really need one. I missed out on a lot of things because I was willing to put in 60+ hours a week.

When I went on my vacation I was not expecting to get a new position but my manager was aware that my application was out and that I could get a call that I could not turn down.

Also, when I did put in my 30 day notice, I did call and I talked with her. I told her I was more than willing to start my 30 days when I returned but was told we already have the replacements inline and that they are working out well so it wasn't necessary to delay my transfer.

I have done everything professionally and by the books. I always conducted myself in the most professional manner I could while improving patient care. We had replacements picked out a whole year before I left. The two who took over are both in school and will be there for an extended period of time because the department works incredibly well with school schedules, that is why I stayed so long.

And yes I said that to my friend because I genuinely didn't care at that point because I had multiple okays from my manager to transfer. So I wasn't so beat up about her being upset after I had the go ahead to leave.

TIFU by leaving my Facial Cleansing Brush in my boyfriend's parents bathroom,"This happened 2 weeks ago and I've only just stopped cringing entirely when I think about it.

My boyfriend and I were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. I took a shower, and I remember feeling really smug because I remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. For anyone that doesn't know what it is, it's literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. 

After using it, I wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when I had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. It's important to note that I had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the 'head' of it.

Anyway, everything's fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and I are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for ""a word"" with my boyfriend. We both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.

After a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says ""why did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?""  Obviously I was perplexed, saying I REALLY had no idea what he was talking about. He was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as ""pink with a big bulb"" and then it hit me.

I too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as I explained what it was. Unfortunately, I didn't realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. 

""You don't have to lie BloatedRabbit, it's ok but just next time don't leave it around for everyone to see.""

""I swear on my life it's a face cleanser!"" I said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. I handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. My boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he's a dirty old man for thinking like that. His dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when I think about it.

""Well I'm sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother's toys!"" 


I'm not religious at all, but when I say I wanted God to beam me up there and then... I'm not kidding. I felt like jumping out the window. The whole energy of the room shifted. His dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn't dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.

Worst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. My boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. Talk about awkward.

TL;DR I left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend's conservative parents bathroom. His dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend's mum's toys.",tifu

Am I in the wrong after getting angry at my boyfriend for letting his friend see me naked?,"Context. Happened a few days ago. Me and my boyfriend were staying in a hotel with his friend and his wife (we've been together 3 years). We were all drinking and after awhile his friend and wife left. Me and my boyfriend had drunk sex and then went to bed.

After awhile his friend came back alone. My boyfriend got up which woke me up. I was half asleep, and heard the friend say something about my body. My boyfriend asked if he wanted to see. I was on my side away from them and heard them walking over. I panicked and didn't know what to do. Was I suppose to jump up and let them know I was listening? Freak out? (I have sever anxiety so this caused an attack). I froze and he lifted up the covers I was under. Edit: I was naked 

I confronted him the next day but he says I wanted him to see me because I didn't stop him and he should be upset at me but is understanding and I should be too so we can let it go.

Am I an asshole? Can I not be upset because I didn't stop it?

Update: thanks everyone so much for support/ advice. I've been with this guy forever and we were talking about starting to do foster care and marriage. I thought I was crazy and this wasn't as big a deal as I was making it since I wasn't touched or anything. I'd like to make an update after I talk with him again. When you make one do you just add it in here or make a new post? Im new to this.

To everyone saying it's ultimately my fault for not doing anything, mental illness is paralyzing. I was sexual abused as a kid and this was the same way my body made me (or wouldn't let me) react. I wasn't sure at first but I know I didn't do anything wrong. 

I'm sorry if it seemed like an obvious answer. It's hard to accept these things when it's someone you had a future with.

It has been about a month or so since I posted and I figured I would update you guys(since I love updates). Unfortunaly is not a good one...

My father asked for a divorce about a week after the post, it caught me out of guard and I was shocked. They talked before this but my dad came home even more upset than the day on the restaurant.

He asked me whether I'd like to live with him or my mom and I chose him. I love my mom to death but on the day-to-day basis I get along better with my father. I called her to explain but as soon as I said said she disconnected the call so yeah.... I wrote her a letter and tried to give when we went home to her our things but she ripped off, which was very painful to see. My dad and brother started screaming at her and I left with my SIL.

I went with my dad to have a consultation with my psychologist and they tried to help me see why she is doing this. From what I can understand, there might be some reasons

I went through a pretty tough period, I got depressed, anxious and had some problems with eating disorder but I've been in medication and therapy, which has helped a lot. After this I felt much happier and had energy to work on myself, I started working out with my brother, my SIL teached me how to use make up and my grandma gave me a bunch of gift cards to buy some new clothes. I've also started trying new hobbies and my days are really busy.

We think that my mom started feeling left out and jealous of me, especially since my brother/dad started paying more attention to me and I know they have actively making an effort to compliment me and pay attention to what I say/am interested in.

She thought that with the new baby she would be the grandma but she and my SIL don't get along that well(they don't fight but they don't have much in common either) and I guess she was feeling pretty sad.

After the post I started wondering whether my mom had been through some sort of abuse, which could explain her reaction to my dad seeing me naked and whatnot. It wasn't that.

My dad said he was a victim of sexual abuse and that it came from someone he trusted and was family, so my mom saying this made him enraged. He tried talking to her after but apparently she just kept implying it and he can't keep being married to someone who would say this.

There's more about it but that's basically what went wrong.

I'm honestly heartbroken, I can't wrap my head around what my mom did and I still feel guilty about this whole story(even more now, since it was bc of me that felt left out). I don't know what our relationship will be like, my dad has the full custody but said I could visit her anytime I want but we haven't talked yet and she hasn't tried to contact me.

My brother still talks to her but not as much, he says she is ok, he said she asks about me but I think he's lying. 

We are living with my grandma but will move to a new house next month, it seems like a cool place and is close to my brothers work.

On a happier note, SIL is almost ready for the baby and the name I suggested was the chosen one! I can't wait to meet my niece :D

"AITA for ""double-reporting"" an employee (to his boss, and then to corporate) and probably getting him fired?","My husband and I have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is African American and I am white (this will be important later on in the story). My son just got his driver's permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. The other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

I scolded my son and gave a ""sorry"" wave to the driver. At the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. His car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. He rolled down the window and shouted the N-word at my son. My son's face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. The encounter **sickened** me.

I did some research on the company; at one point I even plugged them into Facebook. They have a very active Facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. I called the company and reported the man's behavior, describing him very vividly. They informed me that they knew exactly who I was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. I had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

Two months later, when I was browsing Facebook kind of boredly one day, the company's name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it I clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. One of the very first photos/posts I saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. To my horror, I saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. Meaning they didn't fire him.

The company is part of a nationwide chain, so I called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person I could get to, and I reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn't fire him. The man I spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person I'd reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. Additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have ""no place"" and ""no future"" in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee's career is now toast.

Was it right of me to ""double-report"" this guy? I'm sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that I was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. Am I an asshole or a ""Karen"" for not dropping this matter?",AmItheAsshole
Walmart refused to let me leave with groceries I paid for,"Yesterday afternoon I 34 f took my four year old son and two year old daughter grocery shopping at Walmart in Irvine, California. I was waiting on my next paycheck, so I bought $175 worth of groceries with $300 in the bank. The cashier kept asking me to swipe my card saying the transaction did not go through. I checked my bank balance with my Wells Fargo app and found that Walmart had already charged me the $175 for groceries. I asked for a manager to come and fix the situation. Manager assured me the charge would drop off. He asked for my bank card to call my bank. He said he wanted to look at the customer service phone number, so I told him the phone number. I also called my bank. They opened a claim and said they would email me the claim number, but I checked my inbox, and I did not receive an email from them. I asked the manager to try to contact his supervisor to see if the situation could be fixed so I could leave with my groceries as Walmart had already charged me for them and with the transaction pending, I did not have enough funds available to buy more groceries. Manager refused to contact his supervisor. He said, ""he's not here."" I ended up having to leave a full cart of groceries with this manager in tears and drive to Wells Fargo to explain the situation. They told me there was nothing they could do as long as the charge was pending. They said to call them as soon as the charge went through. I called Walmart customer service and explained the situation and emailed their corporate office. This morning, the charge went through. I called Wells Fargo and let them know, and they emailed me a claim number. I also emailed Walmart customer service again. As a single working mom of two young children, $175 is a lot of money to me. That was the grocery budget I had been able to set aside for the entire month for me and the kids. What can I do to make sure I get my grocery money back?",legaladvice
My wife is done with sex and Im not ready to be celibate for the rest of my life... are we done?,"Since finishing having kids a few years ago, my (now 39yo) wife has not been interested in sex - for a long time she would go though the motions for my sake but grew to resent the ""chore"" more and more to the point where she would avoid me like the plague and we were fighting about it all the time. She swears its not me and that its not due to bad performance etc... she just doesnt want to.

We have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. No matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

Essentially...
- if I try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if I am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

Recently Ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but Im dying inside.

Is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? Or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? I dont want an affair etc, I want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

AITA for not wanting my mom to cover my daughter's chest in pictures,"My daughter is 17 months old. Being that she is a toddler, she would live in just her diaper if she could. When she's at home, we let her run free, and thus, most of our pictures are of her in just her diaper.

My mother posts a lot of my daughter's photos on facebook, which I don't mind, but she is constantly editing little heart or smiley face stickers over my daughter's nipples.

AITA for yelling at my sister in law?,"Context here: I'm an ex heroin addict. The why and how isn't important, but I got hooked at 15, tried to get clean at 17 but relapsed hard, finally got my act together and got off it for good at 21. I'm 26 now and completely clean. I don't even drink, except for on special occasions where I'll have two or three drinks at most.

Now, my older brother and his wife have been together since shortly before I had my bad relapse, and she's convinced that I'm just a ticking time bomb waiting to relapse again. The first year or so, I understood her concerns and she wasn't the only person who had them. However, it's been almost six years since I was anywhere near the stuff and she *still* won't have that I'm gonna stay clean.

She's very vocal about these concerns, too. If I get sick, she tells our entire family that she thinks I've relapsed again and I'm having withdrawals. She made a huge scene on Christmas day two years ago because I had a cold and was a bit sniffly and she decided that I must have been doing a ton of coke. If anything goes missing from any of the family's houses, she accuses me of having stolen it for drug money. I mostly just grin and bear it so as not to make waves, but recently she took it a step too far. 

I went away recently with some friends. On the first day of my trip, I dropped and broke my phone. Because she and my brother were unable to get ahold of me for a few days, she became convinced I had gone on a massive dope bender, and began telling my family and friends that she knew this to be the case. When I got home, I found myself being given an intervention and told how disappointed people were. It was kinda the straw that broke the camel's back, and I sort of flipped at my sister in law. I yelled at her, asking why the fuck she doesn't trust me and why she's so hellbent on undermining my success and believing that I'm incapable of staying clean. She got upset and told me she was only concerned for my wellbeing, but I said imo that's bullshit; at this point it's absolutely about her not having faith in me and if she feels that way she should stay the fuck out of my business. At that point  she started crying and she and my brother left. I'm being told left and right that I'm an asshole and ungrateful because she's only looking out for me and I need to apologise, but I'm still upset that she evidently believes I'm incapable of doing this.

"New Roomate is actually a family and has taken over our apartment, eating my food, dictating what i can and can't do, now they are being openly hostile towards me and i can't take this. LL won't let me out of the lease, police say it is a civil issue.","I am renting a room in Toronto for university, the apartment is shared between 3 of us, i have a lease for my room and nothing else. I moved into this place in January, and up until May it was just me and the other roommate. In April LL told us a couple (not 1 person) would be moving into the empty room. I was fine with it because i didn't care that much.

When they moved in it became instantly apparent it was not just a couple, it was a couple, 2 kids, and another man. We immediately told our landlord, and the couple would keep re-iterating they are allowed to have guests. Landlord has told them no they cannot do this as it is not safe as the unit is overcapacity, but they just have ignored him.

Those guests have now been here for over a month, our landlord is trying to evict them through the LTB. But it has left me and my roomate in an extremely shitty situation. On top of this our landlord has basically told us if he lets us ether of us out of the lease then the family will completely take over the entire apartment, and he won't be able to re-rent it.

The family eats my food, i can't leave anything outside of my locked room. Last week the father and mother got into a huge screaming argument (that i cannot understand) which led to a domestic abuse incident which terrified me, my roommate called the police and the father was removed. He came back the next day and they have been arguing and screaming every other night.

Last night i invited a friend back to my place only for the father to start screaming at me accusing me of basically being a whore and then trying forcibly force my friend out of the apartment before i called the police. The police came i explained the situation, and after a bunch of back and forth he finally let my friend enter the apartment. I broke down when explaining the whole situation to the police officer, and while he empathized with me he told me it was a domestic issue.

I am sick of this, i want out now. My roommate's lease is up at the end of August but is planning to just move into her boyfriends and just eat the cost. I don't have that luxury unfortunately, and i am terrified of how this is going to go when she is gone.

How can i break my lease? What are the penalties for breaking my lease? I offered my landlord 2 months of rent (all i can afford) and he didn't take it.",legaladvice
TIFU by sending a picture of my my sloppy poo to my evil boss and getting fired. [NSFW],"This happened on the day before Christmas Eve (the 23rd). I worked at a supermarket and as you can guess, just before Christmas the store is absolutely hectic.

So on the night before Christmas Eve Eve (22nd) I started having some pretty sloppy poos. Throughout the night this case developed into a hole shitshow of sloppy shits. I was going back and forwards to the toilet all night and only managed to get a couple hours sleep. If I'm completely honest I'm surprised I didn't soil myself and I'm actually a little bit proud of the fact that I didn't. 

When morning came my sloppy poos were still at their height and showing no resistance, I really could not muster up the courage to go into work whilst the shits were at their peak. I knew that I would not last an hour working the cash register. If I were to try it would only result in two scenarios; me either sprinting to the toilet and looking a fool or the much more likely scenario of me shitting myself in public (one of my worst fears). I picked up my phone and called in sick.

Just with my luck, my ass of a boss answered the phone. She's quite the bitch and to no surprise she was not too happy when I told her I would not be coming in. I am a good employee and from the few years of working at the store I've only had 1 or 2 days off (I very rarely get I'll), I assumed it wouldn't be too hard to get a day off. Damn i was wrong. 

She started accusing me of faking an illness  and bitching out due me not wanting to come into a work due to it being one of the busiest days of the year.  She called me lazy and told me how I'm not a ""team player"". She called me many many names (which was completely unneeded) and expressed about 50,000 times how she did not believe that I was ill and how she just knew I was lying to get the day off. She told me how she was expecting to see me In work later. The whole time I was trying to keep my cool and trying to explain to her how I in-fact did have the shits and how it would definitely not be a good idea to come into work. She still refused to believe. 

Little did she know I had just brewed up a pretty horrific poop. Still on the phone I told her calmly and gently that if she did not believe me I would simply prove it to her. 

I hung the phone up and snapped a quick picture of the ass goblin I had produced. With no hesitation I proceeded to send the picture to my boss on Facebook messenger then I and happily flushed the beast away. 

No more than a few minutes later I received a phone call from the boss where she in short told me how I was being fired. I guess she didn't really like the pic I sent her

If I'm honest I don't really care that she fired me. I was contemplating leaving anyway. She is definitely on my top five list of the biggest dicks I've met. But either way I really didn't want to get fired. 

TL;DR
I developed a pretty shitty case of diarrhoea on Christmas Eve Eve. I could not possibly have gone into work (in a supermarket). I called the super mega bitch of a boss to let her know I won't be in. She refused to believe and accused me of lying. I sent her a picture of my shit and she fired me a few minutes later.

META You can still be the asshole if you were wronged,"I've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, I've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. OP was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. Their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? And there is a resounding chorus of NTA! You don't owe anyone anything! Or someone was mean to OP, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. AITA?  No! They were rude so you get to be as well! 

I dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. Sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. These reactions are understandable. But just because its understandable doesn't mean OP can't be the asshole. 

Being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. People make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  It is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown. ""They started it"" didn't work in kindergarten and it shouldn't now.

"AITA because I ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?","What I thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and I'm up at 7:05 AM dealing with it. I figured while I wait for a text, I could post here to see if what I did was really that bad. 

I'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. I love to eat which probably borders on addiction but I figure since I'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. I have some great friends although there is no doubt I'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. I guess that sets the stage enough. 

Last night my friend hosted UFC and I was invited. He got a 6 foot party sub. I also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. Well of course people flocked to the food and I had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and I didn't get to have a single one. Which is totally fine that's why I brought them but maybe an hour later I was starving. I kept eyeing the sandwich and I'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. I waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). So I was like screw it...I took about half of what was left and ate it. Then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

Well to be sure as I was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. Like I was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. I guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. She was furious and said that I was an incredible pig and that I had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. I felt so bad I tried to explain to her that I really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. I also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share Alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

I offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. I said I was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

I woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that I had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that I embarrassed myself last night. I tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

Was I the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

Edit: I guess I've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so I can't find out why.

To answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. This is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. Its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but I can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",AmItheAsshole

"My (18M) girlfriend (F17), is threatening to kill herself every time I express discomfort, and today when I got angry at her and ignored her texts, she sent me videos of her cutting herself","I feel extremely trapped at this point. She was such a great person when I met her and I thought we would be great together.

Unfortunately, for the past month, she's started to insult me for everything. For example, I could not hear a line of what she said over FaceTime because of internet issues and she flipped saying I don't pay attention to her. Proceeded to call me names or whatnot. Usually, I just took and it moved on. However, today I just snapped and told her to leave me alone. So I proceeded to put my phone on do not disturb and I check my messages 45 minutes later to find 30+ messages that are a mix of anger, sadness. 

I just ignore it because I really did not feel like it.  Then she tells me she's bleeding into the sink and proceeds to send me a video of her doing so. I honestly think I'm traumatized from those videos, I can't seem to get them out of my head and I feel responsible for them. I texted her father, however it was late so he's asleep. Thankfully she's still alive and I've managed to calm her down by apologizing, but I don't feel right. 

I feel trapped, and very fucking sad. I feel as if I'm a monster and I'm causing her to do these things to herself. I never say anything badly to her, I just want to be left alone and it ends up like this. I apologize for my rant but I don't know. My emotions are a mix of me feeling responsible, feeling trapped and feeling regretful.

I hope I can get some advice. For some insight, I don't ever insult her, not even jokingly. She gets annoyed that I don't give her attention, but I text her and hang out with her as much as I can possibly give, I am human and a student with responsibilities, I can't spend 24 hours with her.  

That's really all. 

Update: 
Just a slight update. I have been in contact with her father and I am being updated on what's happening. They are seeking professional help for her and I feel that is the right choice for her. I am very exhausted and haven't really slept, so I'll try and give updates as I can. Fortunately, she is safe and protected by people so that she cannot do any type of self harm. In my case, I've decided it's going to do me harm if I continue keeping her in my thoughts and anywhere in my life. 

My mental state was much more positive and happy before this, and I'd much rather regain my positive nature. I am very appreciative of everyone in my messages expressing their own dealings with similar circumstances. I've read every story and the decision I made has been influenced by your own experiences. I will try and reply to all the messages, but I apologize if I miss anything. I'll keep you guys updated if anything new comes up. I have decided to move on with my life and and get therapy to help me through this, and I hope she comes to see what I chose to do a few years from now.

I always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn't have a home button. So apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. 

I realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. Since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. It wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. Its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow 


TL;DR Dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat


Update: So im not getting fired luckily. Im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. Ive heard so many Michael Jackson just beat it references its unreal. The group chat is mostly comprised of people I go to college with. Even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. My boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn't post my dick in the groupchat.  Also holy fuck this blew up! Thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.

TIFU by sending my husband to Korea,"My husband got invited to be a speaker in a conference, but it'll be in Seoul. He didn't feel like attending since he finds conferences annoying & hates long flights. But I wanted to go to Korea, and with hotel rooms and his flight paid for, it'll be a cheaper trip for me. 

Loads of whining and food bribes later, he accepted with the condition that I go to every event with him to keep him company. 

...and then I realised the conference was happening too soon for me to get a visa. I'm Indonesian, and Indonesia's not only a 3rd world country, it's the world's largest Muslim country....which means I'm always fucked traveling-wise and need a month to apply for visas to travel to most places. 

So yeah. My husband is now on a flight to Korea, alone and miserable. 

**TL;DR:** sent my husband on a trip he didn't want to go to so I can tag along. And I can't make it.

AITA for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.,"I'm(22M) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. We're very close and we have always been like that. He lives with me now obviously. He often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so I comfort him as best as I can. 

So, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. She doesn't live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. Me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn't wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. She woke us up and made a scene in front of him. She said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it's extremely concerning that he's so affectionate towards me. My brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. I brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

I went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. I told her to get the fuck out. She got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. I grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. I didn't hurt her, she was following me, I didn't use any force. She left, she called me few times but I didn't answer.


Update: thanks for all the comments. I talked to her, she still said that she didn't do anything wrong,she didn't hurt my brother and it wasn't her fault that he started crying. I broke up with her. 

Also little info: this doesn't happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. He laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.",AmItheAsshole

Public North Carolina High School. Says my son's hairstyle and color violates school's social norms. (Update: Found a way around it),"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/789wcm/public_north_carolina_high_school_says_my_sons/

I want to you all for the help and advice that you gave us. I realized that this, while stupid, is probably within the rights of the school. But that didn't mean there was nothing we could do. A lot of you brought up the idea of a using a wig. Sadly, wigs also weren't allowed except for ""legitimate religious, cultural or medical reasons with prior approval.""

However, what did surprise me was that there were two girls who were on a green dye for months without a problem. This definitely sounded like gender discrimination. Allowing that dye for girls and not boys. So I went in there to speak with the principal again, I told him that I'm recording the conversation and after speaking about wigs, told him that they're allowing girls to do that but not boys. Principal said this is a matter of judgement because unnatural hair colors doesn't diminish the feminine attributes of women, but unnatural hair colors for men does diminish their masculine attributes. I got it then, that nonsense is all this has been about. They think a long and blue hair on a boy isn't manly enough.

I reminded him that this is gender discrimination and gender is a protected class. He remained silent for more than a minute, I expected him to say it's fine and they'll backtrack but I was shocked when he told me that I'm right, they'll reinforce this requirement for girls too. ""It's best to get rid of these unnatural colors from our school.""

I hate what I did. The last thing I wanted was to cause trouble for those girls or start a chain of actions that could have ended up with them being forced to change their favorite hairstyles. They were contacted too, and were given the same choice.

Two days later my son came to me and said he's spoken with the girls and they have a solution. They want to dye their hair a very white silverish color. It's naturally occurring because you get it when you get old, and some people are born with it as well. I know the more mature thing would have been to tell him to end this game, but I was a teenager once as well and I was even more stubbern than he is now. So I allowed it.

The school didn't like it. The three of them were called to the principal's office where they argued their case that their hair color is naturally occurring now. They said it's the same color as one of the teachers who is quite old, ""are you gonna suspend Mr. X as well over his hair color?""

The principal laughed at them and backed off. It's been a couple of weeks since then and there hasn't been any issues. And this new color looks good on my son.

TIFU by ruining a joke my wife has been saving for years.,"Tomorrow I'll be turning 32.  As we were waking up this morning she asked me if I was excited for the plans we'd made for my birthday. I responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but I was looking forward to it nonetheless.

She looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. I thought she was just trying to make sense of what I had said. Instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that I ruined a joke she's been holding onto for years. I didn't believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn't forget. 

It took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. Unfortunately for her I've known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.

Made a stupid joke to my wife about my 32nd birthday only being 30 seconds long and found out she's been saving this joke to use for the past three years. Oops.

Afternoon Sex,"The only way to pull off a Sunday afternoon ""quickie"" with their 8-year-old son in the  apartment was to send him out on the balcony with a Popsicle and tell him to report on  all the neighbourhood activities.

He began his commentary as his parents put their plan into operation:
""An ambulance just drove by!""
""Looks like the Andersons have company,"" he called out.

My coworker admitted to making false reports against my ex-boyfriend to get him disqualified from becoming a police officer.,"About 6 months ago, my boyfriend was permanently disqualified during his application process to become a police officer. It was very odd as he's never had any legal trouble, he's never done drugs, there was really no reason to be disqualified. He has a criminal justice degree, he volunteered with the police department and he has background in security. The police refused to disclose why he was disqualified.

Well after hanging out with a mutual coworker, he very openly told me he was trying to ruin my boyfriends life and he filed a report saying my boyfriend threatened him and was very temperamental and aggressive and that he was scared of him. They worked together and went to highschool together. 

He then told me to make sure I told my boyfriend because he wanted to start a physical altercation in order to get him arrested. He even told my boyfriend's brother, but he didn't say anythin because he didn't want to cause a fight. 

I feel like I'm in a very bad position. Would showing the police our texts possibly get the disqualification reversed? Is there anything I can do legally? It's been about 6 months since the disqualification and I'm in arizona.

Edit: I wanted to add, his reasoning for doing this is because he wanted to also ruin our relationship because he wanted to be with me.",legaladvice

TIFU for going to the ER for sucking dick,"A couple months ago, it was date night with my bf and I was PUMPED to finally relax after a rough week. My boyfriend (who asked to be called Magnum here üôÑ üôÑso I'll refer to him as M) and I ended up making stuffed crust pizza. With grilled onions, sausage, and a fuck ton of cheese, it looks fucking amazing. So does M, so while waiting for it to bake, we head back to the bedroom to do things.

&#x200B;

After blowing him, I pulled off to swallow, but I couldn't -- my jaw was locked wide open!

&#x200B;

Super embarrassed, I ran into the bathroom to get his cum out of my mouth. It was still stuck in the back of my throat, but I couldn't swallow or spit, so I tilted my mouth forward to allow his baby gravy to slowly drip out my mouth into the sink.

&#x200B;

We try everything‚Äîforcing my jaw shut with hands, aggressively wiggling it, massaging, praying to Jesus to forgive me for my premaritial sins, but it's still stuck wide open. Trying to make a little more tolerable, I took ibuprofen with wine, dumbly forgetting I can't swallow. So there I was, choking on his semen, wine, pills, and drool uncontrollably flowing out of my mouth. To make matters worse, M eats the pizza in front of me, it smells delicious, and obviously I can't have any.

&#x200B;

At \~4am, we give up the home remedies and Uber to the ER. I attempt to explain my situation to the receptionist with my mouth wide open and drool dripping onto my shirt. She's probably like, ""why is this guy taking advantage of this poor retarded girl?"" I write down that I'm nauseous and worried I'll die from sucking dick and choking on my own vomit, and get seen pretty quickly. We end up with an audience of about \~5 other curious doctors while this guy inspects my jaw.

&#x200B;

One asks, ""How did this happen?""

Me: ...

Another doctor: ""Did you yawn?""

Me: ...uh...yeah...

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

&#x200B;

One doctor massages my neck while the other one sticks his hands into my mouth and pushes my back teeth back. It hurts like a bitch‚Äîthis guy's applying his whole body weight into my teeth and I can feel his arms shaking as he leans into me.

&#x200B;

But then!! Suddenly everything feels right again. It's all in place!!!

&#x200B;

We go home and the pizza is STILL good the next morning, and everything is okay. Well, besides having to send an ER bill home to my parents and explain that it was from dislocating my jaw :( M looked awfully smug the whole time, but I appreciated him coming w me to the ER and letting me drool all over him

&#x200B;

TLDR: Dislocated my jaw by sucking dick. I had to go to the ER at 4am, watch my bf eat the pizza we made together when I couldn't, and publicly humiliate myself

AITA for catfishing my underaged sister on Tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?,"Last week, I was using my sister Ashley's phone because mine was dead and I needed to call a friend to confirm plans. Dialing my friend's number, I saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. Immediately, I asked why she's on tinder (she's 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said ""none of your business"" 

I decided that I wanted to have a little fun with this. I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she's just swiping for fun?) so I didn't want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. To test if she was just using for fun, I decided I was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. I asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) Kevin if he'd mind if I used his pictures and explained the situation. He thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

I created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister's account. Her age was set to 19 (lie, she's still in **high school**) so I was definitely more suspicious of her now. I superliked and less than an hour later, she matched AND messaged me. 

I decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for Sunday afternoon and told her we could ""head to my place afterwards"". She was completely receptive and said she'd meet me there. She told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

After she left, I told our parents EVERYTHING and showed them all of the messages. They were pissed, and I suggested we all go to the restaurant. My dad and I just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for ""Jim"". My dad went up to her and said ""Jim's not coming"" and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. I told her that there was no Jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. My dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the Internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger's* place. We were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

I told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said I was a ""fucking dick"" and ""cruel"" to her. My other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. Wondering who's right and if I went too far?

EDIT: Yes, when I asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would've had sex with Jim. That's why I went the extent that I did.

Alright after reading all these judgments, I came to the conclusion that I'm TA. But I'm TA she needed. If anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.

She is also very quick to close any messages on her phone if I enter the room.

This evening during an intimate moment she said the name of one of her male co-workers I confronted her on this and she flatly denied saying anything at all, but I have no doubts over what I heard. 

I took her home in what felt like the longest drive of my life. As I dropped her off I said I wanted to talk about what happened she just left without saying a word.

This all happened just a few hours ago and I'm struggling to comprehend exactly what's gone on.

He calls me like an hour later and says his guy started cutting the front rotors and it wasn't gonna work so they needed to replace all 4 four 850. I asked if they cut the backs ones yet and he said no. I specially said *do not* cut the backs ones ""do as little as possible"". 

He calls me again and says his guy cut a back rotor and it wasn't gonna work so I needed to replace those too as it was too uneven now. I said I told you not to cut those and he was like ""I was just tryna to help you out""

My daughter left daycare and ran into the street and nobody noticed until a stranger found her,"(WI) Just started work for the first time since having my daughter two years ago. 

Left her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers. 

On the second day I was driving and saw her walking down the street several blocks from the daycare with a woman I had never seen before in my life. 

I jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she'd found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (I have no reason to doubt the woman's intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

I drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

I was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a Good Samaritan that I just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her.

Girlfriend was arrested w/ a DUI but blew a .06!!! Cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!,"So..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. She didn't drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. When the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). On her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. A minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. She admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

This is when it gets interesting. 

The officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. He then declared that she was drunk WITHOUT HAVING HER BLOW TO TEST HER BAC, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

THEN, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! That's below the legal limit (we are in Wyoming). And the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her BAC was. 

My question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? We have no money and probably can't afford a good lawyer. I could barely afford her bail. She is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn't deter her from pursuing her dream. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. We have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

Edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn't tell her the Miranda rights (found out he doesn't need to)


Edit: thank you all so much for the help

"This morning I (27M) found out my gf (27F) cheated on me, where to go from here?","So our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but I asked my boss if I could come in late as I had some stuff I had to do. However I went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. She gave me a key to her apartment and when I went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




As soon as I walked in she saw me and burst into tears. The guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. I freaked out at first and the guy left. She kept asking what are you doing here, I thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. I tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. Eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



I took the flowers and the gift and left. I'm sitting at work right now because if I went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





We've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. I was looking up rings. She said it's because I was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. She thought I wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. I asked if there were any others but she said no. Idk what to believe at this point. 




The kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. We had lunch and got a hotel room together. We had dinner at my place with my folks and I dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. I trusted her for fucks sake.




 How and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? What am I supposed to do from here?



TL;DR spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




*edit at roughly 1:30PM. : I broke up with her, I told her I'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. I'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.*

College applications should be completely anonymous.,"As the title says I think applications for college should be completely anonymous. They should only get your grades, test scores, extra curricular activities, etc. There is no reason for the schools to even know your gender, race, or economic background. I don't think any one applicant should be given even a fraction of an edge based off of any of those criteria. It should be 100% merit based. 

I was advised to add a little more to this but I don't really have any more to add. It's simple really, I don't understand why it is necessary for the admissions team to even know these characteristics. While obviously for many schools there are interviews, in those cases it would be anonymous up until you where offered to come in for an interview. They shouldn't even be given a name, just an application number at the top. This would combat racism, sexism, nepotism, and hopefully any other bias that might affect the application process if even by a small percent. ",unpopularopinion

TIFU playing porn for my family through the Echo on Xmas morning,"Writing this from the bathroom as I just realized what happened. 

Home for the holidays. My family got an Amazon Alexa a couple of years ago, and my parents never quite figured out how to actually make it work. It used to be set up under my account, but when I moved out last year I transferred everything to my mom. It's in the kitchen, and she mostly uses it for timers while cooking. 

Our family likes off-beat Christmas music, and I spent a while some time back curating it all on to a special Spotify playlist for us. We like to listen to it as we have brunch and open presents on Christmas morning. 

Here's where the FU starts. Yesterday I wanted to play a new song I heard for my mom. I couldn't get the Echo to find it, so I had to connect my phone via Bluetooth. The family all got new phones a month ago, so there were no devices automatically connected. I paired my phone and played the song. 

This morning, before a long day of family, small talk, presents and whatnot, I was mentally preparing myself for the day in my childhood bed. You know, relieving some stress.... with videos. Oddly enough none of the videos I stumbled upon had sound. I wrote it off as shoddy sources and finished the deed. 

When I came downstairs to say good morning and merry Christmas to the family, my sister greets me with ""you need to play the playlist from your phone, I can't get the Echo to connect to my phone."" ""Okay, no problem, I'll connect my phone."" ""I was trying to connect mine, and I think yours is already connected.""

Not sure what my family heard playing over the Echo this morning, but it wasn't my usual Christmas playlist. 

tl;dr paired my new phone to my family's Echo yesterday. Went to tug one out this morning in my childhood bed, and I'm pretty sure that soundtrack blasted in the kitchen for my family. ",tifu

"New York - I've been visited by CPS 8 times, to enquire about a child I don't have. At what point it becomes harassment or stalking?","There's a CPS agent that seems to be convinced that I have a child and I'm locking the child in my home. First time I was visited, I was very understanding. I allowed her to search my house without any restrictions. Everything seemed fine. Obviously no child and no evidence of one, because I don't have a child.

This was repeated 4 times in about 2 months by the same agent, until I stopped cooperating. I told her that from now on the only way I'm going to allow access to my property will be with a search warrant. A few weeks later, she came with a police officer, without a search warrant. The officer told me that it will be a lot easier if I allowed them to look at my house, I allowed the officer to do that by himself. Again, no child was found. His search was very thorough, looking for hidden basements or doors in walls or something like that. 

Two more times she has visited me to talk about my child and these times I have refused to talk to her. Once, as I left home to go to work she was there to ask me questions. It definitely looked like she was waiting right outside my house to get a hold of me. I called the police but it went nowhere. I have called the CPS office in my area 4 times to file a complaint but they go nowhere. This last incident happened this last Thursday.

This woman has contacted my neighbors, my brother and sister, my coworkers and my employer already. Everyone has told her that I don't have a child. 

This definitely seems like a personal obsession on the part of the agent. If this was a legitimate CPS operation with reasonable evidence for what they're claiming, I'm sure they could get warrants after all this time and even put me under surveillance I guess? But they've made no efforts to do anything as far as my complaints have gone. So maybe her superiors are in on it, or at least don't care at all.

This is really going too far and is affecting my life. I actually fear for my safety now. I will install security cameras this week and will call the police if I found her waiting around my house but they don't seem to care because she's with the CPS.

Do I have a legal recourse here? Like filing a restraining order against the CPS (or against her), or maybe informing some different authorities to press charges for stalking? This definitely seems like it, at least in the layman's definition of the term. Not sure how stalking is defined legally. What's the best way to stop her?

TIFU being on my period and getting drunk,"So like the title said I fucked up (it was after midnight so technicly today) by having my period and getting drunk.
If your one of those guys who nearly faints when someone mentions the word period, this post aint for you, It will fuck up your life.

My son's birthday was yesterday, so I've been running around all day catering everybody and making sure the kids don't break anything/eachother. Somewhere around noon I noticed my period got heavy and I put in a tampon, and went back to my guests.

Around 7 o'clock everyone left except my husband's best friend, I put the kids to bed and started to relax. I've had a wine or 2 during the day, and now with my kids in bed I treated myself to a glass of wine, and during the evening my husband and I got pretty wasted (which for my was kinda easy cos I hadnt had a drink in like 2 weeks). 
Around 11 my husband went to bed because he got tired and pretty bored with me and his friend because we where talking about games, watching trailers, that kind of stuff. And since I've got no gamer friends I had a good time, getting drunker by the minute. Around 00.30 husbands friend decides to go home. 

This is where my FU begins.

I was pretty drunk, and drunk me tought sexytime with husband was a good idea (cos let's face it, drunk sexytime is the best sexytime). But then I realised I still had my tampon in, so I had to get it out (also because it's dangerous to have it in for as long as I unknowingly had, but most because of my desired sexytime). 

I went to the toilet, ready to pull it out, when I realised I couldnt ""find"" it, or the string. After some fumbling around I could feel al little bit of the string, alllllll the way tucked in. I spend about 15 minutes grabbing the string, trying to pull it out, only to feel like it was stuck, and I couldnt get a good grip at it. 
I was getting annoyed at this point, fingering myself on the toilet in search of The Lost Tampon wasn't the kind of sexytime I had in mind. 

I decided to call the HAP (I live in Holland, here we dont go to the ER for everything, we go to out ""homedoctor"" for small things like a cold, bump on the head, vaccinations, deep cut and so on. But outside working hours there is the HAP which is like the on duty doctor/ nurse for like 50 doctors in the area). 

Trying to sound kinda sober I explained the nurse my problem, she was kind but firm, If I didnt get the fucker out in an hour, I had to come by and they would extract it. If I would wait till morning I would have it in for 20 hours and that is dangerous.  That would mean I would have to wake-up my husband not for sexytime but for I fucked up time, and we would have to get the kids out of bed.
I wasnt gonna let that happen (primerely because Im the hilarious one in our relationship, and I wasn't ready to hear ""yo pussy so big, tampons get lost"" jokes for the rest of my life). 

So before this moment I was a woman on a mission, now I was Frodo trying to get this tampon out of Sauromons grip. 

Nurse mentioned trying to squad or take a relaxing shower. 

So here I was squatting in the shower with my hand in the depths of Erebor. Still not getting good enough grip. So I take the showerhead put the waterstream on 10 and try to flush this white torpedo out. Guess what, didnt work... this goes on like 15 minutes, time is getting scarce. 

Decide to lean agains the wall squatting, and I finally have the string between the tips of my thumb and indexfinger. I AM NOT LETTING GO NOW! While I pull gentely I push like I'm in labour, and what do you think, I finally pulled the fucker out! 

I felt extatic, leaned against the wall again in relieve, feeling proud about my victory.. sexytime here I come! 

Before I leave to shower I decide to take a closer look at the fucker, wondering why It took longer for me to give birth to this annoying bugger than with my youngest son.

I look at it, lying in the corner.. and my mind goes blank for a minute... then I scream.. I would't have flipped out more if it was the wormy thing from Alien..
...Then the realisation kicked in.. 

I.PULLED.OUT.MY.FUCKING.IUD...  insert drunken hyperventilation.. OMG I pulled out my IUD.. It was just lying there in the corner like some aborted metal fishook al bloody and gross..

If you think my FU ends here.. think again.. Keep in mind it's around 2/3 o'clock now.

In my panic I decide to call my mom (waking-up husband isn't nessesary annymore couse sexytime is off the table!). My father answers the phone all sleepy, and I ask for my mom. ""Well sweatie, we were sleeping, whatever it is, I can help you, no need to wake your mother."" Okay... 

IWantedToHaveSexytimeWithHusbandButImHavingMyPeriodITouhgtICouldntGetMyTamponOutButNowIPulledOutMyIUD... HELPPPPP!!!!  ""......""  Daddy?  ""......"" ""M. WAKE UP YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU!"" 

So now I explained to my mother what happend and she managed to calm me down, and said I needed to call the HAP again. 
So I did, got the same nurse, explained what happend. She consulted with her collegue, and asked me some additional questions to find out if Im ok√©.. 

""Ma'am, are you shivvering?"" Yes I am. ""Can you decribe how bad?"" Well I was in the shower, and now I'm standing in my bathroom all naked and wet for like 15 minutes now, so I'm getting kinda cold. 
""Okay, thats a good explanation, are you dizzy ma'am?"" Yes I am dizzy. ""Can you decribe how dizzy?"" Well I drank like a bottle of wine, thats how dizzy I am.(Muffled laughter on the other end of the phone) ""Well I guess thats okay also than. Are you bleeding down there?"" Yes I am. ""Okay sweety how bad is it?"" Well I'm heaving my period, that is how bad it is.. ""Oh yeah, I forgot, so that is normal also than."" 

She suggested to go to bed, and if I felt worse I could stop by, the fact that I pulled out my IUD wasn't so different than when I would get it removed by a nurse, altough she tought that that ""would have happend more gently"" (no shit Sherlock).

There is still the mistery of The Lost Tampon.. I think drunk me pulled it out earlier at night, but I have no clue.

So for not letting go drunken sexytime, I'm now not gonna have sexytime for a few weeks till I get a new IUD. And because I didn't want to hear ""Yo pussy so big"" jokes, now I'm gonna hear ""Remember when you got so drunk and horny you pulled out your IUD"" jokes forever. Not to mention my parents now know I like drunken sexytime.. So yeah I fucked up today..

TL;DR

Today I fucked up being on my period, getting drunk, and wanting sexytime. Mistake my IUD for my tampon, ripped it out after a 2 hour struggle, and woke up my parents to tell them I fucked up because I wanted to have dunken sexytime with husband. I did not get sexytime, nor will I get it for a few weeks.

Edit: Wow this really blew up after I went to sleep! Glad to see my drunken efforts brought so much laughter! And its kinda nice to see al the shocked reactions, makes me feel a little less dumb for calling for my mommy in the middle of the night! 

Some aditional info as requested:

- A IUD is a form of birtcontrol, its like a 2cm big T shaped metal thingy which is placed in your uterus, on the bottom of the T is a little string that sticks out your uterus alllll the way up your vagina, so that they can remove it. 

- No thank God it didnt hurt (dont know if that was the wine of the fact that I gave birth to to kids)

- Yes my funzone is (apart from some trust issues) okay!

- Yes I'm fullt aware now that I didnt have to tell my parents I wanted sexytime, but drunken and horrified me couldnt care less at that moment.

- I'm 32 year old grown up mother of 2, and yes I called for my mommy

- I could have asked husband to remove The Lost Tampon, but I figured after that sexytime wouldnt be an option for him, and since that was the goal I didnt ask him. (Thank God, cause this would have scarred him for life!)

- As for The Lost Tampon.. I have no idea, I must have drunkenly removed it earlier.. else it still dwells in the depths of Erebor

Thanks for al the support, shocked reactions, compliments, laughter, silver, gold AND platinum! This made my FU a little less embarrasing!",tifu

"Was I sexually assaulted? If so, what should I do?","For the past couple of months, I've been working in a restaurant. There's this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she's looking through my social media profiles, won't stop snapping me or Facebooking me, I've since deleted her Snapchat and blocked her on Facebook. 

Anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. I moved my arm away to which she responded ""don't you like to be touched?"" to which I responded ""not by you"". So she went to kick me in the balls but I moved out of the way and said ""no chance"". 

As we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. She moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which I pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. She said ""I'm only joking"" before trying to do it again IN FUCKING PLAIN SIGHT OF THE OTHERS. I told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. All the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. The manager wasn't present during this.

Anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said ""dude, isn't that basically sexual assault?"" I responded ""is it?"" He said ""man, she literally molested you and tried again"" 

Honestly, I don't know what to think. I am contemplating telling the manager but I feel she'll laugh it off and class it as a joke because I'm a man. And no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn't taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. Just think of it, if I had done that, I'd be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case.

Update: They're taking my child,"So I figured it would be appropriate to do a follow-up post, since my original message had so much support and love. 

Original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7er15w/theyre_taking_my_child/). 

I haven't heard from my kid since the service for my wife. 

I spoke with my family attorney, and he said that the state of Kentucky passed laws a few years ago that essentially reinforce the concept that the step-parent has no laws, rules, policies, or anything at all in the family dynamic. So, I'm fucked. 

We've tried to be amicable to the father. I've called, texted, no answer and no response. He came by the day after the service to get her school bag, a pair of shoes, and a doll her mother got her. And since that point, no contact. I'm going to keep trying, reaching out to the various family members on his side trying to get him to even pick up the phone, let alone talk to me. 

As for the legacy of my wife, I'm taking what remains of the life insurance policy after the payout for the service, and putting it into my kid's college account. Anything left in my wife's checking account is going to a custodial account for my kid, so that when she turns 16/17 and starts looking at a car, she has a down-payment for something that's safe. 

And then we just endure. 

Thanks to everyone that gave me a sense of hope, your well wishes, and any attempts at trying to help me through this horrible time. ",legaladvice

I will try to be as detailed as possible. I have had quite a few PM's regarding what happened and I got such a big amount of responses (both positive and negative) which i never imagined would have happened. I want to let you all know that the support I have received has been incredible (both in PM and on the post itself) which has helped me in taking my decision.

I am also sorry for not being able to respond to all the PM's, theres just too many to respond to but I would like to throw out much love for all of you who took the time.

I would also like to give a big thanks on my post to everyone who replied, I tried to respond but I noticed the thread was closed (i still dont know why mods close it) but I still want to give a big thanks to the people who took the time to give me advice. Much love to you all.

I basically left in the morning to take a smoke, my head was still messed up but reading all the comments on reddit helped me. I cant remember who, but there was one guy who said the positive thing about all of this is that I found out BEFORE i got married, with no children or attachments. I still dont think she cheated other than this night, nothing i found indicated anything else, I guess she wanted this to be her ""last night"" before settling down or soemthing, I honestly dont know and dont care.

When I was outside taking a smoke, about 15-20 minutes or something after I left reddit, she had woken up. She noticed the drinks out and asked me what I had been up to, basically came to give me a kiss and a hug. I followed through with it but honestly felt empty doing it, I didnt want to give her any hint of what I knew. She asked my why I had been drinking and why I didnt come to sleep last night and I told her I was just having some nightmares but everything was fine. I felt detached, like I was watching myself in third person through a tv or something.

She asked me if any stress was related to the marriage and the plans, i just told her something along the lines of ""you know i love you, there is no stress i have for the marriage, how can you be stressed about the best thing in your life"". She got herself done and left for work.

I basically started packing my most important things, my desktop, computer, most clothes and some other things. I planned on leaving things like furniture, TV and other things I really dont care about more than getting the fuck out. I just took the stuff most important to me so that I dont have to return here again. I dont care if she gets the rest. All in all my stuff added up to about 3 or 4 suitcases i would say (desktop not included in this).

I called and cancelled the venue we were supposed to be having the wedding at, apparently they take 15 &#37; of the money for cancelling so early on because we were having such a big event, i told them its fine and I really dont care at this point.

I also saved screenshots of everything and have taken them with me.

Around 1 pm I called a taxi and went to stay at a hotel around 100 km far from my city. I didnt leave any note or pictures at home, I just left. I am planning on leaving to stay with a really really close friend who lives in a town about 300 km away, but i just needed the alone time in the hotel for some time to think everything through and process whats happened.

Around 3:30 pm my phone starts getting spammed with calls from my ex-fiance. around 3:50 I start getting calls and messages from her sister, her friends, her parents, my parents and a few of our mutual friends.

The only person I called back was my dad and mom. I have a huge trust for my parents, I basically spilled the beans and told them a nicer story about what happened, asked my dad to not say anything and also asked my mother not to say anything. I told them its ended, and that I wont be getting married no more. I also told them not to tell anything to anyone about what I told them, I trust them alot so I am sure they wont say anything. I didnt tell them exactly what happened, just that I found out she wasnt being loyal to me, i didnt think giving details would help in anyway.

Around 5 pm my dad calls mee back and is telling me my ex-fiance is completely hysterical and has basically broken down completely not understanding what is going on. I just told my dad not to intervene and that I need some alone time now.

I basically just shut my phone down and have been staying silent ever since, like a ghost. Been sleeping for a little, went to the pool here at the hotel and have just been taking it easy.

I dont know if I should respond to them now or wait some more? Her sister knew about what happened at the bachelorette party ( i have the texts to prove it, she even laughed about it and told her not to feel guilty, because its her bachelorette and that women should go all in on this night). I am seriously considering replying with to the sister, with just an image of the conversation where she is telling her this.

Once again, thank you to everyone who replied. I will update this post 1 or 2 more times and then perhaps go silent for a while, I know you are only aloud to do 1 update on relationships section. I hope this post wont get closed (still dont know why the last one did).

Time here is 10 pm soon.

TL;DR Found out my fiance cheated and I left without saying anything. Not 100&#37; sure what to say or to at this point...

EDIT 1:  since i still gett messages asking what happened i will leave this edit here. yes i did send the with proof to her sister (the part where the sister is talking about it) to her sister. i have since not received any call or message from the sister. my phone is still blowing up with calls and messages from the ex-fiance. havent read them though, yet. thinking of answering or something but i dont know what to say or do. might make another post later today so i can update you with what happened.

EDIT 2: Thanks once more for all support, sorry i havent updated, alot of things have happened and im too exhausted to write it all out today. I will head to sleep and try to update tomorrow morning with a new post. once again thanks for all support and all comments and feedback, i never believed i could have a community help me in such a big way. I might go for a vacation or something, dont know yet... i will just shortly explain that i really feel like neo in the matrix dodging bullets in slomo, however instead of dodging bullets i have dodged a slut wife, unwanted children with this wife, endless of fights and ton of depression. I honestly feel alot better knowing my life will get better. 
Shortly said about her, she has broken down and is begging me to take her back, so is her sister and friends. they also come up with the most retarded excuse of what actually happened (i dont believe them for 2 seconds) and much more... will let you all know tomorrow, going to crash now im mentally exhausted.",relationship_advice

Hospital gave my Mom's jewelry to another patient.,"My mom, (84 y/o) recently suffered a stroke and was in ICU for 3 weeks. She went in wearing her wedding ring a diamond/24ct gold bracelet and other gold jewelry. (Approx $4000 worth of jewelry). The hospital staff gave my dad (86 y/o) a bag with her personal items in it. My dad suffers from dementia and is not fully mentally there. When one of my sister's took a look inside the bag, (which was a few days later), she noticed that there was a separate bag for the jewelry but this bag did not have my mom's name on it it had a different person's name on it and it was cheap costume jewelry. 

&#x200B;

We notified the hospital and gave them the jewelry that did not belong to my mom and asked what they were going to do about her jewelry. We were told that the only thing they can do is wait to see if the person it was given to returns it, if they do then the hospital will notify us, if not then they were not going to take any further action. 

&#x200B;

One option my mom can do is file a claim with her Home Owner's carrier, unfortunately she has jewelry limitation of $1000 and none of her jewelry was scheduled so she would be out the amount over the limit. We have filed a police report but they aren't going to do anything about it, we just filed it for insurance purposes. 

&#x200B;

This happened in Washington State. I'm not sure what else we can do. My mom still cannot speak or write so she can't give any sort of statement. She is cognitive though, enough to know that her jewelry is gone.",legaladvice

#That ""Half Blurred Nude"" everyone's talking about is Rick Astley. Please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#The other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. Please read the post before commenting.

So a couple things have happened in the last few days, and I figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

First, I'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. He is just as much a victim of a crime as I am, if not more. This has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. He is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

It's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

I spoke to a lawyer...and my Dad. The lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **If** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

Anyways. Monday, I got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. The first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". She would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

In my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *Fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. It also matters that there are two victims.

The police spoke to the people whose names I provided, most of which confirmed that Sarah had shared the photos. They'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

That all made both me and John happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(All of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

So I turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. I spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. Then I paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""UNDER CONSTRUCTION"". Then I registered John and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""CONTENT PENDING COPYRIGHTS"".

THEN. I posted on Facebook.

""Recently, someone I consider a friend broke into John's phone and stole images. She then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

Not only am I disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed John in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. This person DID NOT come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

Had I ACTUALLY been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. How horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

In actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""Stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

Most of you know me as an entrepreneur; I own a small business, I pick up freelance jobs, I dabble in several money making ventures. None of this is a consistent income, so John and I have been brainstorming on how I could possibly generate a passive income. 

So we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. We had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and John's name was dragged through the dirt.

Shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

Because of this person and ALL who participated, I have had to out John and myself as sex workers. I've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn DAD. Shame on all of you.

From this point on, any person sharing these COPYRIGHTED images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

If anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

Thank you.""

Since then, I've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on Facebook.

Sarah tried to call but I hit ignore and texted her, ""You may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. She hasn't responded.

All in all, I'd say that things are looking up. Sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. John's name is clear legally. Important people in my life know that I'm not being abused. 

People are reaching out to John to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

So that's good, I guess.

I want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

Edit: To everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

I submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

Y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. I wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

I was, an still am, angry. So I got shit done.

*Edit edit*: **I am not releasing the videos.**

**Another Edit**: Since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, [this is where I got my information](https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#Final Edit:

This is getting out of hand so I'll be logging off. People asked for an update, so they got it.

Copied from a comment I posted:

Nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting Sarah arrested.

My lawyer told me that, no, John could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, I could go ahead and post on Facebook to try to control the narrative. 

He *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. As of now, I've achieved everything I wished to do. The police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

I don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",relationship_advice

So after flip-flopping about the issue a lot, I decided to just tell my husband (in a non demanding and non accusatory way as adviced by reddit) and honestly he was so understanding and wonderful about it that I now wonder why I was ever worried. He reassured me that I wasn't a horrible person and that he still loved me and that I just had a little problem that I needed help with. We're now looking for a good therapist for me. Already seen one, going to see two more before deciding which one is best for me and take it from there. I can't wait to work through this so I don't have to feel the way I do or at least know how to deal with those feelings better.

Thanks to everyone who gave me advice before :)

Edit: Thanks everyone for your kind words! Reading these wonderful comments really made my day. Honestly I didn't expect this to get so much attention, I was just very excited and felt like telling someone, anyone :)  Even though I cannot reply to all these lovely messages, I truly appreciate them.

"TSA detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the ER and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.","I'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

My father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a [port](https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/CDR756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  We came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (New York) facing the customer directly at our shop. They sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. I'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. However, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

Today, they were flying from TN (I don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to Houston, TX, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   He had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (Brooklyn, NY) and in Texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which I will request from his doctors tomorrow)  He also brings a printout from the TSA about traveling with a port and cancer which I will find the exact link to when I get more info.  

My parents arrive 3:45 to a Tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
Both parents have TSA pre and get on line at about 4. They are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  The agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the ID, etc.  My father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. Meanwhile I assume he is not speaking his best English, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. I'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which I think adds to the confusion. They wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. They don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

Both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  They go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   My father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  He calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  He tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (His first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) They take him into a small room away from my mother. He is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  The agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. The agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  My father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  I have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. He couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

He tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) The agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   The agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. My father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  They bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  They wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  They agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  They take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. He asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. By this point the plane has left.  They go to the ER to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

He has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  My father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  Port is OK but they want to check him out again before flying.

I would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. If he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  Can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? They have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. I am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so I have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that I can go over with her later, so I'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
My family is very quiet, I don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  I would if that is the only option, however.  I don't know if it's relevant that we are Muslim, either, I assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  My father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  He doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  I would love some advice.  Apologies for length.

[Update] I'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.,"Hey folks.

In proper internetiquette, I'd like to first say thank you to the community for your incredible response to what was a really bad day. I received so much support, constructive criticism, advice, and just genuine human connection. Your concern, discernment, thoughtfulness... this is one of the best reasons for the internet to exist. Even your scorn, some of you. I'm a big believer in ripping off the band-aid, and ya'll really let me have it. But when I said before that I wanted to take all of it in, I meant it. I intend to walk away from this situation a better person than before. tl;dr at bottom.

To the meat and potatoes: **I got my money back.** It wasn't as difficult as some of you feared. It was a simple text exchange yesterday, no heavy words. I also got a thank you from the newlyweds separately. I was surprised by the Bride, but I welcomed it. You should welcome all positivity. I said my congratulations again and moved on with my life. I feel like, thanks to you all, I explored every thread in the tapestry of how I should feel and what I could say. It brought a well-measuredness to my thinking that otherwise would have taken maybe months to come by. You saved me from miles of tortured internal dialogue during my daily commute. You saved me from rash actions and words I wouldn't have been able to take back.

I know some of you will wish I went off. But I want peace, and what's the metaphor? Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity? I just don't need that kind of negativity in my life and what I'm trying to say is, I know now that I was just as responsible for how terrible an experience I had. This isn't a self-blame thing, I'm not being low-self esteem. The fact of the matter is, I could have said no, and I could have established a pattern of saying ""no"" to things prior to this that would not have led me to being treated the way I was treated. From so many of you I've learned that this is called self-worth. Self-worth would not have seen me say endlessly, ""sure.""

Don't get me wrong. I still 100% believe that if someone asks you to do something on their wedding day that you can do without undue burden to yourself, you should do that thing. It's their wedding day. And this goes double for people you're very close to. But you should also know your own limits, and you should teach those limits to others in how you allow yourself to be treated. And yeah, I accept that some of the things asked of me that day, in the context of being very close friends, seemed really shitty, and it felt that way. But from the moment the last groomsmen invitation went out, I should have reassessed the relationship. Measured my value without the context of Groom's friendship and focused on that.

I think part of the reason why I took so much on was to prove that, even in the face of being called unworthy, I could stand tall as the good friend and person I know I am. Maybe some small part of me thought I could prove to the Bride that I was someone she should have always counted on. Show the Groom how a groomsmen should be. This was foolish in a lot of ways, and it ended up costing me all of this torment. You should do good things not to prove a point, but because it adds value to the world. This can be done in a way that doesn't eat you from the inside. I know this now.

So what's the plan from here vis-a-vis my relationship with my friend? I think he made that clear. If I was so important to Groom, I'd have been by his side that day, but I'm not so important, and so I wasn't. This is fine. It was his decision, and I told him myself the day he told me I was originally on the roster, ""no matter what anyone says, you need to choose the people who will get you down that aisle."" It's not the place of anyone else to judge his choices. Certainly not me. Not anymore. Ultimately, this means I maintain a respectful distance, but will emphasize the distance. I have no intention of chasing after others to be in my life. When you find the right people, there is no chase. And one day, I'll let him know why he's the usher at my wedding. I don't think that's vindictive more than it is reciprocation. We won't have hella cursive name cards.

I want to impress upon you, if you are still reading this, that you have been part of my evolution. I was already in a place of growth and recovery and building, and god damn if this experience and your input wasn't a hell of a step towards becoming a better me. I'm not going to be a doormat, but I'm also not going to be fucking heartless. If people need help and I can help, I will. I'll just love myself better by knowing when to stop. I know that I'm a good friend, and a great person, and I'm not going to let my mistakes, or anyone else's, change that.

I know that I still have my problems and I'm working through them, and if, when reading my experience, you felt a bit of yourself in me, I want to encourage you: I used to be so self-conscious about myself, I'd sit down with my knees pressed inward and and my arms crossed tight because I didn't want anyone to notice how much space my fatness took up. I used to think that the only reason women smiled at me was because they were politely hoping I'd go away. I used to think that, to have friends and be accepted, you had to give them every bit of value you possess. I'm not that guy anymore, even if the wedding proved that I still have old tendencies, and if you're going through something like this, you can change, too.

I mentioned I was always an overweight person, but I should also say that I've lost 122lbs to date and I'm going to keep going (my goal is another 50lbs). At my average weekly rate, I'll hit my goal in less than six months. If you're struggling similarly, I want you to know that you can do it (DM for emotional weight loss support, please no essential oil pitches). Also, this was supposed to be a thing where I counterpoint each of the previously stated insecurities in the above paragraph with some stark successes, but tbh women I'm in to still don't seem romantically interested in me, or I can't tell if they are (DM your relationship tips on how to figure this mystery out), but I'm not so insecure about it anymore. I know that when women smile at me, it's because I made a really bad pun and their better senses betrayed the smile. Finally, and this is key, I know who my friends are, and I know that I never had to do anything but be my fucking self and they'd gravitate towards me (you might be thinking of a fat joke here, don't). I know that my real friends asked why I was working the wedding. They asked not why, but how in the hell wasn't I the best man, let alone not be in the wedding party. They tried to get me to stand up and dance when they noticed I was down. They invited me in to pictures. They said they wished I'd had a better time. They commiserated with me the morning after the wedding. They told me, in no uncertain words, that they appreciated how I go above and beyond for people. They told me that, at some point, I have to ask myself if doing this was worth overspending myself. Focus on these kinds of people in your life.

You'll have your lingering questions about this. I'm sorry that this post became more of a introspective reflection rather than going in to more details about the wedding drama, of which, naturally, there was no shortage. If you have more questions, ask them and I'll answer. If you have more advice, I'm all ears.

I just want to close with this: so many of you offered to be my friend, and I want to live up to that. The heaviness I felt was lifted, message by message, in your every positive thought and shared painful experience. You helped me feel not alone. I want this to be the standard for everyone moving forward. Please, treat each other like good friends. If you are ever down, if you ever want advice, if you need to hear an embarrassing life story to bring levity to your situation (my life story is filled with movie-level embarrassment) please DM this account. I'm here for you.

&#x200B;

tl;dr I got my money back, I learned a thing or two, I'm your friend.

My Daughter Disowned my Underage Grandson. What do I do?,"I posted in r/JustNoFamily and was told to post here for better advice on what to do in this situation. 


My sixteen-year-old grandson was kicked out by his mother because he came out of the closet. He travelled by bus to my doorstep, two states over from where he lives. I found out the whole thing from him this morning which was the first I'm hearing about it. 


I phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. She said some very nasty things. I honestly thought I raised her better than to act in such a manner. But my grandson doesn't want to go back home, I'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but I want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible.

"[UPDATE] Mom had an affair 18 years ago, I [18M] am the product of it. My dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.","The reaction to my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

I am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

Unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and I am still processing it.

I did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and I know where I now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

I am not sure I would have had the courage to say what I had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

I think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. It makes me uncomfortable knowing I am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. A lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

I have so far went through 40% (I estimate) of the comments, but I have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

The conclusion is that I am definitely going to college, it will be the college I have always wanted to go to, and I will have the same experience as my siblings. The money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

Even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

What started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then I showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

My parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when I came back pregnant"", or something like that, I was not there, this is what she told me. I guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision I ever made"" or something like that. And their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

Yeah, it went downhill from there fast. Shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here I am.

Dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

I did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. My brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

My grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, I guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

Reading the comments was a mind opening experience. I felt unprepared for the world out there. Many have asked how I had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. Well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. Of course I knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

I went from ""I am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and I will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

Others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. For me it was a sudden change in reality.

Going through the comments I managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. Really good stuff that I think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

My parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and I haven't even read all comments. I can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

Dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. I understand his reaction, but I still feel hurt by it. I understand he was not in the best place of mind, but I can't control my feelings either. We will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

Mom hasn't handled everything that well. But she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

When mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. Mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. He kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. So my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (I am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). Mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

The man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. Dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. He was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, I guess he had more important things to do. But it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

And I don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. I thought about the matter the last two weeks, since I've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if I have other siblings out there.

I was suggested to go and buy a DNA kit from 23andme, maybe I can find him that way, but I think I will avoid doing this specifically so I don't find him or he finds me. As far as I care, I have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

Moving forward I do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like I would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

My mom admits I've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

I did learn where I stand with my family, and it's safe to say that I am loved, and I have options. I thought I am isolated, but my world is wider than I thought. Grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

I think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, I think I will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

Thank you.

WIBTA if I tell my sick wife that I have decided to take a vacation because she did the same to me when I had an accident?,"A couple of years ago, I was in a life threatening accident. I was really lucky and I made it alive. My wife and I planned a vacation just before that. And she decided to take her best friend on the vacation while I was in the hospital. That was a week long trip to Greece. 

She came back after a week and did not stop talking about how amazing the vacation was. Apparently she did that to help me vicariously enjoy the vacation. I was really pissed. My sister and my family supported me. But my wife did not. She later told me that she was too  stressed and depressed to be around me and watch me suffer. 

Now, my wife is down with flu. And I've been helping her. But I think I should help her vicariously enjoy Europe because it's one of her favorite destinations. I just want her to know how I felt. Of course, I won't go, but I plan on acting like I did. When I told my sister this, she told me that I should not get back at her and forgive her and lead by example. I don't think so. I think I'm feeling the stress now. WIBTA here?

On the other hand, if you use the phrase ""My understanding was..."", it has a way more positive connotation. Plus people will just view it as you made a slight mistake in understanding, and will be far kinder to you.

Charged $750 for a negative review,"Hi all! My parents recently just took a vacation to Key West, Florida. While there, they paid to take an hour and a half jet ski tour. While on this tour, the tour guide sped through and it ended up only being a 50 minute tour. She told the tour guide about their displeasure with the tour, speeding through and not being able to see as they sped through, and the tour guide was very rude and dismissed them. My mom took to Trip Advisor, Yelp, and Google to leave a negative review about their experience with the tour company. The next day they were charged $750 by the company, my mother called, and was told by the owner that they were charged the $750 due to leaving negative reviews which was slandering their company and then proceeded to hang up. 

Is there anything they can do? My parents reported it to their bank as fraud, the bank said it wasn't considered fraud and that it was a dispute. The local police also were no help when called. 

Since this situation occurred, the company owner has used my mother's Facebook pictures and shared them all over Facebook, with messages saying she was extremely drunk, and didn't know what she was talking about. (If she was drunk why would you let someone on your jet skis? Is that not a liability? üôÑ


My father then called, threatening a lawyer and the money was eventually refunded. 

I just wonder how much these people have made off of people leaving negative reviews about their company. Is this legal? Can you be charged for leaving a negative review? I've never heard of such a thing. 
Thanks in advance!


EDIT: Thanks all for the help and support! Everyone has been super helpful and has given a lot of great advice! I've been getting a lot of messages asking for the company's name, and I'm not sure legally I can do that or what the company could do for me giving out their name.

TIFU By Farting During Mass and Making the Priest Laugh,"This actually happened about an hour ago. I'm just now starting to come out of my humiliating shock.

So...I'm sitting at mass listening to the reading when I feel a slight grumble in my stomach,

""uh oh...gas.""

No biggie, this has happened before, I'll either wait for a song and let it go or wait for the homily (sermon for you protestants) and sneak over into the bathroom and take care of business. But alas, my body had other plans.

We stood to chant the psalm, the pressure is building, I'm starting to panic, not sure if I can hold it. We finish the psalm and the church goes to sit and just as I land on the pew...

IT HAPPENED!

Now this wasn't a quick fart, it was one of those that lasted a few seconds, a cheek rumbler, and the sound was amplified by the solid oak pew. It created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as Gabriel's trumpet.

The church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, I looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. At this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...

The priest stands up at his chair, says ""I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I can't..."" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, I can hear him laughing.

At this point I decide it's a total loss, I shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.

TL;DR  Farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now I gotta find another church. ",tifu

My friend [F19] invited me [M19] to play golf and had her boyfriend control a vibrator inside of her,"This happened yesterday. To give a bit of background, I work at a golf course and a girl I had known for years but never been friends with started working at the course. We ended up becoming really good friends and we both looked forwards to shifts together.

The other day she invited me out to play golf with her and another girl from work. I thought it sounded fun so I said yes. The day of, the plan changed and she was now bringing her boyfriend and the other girl was bringing a friend. The course only allows groups of four to go out so she told me to come with her and her boyfriend. I thought that would be fine, but going into it I was hoping this wouldn't be a third wheel situation.

  


We got to the first tee box after stocking up on drinks and immediately I noticed her boyfriend had a sleek black remote in his hand. When she got up to use her driver, she was clutching her groin and telling her boyfriend to stop while she was driving as her boyfriend was laughing. I think I caught on almost immediately as I knew she is a very sexual person, and I know remote control vibrators exist. I was in disbelief and kept playing. This continued to happen for about 8 holes of golf until by the 9th she claimed to have turned it off. It was almost constant throughout the whole round, with them discussing different levels and stuff on the remote. The whole thing was done right in front of me and very obviously, I pretended I didn't know what was going on as it was incredibly uncomfortable. Luckily by the 9th hole we had ran out of balls and had to call it. They drove me home and I left the car thinking that was one of the weirdest, most inconsiderate things someone has done to/around me.

  


Flashforward to today when I'm at work till 3 and she started at 1. It was at work that I realized how fucked up the whole situation was, and how she thought that it would okay to do that around me. When she showed up to work I was pretty cold, only really saying the bare minimum, whereas normally we would be talking a whole lot. After a bit, she asked me if something was wrong. She was was asking if something happened this morning or today, as if she thought I hadn't picked up on what had happened. I told her that golfing with her and her boyfriend was really weird. She asked what happened, and I told her ""I'm pretty sure you know what happened"". She still didn't fill in the blanks, until I mentioned the remote. At which point she said something along the lines of ""I'm sorry if that made you uncomfortable, I don't I don't know why I agreed to that, I don't know what else to say"". I asked her why she would tell me to golf with her boyfriend and her if she planned on doing that, and she didn't have an answer for me. After a few minutes of that I had enough and left to do a different task away from her.

  


I really don't know if there's going to be any recovering from this as honestly I'm kinda shocked by the lack of respect and her choice to do that in front of me. I really enjoyed being friends with her prior to this and nothing similar ever happened, but I'm truly shocked and kind of disgusted by her actions.

  


I'm curious to hear if people think I'm overreacting, or I'm in the right. Thanks for hearing me out.

**Edit:** I appreciate all the responses, there have been some really worthwhile ones. I also see a lot of assumptions being made that aren't accurate as these things often go. Lastly I got a text from the girl saying she would better explain herself when she gets off work (about 2 hours from the time of this edit). I'll keep you guys updated.

**Edit 2:** I hadn't talked to her since the confrontation at work, and I left it at that to see if she would attempt to make amends over text as I really saw no reason trying to maintain a friendship if she didn't reach out. I'll copy paste the message I was sent by her:


Hey (my name), 
I just wanted to apologize again. You are right to feel the way you do. What we did was completely inappropriate and unfair. We thought it would be harmless fun but it definitely wasn't. I never meant to make you feel uncomfortable like that and put u in that position. I really value you as a friend and I would never do anything intentionally to jeopardize our friendship. I'm embarrassed and ashamed of our actions and I hope in your own time u can forgive me. U have my word nothing like that will EVER happen again. I'm so sorry again (my name)!
 
I responded by saying I appreciated her apology and it might be possible to get past this. But I told her I couldn't understand her motive in all of this, either way it seemed like a total lack of respect and consideration for me in the whole affair.

We'll see where this goes.

**Edit 3:** I just woke up. She's currently at work, and I never got a response to what I had sent her about my concerns. Tomorrow we are closing the golf course alone just the two of us, so I'm feeling like there will a resolution for the better or worst. Right now I'm not sure what that will be. I'll probably get a response later today, as it's really not like her to ignore one of my messages. Reading a lot of these comments, I'm realizing I didn't give enough context about our friendship. We became quite good friends after beggining to work together this summer, we both looked forward to shifts together as conversations flowed very easily and we could make each other laugh. We started hanging out quite often after work. Through our conversations, some very sexual things came up, but it was mostly either of us just recollecting experiences in the past. When I first met her I thought I met pursue her as we got along well, but I quickly found out she had a boyfriend and I left it at that. I never had any intentions of getting with the girl, or interfering with her relationship in any way, she seemed happy with her boyfriend and I respected that. I valued our friendship, and enjoyed working with her. If there were no motives behind this, then perhaps we can go back to being friends, as it really did make time pass when we were working together.",relationship_advice
I[19M] recently found out that my older sister[34F] is actually my biological mother.,"Throwaway account because I don't want this linked to my main account.

&#x200B;

My older sister(let's call her Rose) and I have a great relationship since I was a baby. we were raised with an amazing adoptive family and she has always taken care of me.

I grew up in a very warm and loving environment but from what i was told I was lucky.

I was told the story of how me and my sister had two drug addict parents who never took care of us. They never bothered feeding us and used to left us at a junky friends house for days to go out partying. When my mom was pregnant with me she smoked and got drunk(luckily i turned out pretty fine) pretty often and when I was born my sister was the only one who took care of me. When I was 2 months old they left us both in a mall and left. We got help from an old couple(who also turned into our adoptive family) and we contacted the police but my parents weren't at the house, which looked like a homeless cave. We never saw them again and after several months in foster care the couple that helped us(throughout the whole way btw) agreed to adopt us. Today I'm 19 and Rose is 34, I still live with my adoptive family and she lives about 20 minutes away so I come and visit her at least 3-4 times a week.

&#x200B;

So a couple of months ago my friend offered me to take a DNA test to find some information about my heritage, since my sister wouldn't speak of them much. After the results came in I found out some pretty interesting things(like being 50% Ashkenazi Jew) I found out later that I had an aunt\[33f\] in the system. I immediately reached out to her(Let's call her Jennet) and we agreed to meet in person. All that without telling Rose a thing.

When we met up I could see we have some similar characteristics like same hair color and same eyes. We tried to figure things out so I asked her if she has a brother or sister and she told me that when she was 13 her 14 year old sister got pregnant while being drunk with her junky boyfriend and a month after giving birth she ran away with the baby after some pretty intensive fights with their parents. They never found her and stopped looking after 1.5 years.

I connected the dots, asked to see a picture of her, so we went to her parents house. Mom wasn't home and father died 3 years ago. When I saw the picture, I knew. This was Rose, 100%.

Rose is my mom, we were never abandoned, we didn't have junky parents and she fabricated the entire thing to me and our adoptive family.

I immediately gave Jennet a hug and told her that it's too much for me right now and asked her to keep it a secret for now.

I went to my best friends house, told him everything and for a week now I'm sleeping over at his place. I told my parents and my sister im at his house because he bought a new game that we both wanted for long and avoided talking to Rose much.

I can't look her in the eyes right now, let alone tell her I know the truth.

What the hell am I supposed to do? How should I handle this? Should I tell her I know?

&#x200B;

EDIT: My best friend just took me out for a movie and a drink(im not that drunk right now though). I thank you all so much for your warm replies, made me look at the situation a bit clearer. I have decided to break it to Rose this week but I need some time to think about how to tell her I know.I don't know if I should try getting there slowly or just break the news to her somehow. I even considered bringing her sister with me but I genuinely think she will be pissed. I'll keep updating as soon as I'll decide how to tell her. Right now going to bed to sleep it over.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: After seeing some comments asking how the adoption process went, I decided I need to explain some things. First of all It's worth mentioning that the adoption process wasn't immediate and it took about a  year between the time that happy couple found us outside the mall and the time they adopted us. We were in foster care that time and Rose use to keep touch with them and they would come visit us once or twice a week(or so im told, i don't know what to believe now)/ eventually Rose broke down in tears for them and told them she hates foster care and that her little brother(me) would grow up here and she couldn't bare that thought. At that time they decided to try and adopt her and hired lawyers and stuff and after a few months it was legal and done. At least that what I was told. I don't think my adoptive parents knew but if they did then that story is probably a lie too.

"TIFU Update: I fucked up by not knowing the guy I like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass.""","Link to OG post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

Two months ago, I fucked up. I was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. I ended up realizing, not in a way that I wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab I work at. 

Basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and I were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when I said, ""I would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" He overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. I was so fucking mortified. 

I didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. That didn't happen. On my first day back, I was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""Oh fuck,"" I had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that I ought to apologize for my crass comment. But instead, I frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if I do that, he can't see me right? That didn't happen again. Instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""Hey [my name], how was your break?"" 

I looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. He told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. He didn't bring up what happened either thank god. Then he said something along the lines of, ""Is that all your having for lunch?"" and I was like, ""Uhm yeah, I was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

Then he said, ""Oh I was gonna go grab something to eat at [a sandwich place near us], do you wanna come with?"" 

I was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. I tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so I said sure and we went. 

Well. We ended up having a great lunch. Inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""So tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think I spent staring at you?"" I literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""It has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? That has to mean I like you."" (Btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

Even with my shock, I managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

Well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

We have not done the butt stuff. He told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. Looks like I will be retaining my butt virginity and I managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

TL;DR: Despite my fuck up, it all worked out. We're celebrating one month together tomorrow! Also, I'm a girl (got two comments asking if I was).

Edit: Yes, I accidentally wrote ""guess"" instead of ""guest."" My b, my b. ",tifu

AITA if I back out of being maid of honor at my best friends wedding next weekend? Best man is my ex fianc√© who cheated on me and I can't be around him let alone walk arm in arm with him.,"Jump into the worst week of my life. I was with my ex fianc√© for 6 years. Loved him with every fiber of my being, wedding planned for August. Refused a job offer so could move with him for his next Air Force assignment. Monday a call girl from a website called massage republic texts him in the middle of the night saying she's reaching out to old clients because she's back in the game (his phone was at my house while he was flying) I text back she must have wrong number. She says she doesn't. In a moment of brains I pretend to be him instead of the jealous girlfriend and call girl gives me all the details. I'm such a fool this had been happening under my nose for years. 

I confront him, he claims to be a sex addict and promises to change. I consider it for half a second and say no. Cue uncontrollable crying, self doubt, a battery of STD tests, awkward encounters with him, fight over the ring, his mom (who I loved) calling me non stop and begging me to reconsider and on and on. 

And on top of all this my best friend is marrying his best friend may 11th. Groom doesn't want to rock the boat at this late date and selecting a new best man. Bride says she has way too much in her plate and is begging me to just go through with it and she'll ""make it up to me."" 

I've never hated a human being as much as I hate him. I can't be in the same room with him let alone walk arm in arm with him. I understand the whole wedding doesn't need to fall apart because I'm upset. so I just want to not go and spend the day downing the left over percocets from my wisdom teeth operation, fucking as many tinder dudes who can stand to be around me after not showering and burning all his shit. 

Woukd I be the asshole if I back out of the wedding?

Edit: wow I checked out for a few hours to try and sleep and this exploded. I'm so sorry I haven't been reading I'll try and catch up

Edit 2: ok guys I don't know what the verdict is but whether or not you voted yta or NTA and said I should go anyways to support my friend (we were friends before we were born, our moms were college roommates) your argument were the most convincing. I'm going to suck it up, participate, have fun, make my lock screen image the text from ""Panama"" where she said ""remember, you liked tounging my asshole?"" so when I get sad I have an instant reminder of who he really is. And then when it's all over I'm going to scream myself hoarse and beat the ever living fuck out of my pillows. If I can update a week from now I will. I still have a lot of reading to do so thank you all for commenting.


Edit 3 (that wont be seen): guys I've had the worst week of my life and been crying almost non stop since 3AM last  Monday (or Tuesday, or whatever). I have to clear up people calling my best friend the asshole. That just isn't the case, at all. I love her as much as I love any person on the planet and she has my back. But this wedding is now a week away. It's not a simple thing of kicked me out or asking ex-fianc√© not to come. Everyone is furious with him but only she, me and he know the details of call girls. My ex's parents, grandparents and everyone else are going to be at the wedding. He's as close with the groom as I am with her. If they make big changes now then the day becomes about what HE did, not about the wedding. It's not my place to demand the groom change his best man... a week out no less...plus like I said he knows my ex cheated, he doesn't know my ex was sleeping with prostitutes. If I bring that up then this whole week becomes about THAT. My best friend and her groom being assholes isn't even an option on the table. They didn't do anything wrong and just reacting with the best information they have. My friend has offered me the chance to allow me and ex-fianc√© to walk in with other people or even separately, but I'm not going to do that. First of all because I think it will look weird. And secondly I foresee getting a sick since of satisfaction of touching him ONE LAST TIME--FOREVER and have him know that that spark he feels...could have been forever come August but he fucked it up.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by not hitting my girlfriend's ass,"Short and sweet one: Today, my girlfriend and I were presented the rare treat of an empty apartment, and thus decided to get nice and loud.  As she was riding me cowgirl, I decided to give her ass a nice hard slap; however, as we were being rougher than usual, she was bouncing up and down in a manner that made it hard to hit her bum.  Thus, on my attempt at spanking her, my hand instead collided against my left testicle.  Instantly, a pain shot through the core of my very being, causing me to cry out in pain.  My girlfriend, being the epitome of love and sympathy that she is, immediately collapsed on the bed cackling like a mad witch while I cradled my bruised babymakers.

TIFU by ordering underwear off of Amazon.,"

Not a fuck up that just happened, but one that I just realized happened. 

This Christmas season, and like the last few, I did almost at all of my shopping via Amazon. For friends and family that live far away I had their gifts shipped right to their house.

After spending more that I should this holiday season I haven't felt the need to buy anything until last week. I remembered I had a $50 Amazon gift card, and decided to get myself more boxer briefs and black long sleeve undershirts. I ended up with around $70 (Puma performance boxer briefs are super comfy) in my cart. A few quick clicks and one confirmation email let me know my order went through. 

Like I said that was last week. But as of today the package still hadn't gotten here. So I checked my order and it says that it arrived. I was pissed. I had issues with delivery in the past. But I live in a small apartment building and I didn't think anyone would take my boxes. 

And then I noticed the address it shipped to. Apparently Amazon auto filled in the last address I used:

 my Reddit Secret Santa. 

So one of you guys out there got a random shipment of underwear. If you could return them  PM me. I'd appreciate it. Otherwise enjoy some comfy boxer briefs.

AITA for telling my disabled son and his partner I disapprove of their relationship?,"I'm fully prepared to be called an asshole.

My son is 23 and has cerebral palsy that is quite severe. It only affects him physically. He is very smart. I have recently setup his financials where he gets his disability sent to  him directly and got him his own place. 

His caregiver visits him daily at his new place. I did this because I wanted my son to be independent. 

He did very well for a few months but recently he has gotten into a relationship with a 58 year old man that I simply do not approve of.

It's not that I'm homophobic. But it's the fact that this man older then me has now moved in with my son. They've only known each other for three months.

And what's worse is that my son isn't gay. I had a heartfelt conversation where my son broke down and admitted he isn't gay but is scared of dying alone.

I have been heartbroken ever since and tried to setup some counseling sessions only to find out that his partner is double booking activities on those days and forcing my son to choose.

I'm not sure what this older man's deal is. He is contributing around 25% of the rent and seems to work.

Last Sunday I had them over for lunch and I couldn't control myself. I called him a predator and I thought he was disgusting. He then proceeded to take it on himself to physically push my son out the house without even asking.

My son called me after and said that what I did was wrong and I don't understand his predicament.

Every instinct in me is telling me that man is bad news. 

I'm contemplating reporting him to the authorities. But that might be going too far and my son will likely resent me.

Was I really the asshole for calling out that creep like that? 

All I want is for my son to be happy. And right now, I really don't think this situation with a man he isn't attracted to is making him happy. But he is 23 and I may have overstepped.",AmItheAsshole
Being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but I don't have a rally cry of support behind me,"My ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. I have none of that. Its not that my friends don't think I'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. What about single dads?  We do the same shit. I work and take care of my kids the same way but I don't get celebrated like I'm doing something amazing. I just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

Edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. I hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because I sounded like I wanted a cookie for being a dad. It may have sounded like I wanted credit for some shit I'm supposed to do. 

That's not the case. I've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and I'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then I play with my kid so I'm not just there on my phone. Its not the same for us. We don't have the same resources. Although some of you have suggested some that I hadn't heard of. 

Anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and I think that may be how it came across. Thanks for all your support and for making me feel like I'm doing good as a parent. 


Edit 2 - Well this blew up. I'd like to say that I really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. Thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. To those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why I put this in unpopular opinions. Not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

As has been repeatedly pointed out, I know I'm not a full time single parent. I'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. Sometimes its hard. Just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. I can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

LPT: When reading a company's Glassdoor pay attention to the date of the review. If you notice a lot of good reviews in a short time frame then that means that HR sent out a bulletin for employees to write reviews for the company.,"My company's HR recently sent out a memo to all employees and left up many flyers to tell us to review our company on Glassdoor. This is allowed by Glassdoor and a tactic they advocate for companies wishing to combat their negative reviews or low rating. Though the memo/flyer say to leave ""honest"" reviews theres an implication that they want us to leave good/positive reviews.

When I had initially started working for my company the rating was in the low 3's and the reviews were pretty sporadic in terms of the date. After the memo I saw a huge amount of positive reviews in a short time frame and their rating went up to 4.6. This overshadowed the negative reviews which I found to be accurate.

edit: Some have asked what does it mean if there are a lot of bad reviews in a short time frame. That usually means that theres been a layoff or a [negative] restructure in management.",LifeProTips
A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,"So, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  He glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.

My [22f] boyfriend's [24m] new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile,"Hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

I don't really know how to begin so I'm just gonna dive right in. We've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and I have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

Last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. This took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. His parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. To the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

The problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. He has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. He talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. Cool, I thought. That all sounds beautiful. 

We didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. It was on a day I was working so I couldn't go with him and when I asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. I was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

I did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

It was definitely a shock but I reacted positively and told him it looked really good. It was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

It's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. Colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. I can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. Bf is super proud of it and I honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

My only issue with it is during sex. 

It takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. It doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo REALLY stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

Not to mention this thing is like the Mona fu*cken Lisa. 

Any position that we're facing each other in, I always end up making eye contact with it. And every time I do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. Every time. Ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, I doubt I would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of ANY six year old. 

It's honestly ruining our sex life. 

I haven't told my bf any of this because I feel like I can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (I know lasers exist but I doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

Lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where I'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried I'm not attracted to him anymore.

I am attracted to him. I'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

What can I do in this situation? The thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. But looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

Should I talk to him? Am I overreacting? Is our sex life officially dead? 

Thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- My boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and I can't stop making eye contact with it during sex.

I'll make a new post to update how things go once I've talked to my bf about all this. If he doesn't see this post first I think I'll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

Cop thought my real ID was fake.,"I went to a festival that was 18+ and I'm 24 years old.  When I got carded at the door, three different people checked my ID and then a cop came over and checked my ID and pulled me to the side and told me to fess up or I would go to jail.  I held my ground, knowing my ID was real, and said that he can do whatever he wants to verify my ID/age.  He called some number on his phone and verified my ID was in fact accurate and apologized for the confusion.  I asked what was wrong with the ID and all he really said was that, ""the lettering was off"".

My question is, how did my ID become fake all of a sudden?  I've used the same ID to get into bars and previous 18+ events and never had a problem.  I've even been pulled over twice before where police never questioned my ID.  Do IDs wear out over time?  I'm going to get a new ID here so I guess it doesn't matter but, I'm just curious as to what happened.

"AITA for flipping at my husband for spending thousands of dollars on a football game with his buddies, without telling me about it?","For starters, I'm a 26 year old woman, my husband is 25. We also have a 2 year old son. We both work full time and make good money, he brings in more than I do, but I think that's besides the point. We also have a joint account. So fast forward to the game, apparently he decided to take it upon himself to take him and 3 buddies to a game with a party bus, great seats, etc and all the other shenanigans with a sports event. He makes a lot more than his buddies and he wanted to ""have a good time with them"". When I checked the account, he spent over 4 thousand dollars! My jaw dropped when I saw it. I confronted him about it the day after and he told me that ""he's able to because he makes good money and it's not gonna break our bank"", he then went on to say to me that I don't get to choose what he spends his money on. I was super pissed and was like ""it's OUR money"" and we've got bills and a child to care for and support. He continued to tell me that I was the one in the wrong and that he's a responsible adult who doesn't need to have his purchases ""monitored by his wife"". So my question is AITA?

Edit: I appreciate the support, this really has hit me pretty hard, I feel like I've been betrayed. I'm new to Reddit btw. It's making me feel like I'm not of equal importance in this family. I've been with my husband for 6 years and I've never felt this way before.

AITA for not letting my boyfriend's best friends use my airline discount after saying they could?,"Throwaway because all parties know my account name.

Backstory: My boyfriend (Alex\*) and I have been together for 4 years, I've become friends with his two best friends (James\* and Noah\*) but we're not particularly close nor do we ever hang out without him. I work for an airline and one of the major perks is that I get discounts on flights that I can also use for family and friends. As I am in my first year with the company I only get a certain number of discount seats and I had 3 left for the year.

Situation: Alex asked me if I could use my discount to buy tickets for him and his two best friends. I happily agreed since he deserved a nice holiday. He booked his time off work and they made their plans. They were to send me the money and then I would put it all on my card just for simplicity.

Three nights ago Alex came home really upset. He told me his friends had decided to change the holiday dates, bringing them forward a week, because it clashed with a concert they wanted to go to. He was upset because he couldn't move his holiday dates with work and when he told his friends they had decided to go without him because they had been looking forward to the gig for ages. I was pretty angry on his behalf especially since he had done most of the planning, including finding the hotel. To make up for I started planning a trip for me and him on his holiday dates.

James messaged me last night and said he would put the money in my account this morning. No ask if he could still use my discount, no explanation for what they had done, nothing. I was outraged that he would even suggest using my discount after fucking over my boyfriend. I sent him a polite but blunt message explaining that he and Noah were no longer able to use my discount on this holiday as I would be using the seats for me and Alex and that they were still welcome to use them on a holiday that involved my boyfriend in the future. He replied with a barrage of texts saying that I was being selfish and unfair as I had ""promised"" two seats to him and Noah and that they were using the money they were saving to go to the concert. He even phoned Alex to complain. Alex is torn. He thinks it's a little unfair to let his friends down and doesn't want this affecting the relationship between me and his friends so I should just give them the seats to keep the peace. I refused and was hurt that he was still taking sticking up for them.

Am I the asshole for going back on my word and choosing to use the seats for myself?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your support. I must admit I know this seems a bit like a validation post with all the NTA votes but I hate going back on my word and I guess I did feel a bit like an asshole just because I've known these guys 4 years and didn't want to make life hard for my boyfriend so I needed some honest opinions. This sub has shown me the light and I will be showing Alex this when I get home. He is a massive people pleaser and hates letting people down so that explains it but he's going to get a spine even if I have to grow it in a lab. I'm standing my ground and taking the trip myself. Any holiday suggestions?

2ND UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your votes and insights. It made me realise that even though most of you have voted me NTA, there are some things I hadn't considered. I have spoken to Alex and shown him this thread (guess I don't know why I used a throwaway) and he actually feels a lot better about speaking to them about it now. He apologised for making me feel bad for standing up for him when he didn't stand up for himself and I apologised for not discussing my choice with him before I told his friends they can't use my discount in the way that I did. He said he's just going to let it play out but he'll be willing to forgive them eventually. So for those wanting a final dramatic update, I don't think we'll be getting one.

Update: My ex husband and his new wife made my daughter a back brace out of wood and steel and forced her to wear it (Florida),"**EDIT:** Forgot to add this...My first post was here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4a97dq/my_ex_husband_and_his_new_wife_made_my_daughter_a/

Firstly I would like to thank everyone for all the support in my first post and all the supportive PM's I received. It was really overwhelming (in a good way). A few people asked for an update so here it is.

So a lot has happened since I first posted. I called in to work while I was trying to get all this sorted. One of my co-workers has a cousin who is a lawyer and she knew someone who was able to help me and file the paperwork. My husband played dumb in court but his visits got reduced to supervised and he was ordered to take a parenting class. My daughter went to physiotherapy. Eventually the court reinstated his visitation when he swore he had learned his lesson and was sorry and with his otherwise clean record the court agreed. I was against it but the court ruled against me.

I gave my daughter her own cell phone so she could call me whenever she needed to. On her second visit it happened again. This time the brace had steel and fabric instead of wood and they took her phone too. The next night she left when they weren't looking and went up the street to a neighbor who is a police officer. The neighbor called paramedics and her co-workers. They had to cut the brace off my daughter. My husband and his wife were arrested. They got out quickly but they have been charged and their infant is with CPS. My ex lost visitation and custody and I'm working on making it permanent. Unfortunately my daughter's shoulder was dislocated from the brace. It set back her rehab and part of her arm is still numb and tingling. She needed surgery and is still recovering. She always played sports (especially at school) and did dance but the doctor thinks she won't ever be able to lift her arm all the way up again. I hate my ex and he'll see her again over my fucking dead body. Right now I'm focusing on my daughter while my lawyer takes care of things. That's my update.",legaladvice

TIFU by not telling my wife our son was coming home,"This happened Sunday night.



My oldest son is in the Marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  He took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  At first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. When it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  I tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



I get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  He gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his Dress blues.  Now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



We discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  We go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  We settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... Free internet points and all that......



I walk in and the house is quiet.  No one in the living room.  A little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  Alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



What i did not know was the entire time i was gone, My wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  She got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  Took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



So no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to Surprise her.  A handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  Pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  The text told my son to stay outside.  I had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



So my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  I told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  The look of confusion on her face was priceless.  It took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  Finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, There was our son in his dress uniform and She was estatic.  The noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  Except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  It goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  Also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess TIFU will have to suffice instead.




TL;DR  Didn't tell Wife that Marine son was coming home, Missed out on Sexy times and the second half of the Packers/Falcons game



edit 1: Goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.

Update: Wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  Have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  She is worried that this story will end up in one of her Marine Moms FB groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.

(update) My autistic brother was banned from the local hobby shop.,"[So i came here yesterday to ask for some advice on my situation and I thought I might as well leave a update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9l2z39/co_my_autistic_brother_was_banned_from_the_local/)

&#x200B;

So I want to start out by saying that I was wrong and I want to apologize to anyone I may have hurt with my last question. It was wrong of me to defend my brothers actions and I wish I could have seen that at the time but thats the past.

I went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too. Me and my dad went last night and apologized to the shop owner for our actions and how we treated him and the victim of my brother and that we agree with his ban. The owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. The girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said I felt that I needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. My parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs. 

&#x200B;

I really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn I was wrong. Like I said I'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, I didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too. This has been a learning experience for me and I hope that I can become a better person because of it.",legaladvice

AITA for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?,"**EDIT: THE BOYFRIEND DOESNT LIVE WITH US AND DOESNT PAY RENT OR BILLS. HIM AND HIS DAUGHTES SPEND TIME HERE AND PAY ONLY FOR THEIR FOOD: SOMETHING I DO AS WELL*** 

My dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she's started seeing. I'm 23M and going into my final year of college. My moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. My mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone's favourite uncle. And while i'm glad everyone else is comfortable, i'm not. 

He isn't a bad guy, I'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. He tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. Boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. I think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

He's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. They aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~. 

I live in the basement of my moms house. I have since i was 15. When you come in the front door there's a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. So it's pretty separate. 

So last night i was DDing for some friends and got home at 2 am. I had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren't until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. So this has never been a big deal with my parents. I shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

Tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. I got a lecture and sent to my room and ""possible loss of car privileges.""

I snapped and laid it out for him. I told him i'm leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i'm glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. I told him our relationship won't be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won't want to have a relationship with him.

"Just became homeless and have $130 and a bike, what do i do?","So a few hours ago i was kicked out of my parents house. I've been ""disowned"" or something. They made it really clear they wont be taking me back. Im 20, no job, no real friends and no family at all.

I was able to get my bike from my parents' since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. Maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. I was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. Im guessing I'll have to buy something every few hours so I won't get kicked out. 

So basically what the fuck do i do next? Im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. So if there's an app or a website for that I'll take recommendations.




Edit: im saved!! Well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. He works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won't be until 5 or 6 am. Right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. Im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. This post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

Edit2: wow this blew up fast. I see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. I never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. I wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. Im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. I'm extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. As long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

A lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. I worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

A lot of people were recommending joining the military. I've considered the Navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)


((Edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo.

After talking some more with my fianc√©, we actually decided to postpone our wedding. 
We talked a lot about boundaries and I told him that some things are not ok. He has been single and free his whole life until we met and I imagine it's hard for him to readjust his thoughts about some things. 
We also agreed that we both had issues we should work on before getting married. My issues mainly being my insecurities. 

At first I was really sad, but I actually think this is a very good thing. I had so many negative feelings about the wedding, and now we have the opportunity to fix whats wrong. Maby the next time we try will feel so much more right, and we'll have mostly happy feelings. :) 

Thank you to everyone who commented on the last post! You made me actually take the difficult step to talk about boundaries!

TIFU by walking into my son's bedroom without knocking while he was with his girlfriend,"My son is 18 and we generally get along pretty well, though he's going through his own life and I'm trying to respect that.

So I came home after work, him after school, I decided to visit his room to ask him what he wanted for dinner and to maybe play some Mario Kart.

I'm still mortified at what I found...

I walk in, fully clothed my son's girlfriend is on all fours on the bed, my son's face is buried into her butt... She stares at me with the widest eyes I've ever seen and within milliseconds releases what can only be described as the ""Horns of the apocalypse"" and farts directly into my son's face. 

He falls backward off the bed, brings down an entire table on top of him, she falls off the front of the bed flipped completely upside down, vertically. He yells ""dad!!"" when suddenly the contents of his entertainment center come crashing down on him.

I rush to his aid, the room smells of some kind of mix of tunafish and hard boiled eggs. My son's pants are down, he's crying and I'm panicking trying to unbury him below the rubble. 

His girlfriend then runs out of the room and heads for the bathroom, all I can hear are explosive noises that could break glass with soundwaves.

My son is bleeding, I haven't said one word at this point. I muster the strength I have to get him to the car for an ER visit. I try to get his girlfriend but all I hear from the bathroom is a mix of crying and fart trumpets exploding.

In a moment of weakness I back up and just leave my house locking the door.

My son's alright now, physically anyway. I'll update if he gets pink eye. His girlfriend hasn't contacted us so I can assume she's still going to town. I'm no longer hungry so dinner's out.

tl;Dr walked in on my son burying his face into his girlfriend's anus, she farts, he falls off bed and takes down a table and his entertainment center.

**UPDATE**

Thanks so much for the gold! I originally just wanted to type this out as a literal ""TIFU"", as in I felt like I had really screwed up and wanted some support. I misunderstood the humor this subreddit is usually used for; I should have been more discreet with details to say the least. I never anticipated for a second this would grow to this level.

My son is fine, he just ended up with a few scrapes and bruises. I was mainly concerned at the site of blood added by the fact that all the objects falling down on him were pretty heavy game systems, figurine statues and the like.

We haven't spoken much about the incident, but I did pry a few details out, in the least judgmental, kind way I could think to. 

They had the house to themselves, it started with cuddling as she didn't feel very well (obviously) and he admitted he just wanted to ""sniff"" her butt. She was probably reluctant to reveal HOW she didn't feel very well. We *are* talking, but not much. He's let out a few chuckles and smiles with red face. I realize walking in was a huge violation of privacy, but I am trying my very best to band-aid this. He is aware of the Reddit post but doesn't mind.

When we got home the bottom lock on the door was locked and she was nowhere in sight. She hasn't contacted him at all since it happened, but in a few days or whenever she gets back to him I plan on driving him over to see her, and giving her the kindest smile and wave I can muster, all jokes suppressed. 

If any of his gaming stuff is damaged I plan on fully replacing them, and getting him new stuff as an apology.

A few answered questions:

* I did not enter the room with my pants off. I was fully clothed, she was fully clothed, his pants were merely down. I originally typed out the TIFU in a hurry while we sat down.

* I'm unsure what caused the massive explosion and upset stomach, but I suspect it was already brewing before I walked in, and she was trying to suppress it when she became a deer in headlights when I walked in.

* I will knock before entering or maybe even call him the next time I get home! I realize now I invaded his privacy pretty heavily.

* The room does still faintly smell, and Febreze just lingers in the air with the smell. I suspect she did more than fart on his face...

* No pink eye luckily, either of us, yet

My (20F) boyfriend (21M) wouldn't pay for my meal when I forgot my wallet,"Basically the title. 

Usually on dates, we split the bill. I don't really care like in the past, I've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. Like we'd go back and forth. 

My current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. From the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. I was fine with it, I didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. Paying on a date is sweet to me and I like it but I have my own job so it's whatever. I figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

Anyway I didn't really have any problem with it. But we went out to some random spot. Like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. So he went down the line and he got his own meal. I ordered mine and then when I went into my bag, I realized I forgot my wallet at my house. I told him that I forgot it by accident and I thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

I was just like what the fuck..? This guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and I paid him back through cashapp. After we ate, I lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city.

AITA for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?,"My younger sister and I were very close when young but no so much now. I was born in fairly well to do Hindu family. I fell in love and married a Muslim man and had to convert to his religion. My family was pretty pissed off that I converted but we've kept in touch.

Recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. My mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

My sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. I was happy for her.

It all began when I asked what religion he was. Imagine my surprise when she said that he was Hindu AND THE SAME COMMUNITY AS OUR PARENTS. This would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

I asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. She got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
I suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

I explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. It was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

She told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and I was being rude. I told her that I wasn't, I was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  I then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
At this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. At this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


Later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. She called me 'toxic'.

Idiot me then tries to sell the story and continue on about how lonely I've been recently. He tells me he's off in a few minutes and insists on watching the movie with me. I try to fight it but I could only argue so much without giving away the truth. Bartender is insistent. I text my date what's happening. Go back to theater with my new date. Sit a few rows in front of my first date. She has the stupidest grin on her face as me and the bartender (Jared) sit a couple rows in front of her. He ends up being super cool and bought me and him another bottle during the movie. Movie ends. I thank him for his gesture. He didn't even ask for my number or anything.

"AITA for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 Ford Bronco I owned as a teenager?","So how to begin with this...I realize that on paper I am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations I'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even I did the right thing. 

When I was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 Ford Bronco. It was my true passion and I don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. Plus my dad and I would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when I was teenager it was always that Bronco that brought us back together. I made a huge mistake and sold the truck when I turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, I've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

We had a baby in early February. she is our first and the light of my life. My wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. I guess I need to say this. 

Two weeks ago I was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a Bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. I stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. My dad and I had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so I just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't MY BRONCO! 

I asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on I-25 as we spoke from Colorado to buy it for $21000. I freaked out and asked him if I could buy it right then and there for $23000. He said if I could come up with the cash, yes. I had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so I had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, I maxed out my credit card to Venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and I fucking drove away in my old car. It was like a dream come true. Like a literal dream come true. It needs a lot of work I can't afford right now but it's mine. Like in my driveway mine. Again. I can't even describe what a joy this is. 

My wife and her parents are furious with me. They feel I was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. My point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. But this Bronco means everything to me and if I wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. Now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. To me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

Like I said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. How do you guys see it?

Edit: had no idea this would go so one way. I guess I messed up. I talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. The $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever I need to restore it. She's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. Sorry to get everyone so mad at me, I was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the ""mommy bailed you out"" comments really necessary ? I found a solution and it's coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it's not like I'm not paying for it on my own eventually.

Edit 3: my inbox is so buried I have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. Does anyone know what those are ?

Edit4: I'm getting a 403 error whenever I try to respond, not sure what that means but I'm still reading because honestly I'm afraid to go home even with the great news I know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

Edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? I messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/SnausageFest since you're a mod, do you know? I can't respond to any posts and get the ""status 403"" whenever I try. Thanks!

Edit in the morning: I couldn't figure out why I was getting so many private's  but I guess this must be locked now. I didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and Said I found a buyer for the bronco. I'll figure out how to cross that bridge when I get there but my wife was so relieved that I ""had come to your senses"" I don't want to disappoint her.

Update 2: Just did one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. Today after breakfast I told her we should ""sit down and talk."" She was hesitant, but I said it was important. We went to the living room and she said to me ""I already know what this is about."" My post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" Of course the water works started happening right away. I told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. Through her tears, she said ""I was just joking, I wasn't serious."" She then went on saying stuff like ""I love you, I love you."" I told her I can't be in a marriage where my S/O doesn't love me the same way I love them. She tried to tell me that she loved me and that I meant something to her. But it was all bullshit. She said she ""didn't want to lose me."" I told her I don't think this marriage was the right decision. And from there I basically told her it was over. I told her I knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. For all those wondering, we have no kids, and I pay fully for the apartment we live in, and I own almost everything we have other then her clothes. I even pay for her car. So after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. Before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, I've never been so happy with a decision I've made in my life. After that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""Fuck you."" She started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" I told her I could do whatever I wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. She screamed at me saying, ""You're the fucking worst relationship I've ever been in. You think I can't find someone again?"" ""Do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? You're a fucking idiot [my name]."" She grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""I'm leaving!"" Before slamming the door behind her. At that moment I felt like I was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of TV. I sat down on the couch and cried, and I'm still crying as I type this up. It's both happy and sad tears, and I knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. She never loved me, it was obvious. Our relationship only went one way, and I feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier I live in California, and I'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. Tomorrow, I'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (I'm not throwing out her stuff. Just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. All of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and I know my life will certainly improve as a result.

Edit/Update: Thanks everyone for the kind words! Really has made me feel a lot better! Going to be talking to her soon. Also, I noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, I understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. I've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. Not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. Also I used an old alt since she uses Reddit. Anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the Internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. I'm going to talk to her today. I will be updating you all soon after.

Edit: Meant to put wife in the title but now I can't change it.

Basically the title. I overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while I was passing the bedroom. This friend is in a serious relationship. My wife then said to her, ""Sweetie, remember it's your choice. Don't settle for just anyone. That's the mistake I made. Who knows who else I could of had. [My name] was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" Hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. Does she even love me? Why am I being treated as a second base? 

Am I being dramatic and overreacting? I haven't said anything about it since. I honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",relationship_advice
"AITA for telling my sister a ""wedding tattoo"" is a curse (even though I have one), and now the curse is coming true?","My partner and I are in our 30s and we live in a country where gay marriage is illegal. We got engaged years ago knowing we wouldn't be able to marry, but we set a ""wedding"" date and had a party for friends and family. Instead of an actual ceremony, we got matching tattoos. We had been together 7 years when that happened, and it's been another 6 years since then.

Anyway, my sister has been with her husband for just under 2 years. They got engaged almost as soon as they started dating, and they married 3 months ago. However, they're both not into wearing rings, so my sister suggested to her husband to get tattoos instead.

I jokingly told her that it's a curse (that getting a tattoo of a boyfriend/husband/partner's name will result in a break-up) and she said that my relationship is still going strong despite the curse. I said yeah, but we were together for 7 years when we got the tattoos, and btw we didn't tattoo each other's names but something else (a picture of a memory we have together), whereas she was going for straight-up ""Samuel <3 21.6.19"" in huge thick letters across her wrist. I told her not to do it, and to just wear her wedding band on a necklace or something, but she told me to piss off, and did it anyway.

Fast forward, her marriage is falling apart. Nothing happened, they just seem to be realizing they're not a good fit, and it's only a question of time when they'll divorce. They don't even live together anymore, he moved out 3 weeks into their marriage.

Now, my sister is blaming me for subconsciously influencing her and making her marriage fail. She thinks that me saying it was a curse subconsciously made her act towards her husband in a certain way that resulted in him being pushed away and not loving her anymore. I've never heard of something like this before. I very much doubt I have this superpower of destroying relationships. But my sister is currently going around telling our relatives I'm the asshole that ruined her marriage.

AITA for not letting a friend use my umbrella in a Japanese downpour?,"My friends and I went sightseeing, aware that the weather forecast was warning of heavy rain.

We're from England, where the correct response to rain is to not acknowledge it, but things are a little different in Japan. It is impossible to walk outside without getting fully soaked. I warned my friends of this and stopped at a shop to buy an umbrella. They were reluctant to get one; either underestimating the rain or thinking they could get one later, if it actually rained.

I warned them multiple times that if it rains, I would not let them borrow my umbrella.

One friend had a raincoat so was mostly fine but the other did not. I reminded them that I would not share a few more times while we were walking. 

Roughly an hour later, it started raining. Hard. It was unlikely to stop raining any time soon and we had a train to catch so we walked in the rain for half an hour to the train station. I stood by my word and refused to let them use my umbrella (which could easily fit 2 people under it). When we arrived, the friend without the raincoat was completely soaked, and the other was far from dry. Neither were particularly happy.

TIFU by holding my breath and passing out during a lecture.,"This happened earlier today. So I was in class listening to a lecture and it dawned on me that I couldn't care less about what my professor was talking about. So I decided to start holding my breath. Now, this is something I normally do if I get really bored. I'll hold my breath for as long as I can and then I'll rest for 3 minutes. I'll do 5 sets of that. I also make sure to pinch my nose as to avoid cheating. I've actually gotten pretty good at it and can hold my breath for 2 minutes and 15 seconds now. Anyways, I start holding my breath and I'm feeling particularly good and I start thinking I can break my record today. I got to about 2 minutes and 20 seconds on my first attempt and then I decide to drop out. ""I can do better, let's go for 2 minutes and 50 seconds"". So I go and I'm feeling super confident about it. I get to 2 minutes 20 sec and I'm feeling a little light headed. Get to 2 min and 30 seconds and I'm struggling. Like I'm thrashing around silently in my chair, but I'm going for gold. Get to 2 minutes 40 and I'm seriously hurting. Things are getting bad. I close my eyes to avoid looking at my watch (It also made the seconds go faster) All of a sudden I open my eyes and I'm looking up at the ceiling and everyone is flipping out. As I learned from the girl sitting next to me, it turns out my maximum effort resulted into me passing out, smashing my head on my desk, and falling out of my chair. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to explain to everyone that I was fine. Lecture finally resumed and I just sat there feeling like a dumbass with a gnarly headache.

AITA for getting a family thrown out of a restaurant for underage drinking?,"Throwaway account.  We were at a local restaurant last Saturday evening. This is a locally owned establishment, not a chain. There was a 30-45 minute wait for tables.  There was another family waiting in the wait area, and the ""mom"" went to the bar and came back with three drinks. A beer for ""dad"" and a margarita for her and one of the young women. There was another young woman there who looked of college age, and had on a college sorority t-shirt, but no drink was brought for her.

But as I watched I noticed that the mom was sharing her margarita with the 4th girl, who I assumed was under 21 as she had no drink of her own. In fact, I'd guess the 4th girl consumed MOST of the mom's margarita. I mentioned this to my husband and he said so what, forget it. Full disclosure that I'm a non drinker myself and certainly don't approve of underage drinking, not to mention that this behavior might put the restaurant at risk. So I mentioned it to the hostess. A short time later a manager (I assume) came and asked to see the girls' ID's. The girl with her own drink produced one. The second girl who had been drinking from Mom's drink did not.  I did not hear the exchange, but the family left thereafter. I assume they were asked to do so.

WIBTA for forbidding my Father in law from seeing my kids until he stops his behavior,"My father in law is the king of passive aggressive comments and passing judgement on other people's lives.

If my father in law had it his way, I would be waiting on my husband and kids hand and foot at all times. 

His recent tactic of snarky comments has been to say that everything we own or pay for is done with my husband's money.

It's annoying and frustrating. I tried being snarky back, didn't work. I tried talking to him about it and he just pretended he didn't know what I was talking about.

The final straw was that my kids have started saying it. I mentioned to my husband that I was going to get my hair cut and my son pipes up with, ""so you're going to go waste dad's money on yourself?"" and both kids start laughing.

A Marine returns from duty in Iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in Afghanistan.,"That evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.

As he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.

The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.

As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.

Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...

""These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan."" He says, ""Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home.""

The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.

After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.

""Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here?"" Asks the replacement. ""And what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?""

""Well, I'll be honest with you"", replies the marine, ""this a shit post, and what you're looking at here is a criminal punch line.""",Jokes

[UPDATE] I (28M) think my girlfriend (26F) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.,"Link to previous post [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=JQRWKQ4D&sh=e1753ed8)

I finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. A lot of things that I never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

As soon as she opened the door to our apartment, I could tell that she was already starting to cry. Seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because I didn't want to put her in that position. 

I had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

We sat down, there were lots of tears. I thought I would be bitter, angry and that I would be screaming at her the whole time but I felt disappointed instead. 

I told her that I saw the messages and explained how I ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

She kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

Then I told her that WE go more way back than they ever did. I was there through her lowest point, I helped her get up.

She admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

I saw it coming, I had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. At that point, I was full on crying. I can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. It still is now. 

I remember telling her that I was done, that whatever we had was over. She kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, I don't think I ever will. I can't tolerate people who cheat.

By that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

Obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

When I posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. His place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. He'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that I can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

We both agreed that I don't mention him in this post. I'm glad that I really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. Thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

It's almost 3am, I'm heartbroken as ever but I'm trying my best. I'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. Every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. I'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

To all my Aussie mates,  if you live near/around Chapel Hill, let me know! 

America, you were great but now it's time to come home. Thanks for the help everyone.

EDIT: I'm crying again, not because I got cheated on but because I realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. I almost can't believe I looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. I am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

Anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

I may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but I gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

Other than that, I am feeling better. It still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? She made her choice so I made mine. 

I woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that I shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

It sucks that I may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. I thanked them and said that although I believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

Ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so I junked it straight away. 

I miss her like crazy. I know it will take a lot of time to heal me but I guess I can wait. 

ps. I'll message my newfound Aussie friends when I go through all the comments. Exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but I'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

So we decided to fuck with the sub.,"# Major Update: 60 Minute Contest Mode & Extension of Beta Testing to August 14. 

**We have now updated the contest mode to 60 minutes after significant feedback requesting it. The Beta Test will be extended to August 14.** It has now been approximately 6 days since our test began. We ran into **overwhelmingly** positive feedback, and we thank you all for participating in our beta test so far. Please see below for some comparative information!

**We noticed MASSIVE increases in time until top comment**

> Before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> With the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (Around 30-40% increase)

> With the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). This is an INCREDIBLE increase and very rare for Reddit as a whole. We're taking this as a win. (Around 120-150% increase)

> Unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. However, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**Currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to Google).**

> We don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. However, we know it was much shorter. I think it was somewhere around half?

> This shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. Longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback). 


**More information to be seen! We will be releasing a poll shortly, along with a new thread.**

# Original Thread Info

Hey all you assholes and judges. We recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. A huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. [Take a look here](https://m.imgur.com/a/vZVv1ag). 

We think that's a problem. A comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. We want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. So, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# Introducing ~~30-Minute~~ 60-Minute Contest Mode

For the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **Contest Mode.** The comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. You will not be able to see the karma score of comments. After 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. The comment order will be ""Best"" instead. 

**Why did we do this?** The first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. By opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. No one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. We tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). It didn't work out well. A 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",AmItheAsshole
John Lennon was a piece of crap person and a piece of crap singer who doesn't deserve the hype around his life.,"He was a known wife beater who often flew into uncontrollable fits of rage that he directed to the various women in his life.  Lennon resented his son Julian, and narcissisticly blamed the boy for a marriage he did not want to be in. After Lennon divorced his wife, he took off with Yoko Ono and dropped out of his son's life for years. Julian has stated that Paul McCartney was far more of a father to him than John ever was. 

John was a pathological liar who claimed he had been raised in a working class family in Liverpool when he was actually raised in a comfortable upper middle class home. He often claimed to be single during his early years of stardom, despite being married. He claimed to have met Yoko Ono at an art show; falling in love at first sight, when in fact, Ono had stalked him for months before he gave in to her.

John claimed to have lost interest in the Beatles due to Paul McCartney's tendencies toward pop music when in fact, he had spent two years in a daze as a result of a serious addiction to heroin. Together, he and Yoko  destroyed the Beatles, then he blamed the breakup on Paul McCartney. 

He was politically clueless and gave money to publicity violent and radical groups such as the Black Panthers.

He was no better than an average guitar player who mostly confined his playing to the basic rhythm parts and his piano playing was amateurish. 
His song writing was no better;  The lyrics to Strawberry Fields Forever and Come Together are pure drug induced hippie psychedelic babble.

Lennon was a raging hypocrite who lived the do as I say, not as I do life perhaps more flamboyantly than anyone. All you have to do is look at his songs. Lennon, who sang Imagine no Possessions lived a millionaire's life in a posh New York hotel.  Lennon sang Imagine no Religion, while he was was obsessed with every spiritual and New Age fad that came along, including Hindu meditation, the I-Ching, and astrology of all kinds.  And it was Lennon who sang All you need is Love, yet lived a violent, and angry life while abusing his family and friends. And it was Lennon who sang about having nothing to kill or die for helped finance radical and violent political groups.

Lennon was a piece of shit and the world should know this about him.

"AITA for ""tattling"" on my boyfriend to his mother","My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years, and things were great until our daughter was born 6 months ago.

Since then, our relationship has gone down the tubes because he refuses to care for her. He'll sit on the couch and play video games and he'll only tend to her while she's screaming if I tell him to. Even then, unless I'm in the middle of doing something right then, he'll ask me why I can't just do it instead. On top of that, he only holds her if I hand her to him while he's watching tv and she's calm. He stays up late playing video games but still won't get her when she cries, so I have to get up with her. We've talked about it multiple times, to the extent that I've told him I can't handle it anymore, and he improves for a week and then goes back to his old ways.

I'm honestly considering filing for custody but tried one last ditch effort. I put the baby in his gaming room and told him I was going out. In reality, I just went to the gas station because I felt like I couldn't trust him, and sure enough when I got back the baby was screaming and he was ignoring her. I took a ~10 second video of this and after I comforted the baby, I sent it to his mother with an explanation of what's going on.

She called him and absolutely reamed him for it and now he's upset with me for involving his mother and for ""taking a video out of context."" I'm at my wits end and will probably leave him at this point, but AITA for sending the video?

AITA for not accommodating a vegan guest?,"Longtime lurker here. Hoping some of you guys can weigh in on what has become a really frustrating situation with a close friend and his partner.

So my wife (29F) and I (29M) have been hosting dinner parties a few times a year for as long as we've lived in our current city. We like to go all out and cook elaborate multi-course meals, so we limit our invitations to just a few close friends, since cooking such a complex dinner is an all-day affair and the food costs add up quickly. We have about four to six people we invite to these events, depending on their availability, and it's become a great tradition in our social circle. 

Our friend James started dating his girlfriend Sarah about a year and a half ago, and when we first extended her an invitation, we were informed that Sarah was vegan. I thanked James for letting us know and said she was more than welcome to bring her own food so she would have something to eat. He agreed, and the two of them have been attending our parties regularly for the past year. Everything was fine, until now.

During our most recent dinner this past week, we noticed that Sarah was very quiet and looked like she was about to cry. My wife asked her what was wrong, but she told us not to worry about it and kept dodging the question, so we didn't push the issue. 

However, after the meal, James took us aside privately and told us that Sarah felt hurt because we never provided any dishes she could eat at our dinners and it seemed like we were deliberately excluding her. He added that he thought we were being rude and inconsiderate by not accommodating her, which really pissed me off, and we got into a huge argument over it. 

My wife feels terrible that Sarah was so upset and apologized to her and James profusely, but I don't agree that we did anything wrong. I like Sarah very much as a person and I don't have anything against her dietary choices, but I don't believe it's fair to expect us to change our entire menu or make an entire separate meal for one person, especially when so much time and effort goes into creating these dinners. For the record, nobody else has any dietary restrictions. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for naming my dog Askim?,"8 years ago I got a gorgeous chug. While extremely high I decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is Askim, because when people ask me his name and I tell them about 50% of the time they'll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it's name. It's hilarious. 
I had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. Occasionally I'll be chatting to someone that hasn't met Askim yet and when they ask his name I have my little laugh but other than that it's a dead joke. 
Well, I just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. An elderly lady asked Askim's name, said ""what?"" So I repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. I quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. Since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they ""heard about my joke"" and that they didn't appreciate pranks in a nice family park.

I honestly don't get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog's dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction I'll accept your judgement on it.

EDIT: it's a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, I'll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.

I should have been clearer, but I guess I didn't know how to spell it out until I saw you guys suggest it. I absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that I made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought I did that intentionally. This is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.

The truth is that I say the word ""Askim"" multiple times a day. I'm aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it's just a thing I call my dog. When going out I'm not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and I wasn't trying to trick her, It was small talk and I didn't even  think about it until I got a negative reaction. 

It's been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and I know from personal experience that it's very true. I really like the idea of posting an explanation on the community Facebook page, especially now that I know it's Turkish meaning and that it's a town in Norway and neighborhood in Sweden.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for yelling at a little girl to get out of my face,"My newborn's pediatrician is always so crowded in terms of size of waiting room versus number of people waiting. It requires a certain amount of etiquette re: controlling your fuck kid, because there are no toys, no play area, no real space for shenanigans. 

Enter lady with four kids: A newborn, two toddlers, and a kindergarten aged kid (little girl in question here). She really really should have brought an iPad or a second adult or something because her kids were literally running around this tiny ass space, yelling and screeching. The mom was oblivious to all of her kids except the newborn, who was quietly breastfeeding while mom was glued to her phone screen. Accordingly, other people were put in the awkward position of having to discipline her kids. Several people had previously tried to put her kids back in line for whatever issue (harassing their kids, being loud, whatever).

Her kindergarten aged daughter, who clearly had some kind of special needs, was absolutely enamored with my newborn and his stroller. She was asking me if she could push it around (no) she was getting super close to my newborn (stop) and was generally just being annoying. Ffs at one point when I wasn't looking and was preoccupied with my own kid, she went digging in my diaper bag and throwing my stuff onto the chair and the floor. My newborn was really fussy because we were there for a sick visit and he wasn't feeling well, and I DID NOT feel like entertaining some strange kid. 

I tried being polite about it ""Sweetie where's your mommy?"" -points to mom- ""Ma'am!"" -points to kid- The lady would call her kid back, but the kid just kept coming back to me. Rinse and repeat. I told her she needed to stay with her mom. Little punk deadass says ""I don't wanna"" and keeps trying to touch my son, my stroller, our stuff. 


Finally, I'm trying to fix a bottle of formula while holding a screaming baby and listening to this little girl like a broken record ""why is your baby crying? Why is your baby crying! make him stop! I don't like that"" And her and her annoying self knocks my bottle of formula off the table and into my stroller. So now I'm out formula, kid still screaming, and I have a huge mess that I don't have a great way to clean up. 

I'm at my wits end. I raise my voice at this kid. ""LOOK WHAT YOU DID. I AM NOT YOUR MOM, I AM NOT YOUR BABYSITTER. YOU ARE BOTHERING ME. GET OUT OF MY FACE!!"" 

People looked at me like I was the biggest bitch on earth. A lady speaking Spanish actually did call me a bitch. The little girl starts crying. I'm not apologizing. The mom confronts me, I tell her she should have been watching her kid and that's the hill I'm prepared to die on.

My favorite joke: Everyone Knows Dave,"Dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""You know, I know everyone there is to know. Just name someone, anyone, and I know them.""

Tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""OK, Dave, how about Tom Cruise?""

""No dramas boss, Tom and I are old friends, and I can prove it.""
So Dave and his boss fly out to Hollywood and knock on Tom Cruise's door, and Tom Cruise shouts,

 ""Dave! What's happening? Great to see you! Come on in for a beer!""

Although impressed, Dave's boss is still skeptical. After they leave Cruise's house, he tells Dave that he thinks him knowing Cruise was just lucky.

""No, no, just name anyone else,"" Dave says.

""President Obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""Yup,"" Dave says, ""Old buddies, let's fly out to Washington,"" and off they go. 

At the White House, Obama spots Dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""Dave, what a surprise, I was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

Well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
After they leave the White House grounds he expresses his doubts to Dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""Pope Francis,"" his boss replies.

""Sure!"" says Dave. ""I've known the Pope for years."" So off they fly to Rome.

Dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the Vatican's St. Peter's Square when Dave says, ""This will never work. I can't catch the Pope's eye among all these people. Tell you what, I know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and I'll come out on the balcony with the Pope.""
He disappears into the crowd headed towards the Vatican.

Sure enough, half an hour later Dave emerges with the Pope on the balcony, but by the time Dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

Making his way to his boss' side, Dave asks him, ""What happened?""

AITA for having sex with my sister in law on the wedding night.,"Hey reddit,

I was best man for my brothers wedding, the maid of honor was his brides sister.  I am 24m while the sister (katie) was 20f.  We really hit it off right away.  We study the same subject in school, shes witty and funny and we got along really well.

Day of the wedding my brother and dad pull me aside and give me strict orders not to talk or initiate anything with katie.  I said that would be hard as we literally walk up the aisle together.  He said that was fine but other than that no contact, he then turned to me and said ""This is my day, I can tell you like her by the way you guys, stop being so selfish bro and be a good brother for once in your life"" This shocked me as we had a good relationship but i get he was stressed.

Wedding was going well and I obeyed them for the first part of the day, she wanted to dance but I said no.  She looked hurt and confronted me when I was getting a drink.  She said ""We were having so much fun before the day of the wedding, what changed?  I really like you and want to get to know you better, do you feel the same way""?  I said yes, and apologized and we danced.

"Reddit is not a bastion of free speech, and is actually highly censored by the wrong people.","Hear me out.

I originally came here because I heard that Reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. That was a lie.

Subreddit communities can make lists of rules and whatnot to make clear what kind of things they don't want on their sub, and that's okay.

The problem with the rules and independent moderation of Reddit is that, subs are just using their lists of rules as generalizations which in turn become excuses to censor people who don't agree with them. 

Generally, once you start talking about things that rustle the mods' jimmies, they will ban you. It doesn't matter if you've broken one of their rules or not, they'll just pick the rule they think is closest to what you're saying and use that as their excuse. Worse yet, sometimes they don't even give a reason, or they flat out admit they just don't like what you're saying. 

Most moderators just want safe spaces. They usually don't even want a safe space for their audience, they just want safe spaces for themselves, because god forbid you post something they disagree with in their subreddit, whether  you're breaking the rules or not, they'll find a reason to get rid of you.

All of this is made worse by the fact that generally the ones censoring are heavily liberal, as most people that use Reddit are. (Being liberal is okay, I'm a moderate, so I don't really care). Both sides of the political spectrum have both good and bad ideas, but only a weak person would try to censor everything that doesn't agree with their liberal agenda. I've seen conservatives do it too. Just not as much. Sometimes the censorship isn't even politically motivated, people just get butthurt.

The icing on the cake is that Reddit administrators are extremely liberal and will always 100% side with mods, especially if they're trying to create a safe space. 

Reddit puts on this mask of ""the last bastion of free speech on the internet "" when in reality they're creating the biggest censorship atrocity on the internet. I have faith in time it will die.

Censorship will kill Reddit.

Safe spaces will kill Reddit. 

Cancerous moderation will kill Reddit.

Admins who side with the more socially acceptable will kill Reddit.


Edit: By ""Moderate"" I'm saying that I'm in the middle, I base my political beliefs on what I think is right, and I don't agree wholeheartedly with either party. Both have great and terrible beliefs. I go with logic and empathy over blindly siding with one side of a spectrum. I'm pretty sure that's what moderate means, but some people seem to think moderate is something else. I'm just clearing that up.",unpopularopinion

I called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . He seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  He said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. I sat her down and we talked. All she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . I tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. I asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. She said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. Now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . So I did. She kept changing subjects or saying that "" A mother just feels it. You wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". She got very agitated and was crying telling me that if I wanted to leave her i should simply leave but I shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200B;

Somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

After she did i went on her computer. I do **never** snoop on her. But i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . Oh boy. She was in 2 facebook groups. One was a normal Mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. In the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. They were feeding in each others delusions. A woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. My wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. So many women were making her fear that i would leave. Saying things like men can not stick to a woman . Many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

I was really fucking scared. I researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of [schizophrenia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3361851/). So to say the least i could not sleep. I was and am still very afraid of losing her. She woke up and I tried to act like nothing was wrong . We were going to the doctor. And it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. She was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. Things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. He was really tactful when talking to my wife. He tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. We tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. She got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . She began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . We could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . She could not breathe. The doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . She had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. Did an EKG to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

At that point i really had no other option than to inquire about Involuntary commit. So I could not do it myself . I needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . After that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". So far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . My wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. When i last her she was furious with me. She said i was taking away her freedom which I am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. She is so mad at me. I feel like I am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. I love her with all my heart. I am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . I feel like i failed to protect her. At this point I am just rambeling . Sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . I feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . Sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : I will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! When I gave my vows I meant trough illness and bad times. I am not only on the ride for the good times. If you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. Would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? I am here to stay. I will not divorce her. She is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. I hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

Sorry for the rant. But if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. I understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it Beginns to mess with their mental health  and I respect that but I won't do that.

Edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. She was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

I don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as I was so distraught. But I was not a sedative. I think it was something along the lines of Valium or Baldrian. Over the counter stuff mostly.

She has family. She is estranged from most of them. Her sister is now at our place to help.

Also refrain from such stupid comments like ""I'll bet she will leave bro. She is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. Specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. Just seems like you want me to divorce. Get a life.",relationship_advice

TIFU: chatting with my Gynaecologist,"So, I went in for a routine lady checkup right. These visits are awkward from start to finish... The hype yourself up to be able to leave the house, the play-it-cool conversation before taking your pants off.. and oh god, the cleaning beforehand. Pretty sure I've discovered a new layer of skin from all the scrubbing. Pubic hair? What is that. 

So, enter the doc's office. Awkward prelims, tick. Pants off, tick. On the table (please tell me this piece of disposable paper has been changed since the last patient) MY ASS IS VULNERABLE RIGHT NOW

Fast forward to the speculum *shivers* now it's just silence. Silence and this guy, just having a stare off with my lady taco. After a few horrifying silent seconds, I decide it would be a good idea to make small talk. (only god knows why) Clearly out of creative ideas, I blurted ""a lot of cobwebs up there"" 

The doc stops moving and chuckles awkwardly.. after what feels like an eternity he says, ""not having an active sex life then?"" 

AWESOME. NO. I MEANT THE CEILING!!! YOUR CEILING. NOT MY VAGINA. *Crawls into a hole and dies*

For some reason he thought this was way funnier then I did. So yep. Should I change gynaecologists, can't bear to 'face' him again.  üòÖüòÖ

My (26M) girlfriend (24F) found an engagement ring I was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. She thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.,"I've been dating my girlfriend Laura for just over two years. We met as I was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. We have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and I love her a great deal. She's definitely been the healthiest relationship I've ever had and I see a strong future with her. 

This weekend has been awful, however. My best friend Rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend Grace of about seven years. The problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. I offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. I hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last Monday when he asked for it back. He (successfully!) proposed to Grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

Literally five minutes after she posted, Laura rang me absolutely fuming. She told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had I given it to Rob for Grace when I'd clearly chosen it especially for her? Was Grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? I tried to talk her down and explain that I'd just been keeping it safe for Rob and that I'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that I'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. She hung up on me, then texted me that I had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than Grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

Am I wrong for thinking this is a red flag? I know that she probably was really excited and I absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. We don't live together and I don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. More than that, I am 100% not ready for marriage. We've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. I want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

What do I do? I totally understand why she'd be upset but I just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that I'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. This is the first big fight we've had and I'm not sure if I'm just seeing red flags because I'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

TL;DR: Girlfriend snooped and found a ring that I was keeping safe for a friend. She's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by Valentine's day or the relationship's off. Need help determining what my next move should be.",relationship_advice

"Men face a more unrealistic standard of beauty than women, they just don't complain about it.","You hear it every day. Women complaining about the unrealistic standard of beauty they are faced with. They act like its women and only women. 

Well, hello Brad Pitt, Ryan Reynolds, Ryan Gosling, Chris hemsworth, Jason momoa, dwayne Johnson, John cena, Channing Tatum, etc, etc...the list goes on.

The ""standard"" women face is for the most part weight. Most overweight people have the ability to exercise and diet to cut their weight, and although theres a rare few who have conditions causing their obesity, most of them are just too lazy and lack the discipline to drop the pounds. Plus there's all of those ""love your body"" campaigns trying to make overweight women feel like they're ""good enough"". At least they have makeup as a viable option.

 Sure losing weight is hard but let's look at what men are facing.

Let's start with height. Gotta be 6ft or taller. 5'11 doesnt cut it, and apparently they can tell the difference. I'm kidding, they cant, but if they ask you, and you're 5'10 or 5'11, you better lie because apparently those few inches are a deal breaker. Men face the SAME struggle with weight, *Billy May's voice* -- but wait, theres more! Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a ripped body like all those male celebs that parade around shirtless in the movies? Its REALLY fucking hard. For some people, it's not even possible. It goes beyond weight. Female celebs get boob jobs, ass jobs, etc, which any woman can get, but the men have to train for years to get the body you see in movies and magazines. To top it off, we cant wear makeup either. Not that we want to, but as a man you have to show every flaw you have, yet they call that plus sized female model who couldn't put down the fork the brave one.

So please, stop acting like women are the only one facing an unrealistic standard. Sure men could complain, but complaining about it would make them seem like less of a man, so I guess that's another thing to add to the list.",unpopularopinion

"My husband put his dick in my cup of water, and didn't tell me.","Okay, this is not a shitpost. I wish it was. I'm deeply disturbed. 

The other night after sex, as my husband and I were getting up and dressed, I asked if he could grab me a glass of ice water. He was on his way out of the room, and said sure. He wasn't mad about it, and sex was fine. We weren't fighting and had been having a pretty good week. 

As I walk into the kitchen he hands me the glass of water. 

I don't know what came over me, but I got this sixth sense, I don't know how else to describe it. Maybe it was his shiteating grin, but I flat out asked him, did you put your dick in this?

He looked shocked and taken aback by my question and for a split second I thought maybe I was being an idiot. 

He then says, how did you know?!?!

I was furious but it was such a strange situation so I just dumped it out and brushed it off. I didn't know what else to do. 

The next day I asked him about it, and I asked why he did it. He said, I don't know.  

I told him that it kind of made me upset, like I can't trust him to get me a glass of water. It hurt my feelings. He immediately got defensive. 

We got into a fight about trust and he didn't understand what the big deal was. I said, so what? Do you put my toothbrush in the toilet when we fight??

He said no of course not, but he had that same shiteating grin. 

I don't know if he'd ever do that, and maybe it was just the way I phrased it or that the fight was about him putting his dick in my glass of water. But, like wtf?

I don't know what to think. 

Am I overreacting?

EDIT:

For those asking, we've been married almost 10 years now. He's 34, I'm 32. 

Honestly I didn't expect for this to blow up. I wrote a quick post and went to bed.

Thank you to everyone responding/giving advice and input, I'm trying to respond to as much as I can. 

Here's my takeaway: 

Some people, mostly men, are saying it was just a practical joke or a prank.

But here's the thing, he didn't mean for me to find out. I asked him straight up and he told that he wasn't going to say anything. No harm done! That he thought it was funny and that he didn't know why he did it. He just did. 

So to me, it wasn't done in a joking manner. 

After thinking about it, it's more of a consent issue. To those asking, sure we just had sex and yes I suck his dick sometimes...but this is different. He violated boundaries and I feel upset about that.

UPDATE:

Whether we can all agree to disagree about it being a joke or not, it was disgusting, disrespectful and crossed a line.

I'm going to talk to him later about boundaries and what not.",relationship_advice
"AITA for asking for pocket money because ""I am a kid too""","I am 19F, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. I am still studying so I cannot pay rent yet, but I do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


My father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. They have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. That plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. I had been arranged to join the kids' group, when I tried to protest they insist that I am a ""kid"" too, so I just had to submit to my fate. Clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


So I spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. That includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to Science Park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. To be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when I sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(I admit, I am not really babysitter material). The kids seem to like me, so I guess it went well too. However, I still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


When my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. Almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. Now, I don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes I can easily earn in a few hours, but I am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, I was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


I put on the biggest smile I and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. They were a little taken aback. I said as sweetly as I could that I deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. In all awkwardness I got my pocket money. Needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.

"My bf's mom wants his birthday dinner to be ""family only"", as in I'm not invited. Am I wrong to feel a bit miffed?","I've been dating my bf for 3 years.  He turns 40 today.  With help from his mother....I threw him a surprise party this weekend.  His family, a few from my family and mutual friends.  The party was awesome.  Now today is his actual birthday and last week his mom mentioned we would do family dinner on the night of his actual birthday.  I reached out to her and said we could do it at our place if that was easier since our place is a bit bigger then his moms house.  She said she would get back to me.

So my bf just let me know that tonight is ""family only"" at his moms house.  Meaning myself and his sisters husband aren't invited.  Just parents and the three kids (him, sister and brother).  I dunno...I feel a little offended?  We're shopping for engagement rings right now...so I will be family.  I thought I was family.  I'm not one to make a big deal over things but this feels like a bit of a power play since I was sorta in charge of the surprise party this weekend.  Does this deserve some attention or just leave this one alone and let them have family time?

Edit: some suggested I mention that there are different languages involved.  My bf and his brother speak fluent English and Spanish, mom speaks Spanish but very good English, dad speaks Spanish but very little English, the sister speaks English, Spanish to her dad and Portuguese to her husband, the husband speaks Portuguese, some Spanish, broken English.  I'm the of bird out with just English a little Spanish. When we go out all together (minus dad) we usually converse in English but mom will switch to Spanish if she's tired or can't find the words to say something.  My bf will usually translate for me so I don't feel left out.  When dad is around it's primarily Spanish and sometimes I get translations and sometimes I don't.  I can sometimes follow a conversation if the speech is slow enough but can't really answer beyond basic words in Spanish.

UPDATE: I just got a call from my bf's mom.  Apparently when she told him in Spanish that the night would be family only he misunderstood thinking it was only the kids and parents.  She said she never meant that and was expecting the two of us.  My bf is getting a smack when he gets home. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",relationship_advice

I'm driving down a country road with a posted 55 speed limit. Cop car gets in behind me. Bad experiences with cops so I do everything by the books, change to the right lane and use autopilot to maintain the exact speed limit, letting the cop pass.

Cop changes to my lane and starts tailgating instead of passing. I maintain speed limit. After several minutes, the lights and sirens go on and I get pulled over. They search my car and repeatedly make me do several sobriety tests.

A lady at my gym suffered a seizure in the woman's locker room - she's now threatening to sue. I am 16 years old.,"(Pennsylvania) Hi there,

I am a 16 year old Junior in high school and work part-time at a gym.  I generally open the gym on weekends at 7 AM, and am alone in the building until our housekeeping staff come in at 8:00.
It starts out slow as members come in, and usually picks up around 9 when our Sales staff and General Manager come in.  The gym is a two story facility.

Earlier this morning around 8ish, I was approached by another member who stated there was a woman in the locker room (downstairs) who was laying on a bench shaking and presumably having a seizure.  So I RUN downstairs to the locker room, and sure enough, there is a woman shaking uncontrollably, but breathing.  I had my cell phone with me and immediately called 911.  I stayed on the phone with the dispatcher while waiting for the EMTs and Paramedics who arrived about five minutes later.

The dispatcher stated I should absolutely NOT try to perform CPR/First Aid (I am licensed) or move her, only to hold on to her make sure she did not fall off the bench.  The EMT's manage to revive? (I'm not sure if that is the appropriate term here) her and she gets wheeled out of the gym and to the hospital. I'd say we were in the locker room for about 20 minutes trying to convince her to go -- she was VERY stubborn.  There was a personal trainer who was there to help me with whom I am EXTREMELY grateful for.  I filled out an Incident report and filed it with our GM when he came in.

We have had concerns with this member before, as she has health issues.  The thing is, I have absolutely no idea how long she was suffering from a seizure for.  It looked as if she was in the midst of changing in to gym gear when it happened.  She checked in shortly after 7:15 AM.

I just received a text message from my GM and she is now threatening to sue us for her seizure.  Can she come after me personally??  As I said, I have no idea how long she was in that state for and I am terrified!  Thank you in advance for your answers!",legaladvice

I guess I'll be jumping ship soon anyways. The place is falling apart and the owners can't figure anything out. If any employee in any department left right now it'd be disastrous for the restaurant. I already know that at least two other vital employees are planning to quit pretty soon as well because of how undervalued we all are. The owners have zero grasp of the concept of morale and how much it affects your business and the loyalty of your employees. I'll be happy to leave this place behind me and watch it crumble shortly thereafter.

"AITA for refusing to use the money I inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? She is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.","When I was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. In one split second, the happy family I knew was gone, and I went through the darkest time in my life.

My parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). She never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship I wanted to have with him. I eventually forgave my dad mostly because I was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. I talk to him but I want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

My mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which I now own and operate. I am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. He was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

This year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. The bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

The thing is, I don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. Though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when I think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and I have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. I'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. They are her parents after all.

My wife is of the timid type and didn't want a conflict so she took the reduced winnings and had a few choice words but otherwise didn't contest it. They gave the rest to Jessica. They made up a fake story to her that they made a 2nd place prize on the spot and Jessica won it, thanks to the generosity of my wife and I. This was all bogus.

We made a post on our community Facebook page saying we had a great time at the competition but didn't appreciate the comments we received or how we were treated. I guess Jessica's family got wind of this and contacted my wife to meet up earlier today.

Jessica's family gave us the money back and while they were excited at first, couldn't take it under false pretenses. They found it condescending to give Jessica a prize just for having ASD. It was a joint decision between Jessica and her parents.

We talked a bit and learned Jessica only joined because she's writing a cookbook for an Asperger's Syndrome organization. She's apparently an avid cook and has trouble keeping everything consistent every time, so it's half for her and half for this organization. Part of why she went to the competition is to raise awareness of the cookbook itself as well as ASD/ASS and hopefully win, of course. We didn't know any of this at all, and I guess this is why the organizers wanted good PR.

My wife asked her if there was anything she could do and she can. She's going to help out where she can or if Jessica needs assistance. Things like editing, photography, etc. I guess everything turned out okay for everyone in the end, except my contempt for the competition organizers.

PS: [Here](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bihmbc/aita_for_not_sharing_my_prize_with_a_mentally/em15ywu/)'s the recipe I used, a lot of people asked for it in the previous thread.

PPS: Yes, I know ""mentally handicapped"" isn't the right verbiage. I've learned a lot about ASD in the last few days. I only kept it to be congruent with the previous post. Autism and Asperger's in particular may not always or ever be a mental handicap, I should have said disabled instead judging by a few comments.",AmItheAsshole

"AITA for keeping my grandmothers ring when it was given to me by ""mistake""?","My grandmother passed earlier this year and she had a pretty nice jewelry collection. Before she passed she knew what went to who and had had me meet to see what I'd like. Instead of jewelry I asked for her wedding dress. No one else wanted it, I had gotten married in it, and she was really touched. After talking to her kids she went ahead and gave it to me before passing. 

When she did pass away I was surprised she hadn't written down who got what pieces. Since I had already passed on inheritance of a piece I didn't go to the meeting with the rest of the family. Basically they sat down and went oldest to youngest and let each person pick until there were no pieces. From what I heard it was peaceful and everyone was happy. 

Since I wasn't there they still wanted me to have something and picked a ring they thought had fake diamonds. It was the biggest and they assumed it was a diamond substitute. It was sweet of them to do that, so I could have a piece of her everyday too. 

When I got the ring I didn't examine it. It was big enough I thought it was fake too. But then I saw a diamond on the inside band (indicating Leo diamonds). I took it to get it evaluated and it has real diamonds. It's value is about 5k more than her next expensive piece (they had the papers on all of those). Essentially I got a nicer and more expensive piece than even her oldest daughter. But they chose it for me. 

Now, they want to redo the distribution. But I feel like it's fair. I didn't ask for anything, they gave me something anyways, now they realize the value of it and want it back. AITA if I refuse?

WIBTA if I cancelled the adoption of my stepdaughter?,"Using throwaway 


So as the title suggests, I'm currently in the process of adopting my stepdaughter.



Me and her mom have been married a year and the daughter was the product of a horribly abusive ex-husband. This abuser was still in their lives when we were dating and I used lawyers and the courts to slowly push him out where he has no control over their lives and he is starting to give up fighting the adoption because I'm set to win in a few months.



Now because of personal issues of our own, my wife has just told me that she wants to file for divorce, but that she wants to wait until after I adopt our kid.



When I told her that I was afraid of adopting our daughter because of the child support I'll have to pay and not being a family anymore (which is why I wanted to in the first place) she had a full panic attack and accused me of leaving her in her abuser's control.



For info, the daughter is 5 and calls me dad.



So reddit, WIBTA if I told my lawyer to stop the adoption process if I knew my wife was going to leave me after?


Edit: Wow this really blew up. To give answers to some repeated questions/comments:

Yes I know the ex-husband is abusive for a fact, no this is not about the money her panic attack was about the control her ex has, and I will not even entertain the idea of suing for full custody myself.


Edit 2: Went out for a few drinks because I needed them because of all of this. 


Wife had just been diagnosed with some mental struggles and her therapist urged her to allow the meds to take effect before she made a major life decision.


I was originally leaning towards adoption because I love that little girl and we get along almost better than her and her mom but after reading the almost 2400 comments at this point and roughly 200-300 pms I've decided to talk to a lawyer when I get home to make an informed decision.",AmItheAsshole

The problem with dicussion on reddit is that negative karma encourages people to stop debating and go to subreddits that agree with them.,"Negative karma discourages people from arguing against the majority view on a subreddit and instead going to a different subreddit where they are the majority view.

This happens because when you share these unpopular opinions; your comments get hidden making it harder for people to listen to what you say, especially for new users without much karma it can very easy to get banned, and users with unpopular opinions face a very hostile reaction in those subreddits.

Unfortunately there is an easy alternative, where you run to a subreddit which is the complete opposite, the majority agrees with you on your statements, you have the support of the community and positive reinforcement where people encourage you on.

This is poor for dicussion for many reasons but undoubtedly the most important is that people aren't as challenged on their ideas and beliefs drastically lowering the overall quality of discussion.

I would argue that my position is a minority argument and that most redditors would instead put the discussion problem down to the nature of argument on the site being very reactionary, with relatively little knowledge on the given subject matter.

AITA for /how/ I told someone I would not give up my handicap spot?,"This is a throwaway account.

&#x200B;

For background, I (22F) am very petite, fit, and just by looking at me one would not guess I have a physical disability. 2 weeks ago, I had surgery with incisions on my spine and one butt cheek making walking more difficult temporarily. Though, I have a handicap placard not just because I had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable to walk long distances.

I'm not asking AITA for refusing to give up my spot, but because of what I said. My brother thinks I went too far, but I think I afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.

&#x200B;

I was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) I pulled into one of 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out. We waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. I got out of the car and asked her if she would close her door.

&#x200B;

The woman immediately started berating me, saying I had no right to use the handicap spot as other people ""that actually need it"" would be unable to park. Apparently, I am young and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn't know what my disability is) and deal with parking far away. She called me an entitled brat and accused me of ""scamming the government to support \[my\] lazy ass,"" among other things. I told her a doctor saw fit I get a handicap placard, and when she said I look ""fine"" I told her that my medical history is none of her business. She continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point, and refused to close her door.

&#x200B;

I eventually had enough and let her have it. I told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn't eat yourself into debilitating obesity others 'that actually need it' would be able to use your spot. She tried to respond by saying her weight was due to medical issues, to which I cut her off to say if she's going to make assumptions about me I will do the same. I called her a miserable old bitter bitch and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business. She threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize and I told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and told her to send them in.

&#x200B;

When my brother heard this he finally crawled out of the driver's side. He said something like calm down and let's go inside, and I said that sounds like a great idea if the nosy bitch will leave us alone, but she seems too fat to follow up with the police and bring them inside. Then we walked away with her still yelling things at me with her door open. She either didn't call the police or they refused to come.

&#x200B;

I know what I said was harsh but I'm pretty tired of people making assumptions about my pain and telling me about my pain. Maybe I should regret it, but I don't have an ounce of remorse for what I said. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

LPT: Your hearing is not invincible. Please lower your volume when listening to music. Bring earplugs to concerts. Do not make the same mistake I made.,"Your hair cells are fragile. Protect them. I made the mistake of listening to music and pretty much anything at unsafe levels. Now, I pay the price of having an endless phantom ringing noise in my ear, also known as tinnitus.

This will get lost, but, at the very least, some people will see this and correct this mistake I made. 

Here is a [link to relative noise volumes](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/Training/PPETrain/dblevels.htm). Also, when you're outside in a bustling city or on a subway, you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you; don't do this. 

For those who don't know what [tinnitus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIAjJogJ0cs) is. There are many forms of tinnitus. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qOMgLa_o) is but one of them. 

EDIT: I'm glad this is reaching many people. If you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. I often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. If you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. If you google ""tinnitus definition"" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately. 

""[The U.S. Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public ‚Äî over 50 million Americans ‚Äî experience some form of tinnitus. Roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.](https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)"" 

Stay safe everyone. 

EDIT 2: Hello everyone, I've been seeing a lot of post here. Thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. Just a few things to keep in mind. Not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. Tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have TMJ. In these cases they may or may not be permanent (I don't want to scare you), and I would highly recommend going to your ENT (Ear, Nose, and Throat Doctor) as soon as possible. Also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. This is important to remember. See your ENT to get these ruled out! 

As /u/OhCleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. This is how you cause earwax blockage. 

Edit3: I've been reading all of your comments. Here I will include some notable suggestions I've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, . 

2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears. 

3) **there are earplugs called ~~""Etymotic""~~(just search for ""earplugs that don't muffle sound"") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks. 

/u/ukralibre said ""Thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed."" However, by then it'll be too late. Take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this LPT. 

Edit 4: I put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. It can lead to hyperacusis. You want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise. 

Edit 5: For many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. Have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? Or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just ""disappears"". Same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.

Our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as [brain plasticity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaDlLD97CLM). Your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. I know how ludicrous this sound, but I have I personally have habituated to the sound myself, and I'm pretty much back to my normal life. Things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your T. For now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). As always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless.

[Update] My landlord thinks I have a dog named Steve,"Sorry - forgot to link my last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9spqbh/ny_im_being_evicted_for_violating_my_apartments

So - first off I wasn't totally honest about my relationship with my landlord. This was probably pretty obvious the more I commented but we're actually really close friends. Like I spend holidays with his family. So yeah, that's how I knew he wasn't just fucking me over to get more money. 


Anyway, I met with a lawyer. I like him. He basically said the same thing as everyone here - NYC is really tenant friendly, and if this makes it to court (unlikely, you'll see why) it won't be hard to fight. I don't think I'd want to fight though. I probably have nothing to worry about but I would just peacefully move if it does happen. 


The rest of this update isn't very legal. Sorry if that's against the rules. 


So - I ended up calling 311 instead of Adult Protective Services since Google gave me a few different numbers. I must have described the situation really badly because they transferred me to Animal Care and Control twice and then I was distracted by a fire at work (that's not jargon - we were evacuated because of a fire on another floor. The story is they were making s'mores in a conference room). 


This wasn't a call I wanted to make surrounded by all of my coworkers while we stood around outside so I texted his sister instead and we made plans to talk later. Long story short, she'd gotten some weird messages from him lately (like him congratulating her on a promotion then getting angry when she had no idea what he was talking about). Once she heard about Steve and the eviction, she made plans to fly out to us the next day. 


This is getting long (sorry), so jumping a bit - she told him some story and convinced him to fly back to CA with her. Before he left he apologized for blowing up at me and said that we could talk about the dog when he got back and try to work it out but that it was shitty that I did it behind his back especially when it was against the lease and he couldn't rent to someone he couldn't trust. 


I asked his sister about the eviction (just in case) and she said of course I wasn't evicted and to just hold down the fort. 


Anyway - so he's at a place near his family being treated now. I don't know what for and I don't really care as long as he's getting better. That's his business and he'll tell me if he wants to. I just want him to be okay and it looks like he will be. 


(I do know it's nothing environmental because I've had the whole place tested for everything. Also I've been staying there and I'm still fine.) 


His family is awesome and reaching out to me almost daily. I haven't been able to talk to him since he left, but hopefully soon. I'm also going there for Thanksgiving so I'll most likely even get to see him. 


And when he's back we can maybe start looking for our new dog Steve.

I'm so tired of reddit's uncontrollable need to be the funny man in the comments no matter how serious the post may be.,"People on reddit have always had a great sense of humor to me, but sometimes the impulse to insert a joke or a pun or a series of weird strung along comments gets. fucking. old. 

Sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. And you just have to give credit where credits due. But lately I've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. Sometimes I feel like I should laugh at the cleverness of some. But it happens so often and in so many posts that I find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. Not unless there's just a golden moment. I've even begun to roll my eyes the moment I open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. I NEVER ROLL MY EYES. At anything. 

I used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately I've been really turned off by it. Maybe I just need a break.

Sometimes I really just wish the top comments had less to do with clever jokes and more to do with the content of that post...

AITA for telling my daughter [26F] that I [55M] will not walk down the aisle with her stepdad [50M].,"My wife and I divorced when my daughter was 6 years old, and my wife had custody of my daughter for the most part since I was too busy working 50 hours a week, she quickly moved on to be with another man 7 years younger than her.

This didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. My cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. We're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

I couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what I was seeing and I had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. Basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. The only realistic explanation for what I was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. Reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. All the dots lined up and I felt a sense of *loss*. I sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then I had a feeling of anger come over me. I needed some fucking answers. 

Without even thinking, I rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. My mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. She had no idea my dad and I had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. My mother and I never had a 'traditional' relationship. She was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

My irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. I asked her if she cheated on dad with Uncle David (name changed for obv reasons). I have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. She looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""What kind of question is this? Of course not."" I told her everything; the test, percentages, DNA matches, ALL OF IT!! Shit hit the fan. My mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

I left her there and went back into my room. I called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. She ended the call screaming. Dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. I told him everything too. He didn't say anything after calming down. He left the room and I locked the door. 

For the next few hours, I heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. My parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. My aunt in law and David showed up shortly later and I'm pretty sure I heard my Dad and David get into some physical fight. Utter chaos. 

I feel like fucking shit. Ik it's not my fault but I can't help feeling that this is all because of me. If I had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. I'm too scared to go outside. I don't even know what the outcome was. The only noise I hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and I sure my dad is out of the house. Fuck my life

TLDR; Mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. I take a DNA test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. I've locked myself in my room and I'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

"You should be able to honestly tell your SO if they have gained weight to the point of you losing physical attraction towards them and you shouldn't be labelled as a ""bad person / a*hole/ etc"" if you do so.","**TLDR** : You should be able to straightforwardly AND respectfully express to your SO if they gained weight to the point you start losing desire for their body IF you both consider sex  and physical attraction vital for your relationship.

**Edit - before anything else PLEASE READ:** 

\- So, let me start by saying I deleted most of my text as those lines don't really serve purpose. They were indeed too long to even consider reading through. 

\- The other thing is: I have to admit that this post was rushed. And yes, I am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). The funny thing is that while I might think some commenters are oversensitive I have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and I can also get oversensitive. I don't regret what I wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. Some of you made the assumption that I must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. That's right. And sometimes I turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw I'm female for those who thought otherwise). The reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. I can understand that what I said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). And at the end I'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. I should have considered more factors. I want to apologize about that honestly. So thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now I'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. I'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. So thank you for offering the experience. I appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. I'll try and digest them properly in the following days. I'm still think that I'm right about SOME aspects but not anymore do I believe my reasoning is flawless. I wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**Content:**

Honesty is NOT kindness. Honesty is honesty. Period. I don't mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn't put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. You can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. If you can't take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. And yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

You can't just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

Your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ""soft"") - and how you react to that is YOUR responsibility. The partner doesn't have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it's a sensitive topic to you. I wonder why it's so sensitive‚Ä¶

Also,  check with the shelter staff about obedience training. They often know good schools or sometimes even do it in house. 

Please adopt responsibly.

Im glad this LPT has reached so many people because that means so many people are more aware about the joy of adopting adult dogs from shelters, and it's also been great reading the comments about how people have adopted adult dogs and are so loving in their families.

I wanted to wait a few days before I updated you guys, just because it was a first date and we didn't know each other previously. I wanted her to still be talking to me for a few days afterwards.

&#x200B;

So, I picked her up from her house and I was in awe of how beautiful she looked. She got in and we figured out where to get fro yo, and when we got to the store, she asked me to read all the flavors to her. Of course, I did, then grabbed us some sample cups. She got pistachio, lavender blueberry, and either vanilla or classic tart. She left the last one a secret to me. I got classic tart and the lavender blueberry with some blueberries on top. We started the conversation on our frozen creations and delved into deeper conversation. Unfortunately, there were some loud little kids so we could barely hear each other, but we still enjoyed each other's company.  We got back in the car, and I went to drop her off, and she invited me in to watch a movie! She wanted to spend more time with me, yes!! She handed me the remote and said to pick whatever, so I picked one of my favorite scary movies, and started it. During the opening scene she brought up the fact if I've ever been around someone who couldn't see. I told her no, and we kinda got back into the movie, bringing up odd conversation here and there. After the movie, I went home, pretty giddy from the experience.

&#x200B;

We're still talking, thankfully, and we're planning on when to meet up next. She's just sick right now, so it's hard to plan around that. I'm excited for our next date!

"It has been 7 months since we learned that my wife (34F) can't have kids and she still has not ""gotten over"" it. I (35M) am seriously considering a divorce.","HAPPY UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy\_update\_it\_has\_been\_7\_months\_since\_we/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b3m2gk/happy_update_it_has_been_7_months_since_we/)  


Title may seem harsh so I apologize. Also using a throwaway because my friends know my real account.

Bit of background info about my wife: She's an only child and had a rather lonely childhood. So to her, having kids and watching them grow up together is an important issue for her, if not the single most important issue.

To make a long story short, 7 months ago we learned that my wife is incapable of having children. Of course both of us were devastated and she ended up leaving her job. For the first month after learning this terrible news, all she did was cry and watch Netflix in bed. I brought her meals in bed, started working from home, and gave her my full support because it was the least I could do.

But now it's 7 months later and she's still crying and watching Netflix in bed all day. I ask her every day if she needs anything but all I get in response is variations on either ""leave me alone"" or ""some peace and quiet"". Virtually the only times she gets out of bed are when she fixes herself some snacks, uses the bathroom, or takes a shower. I do all the cooking, cleaning, and laundry. I've suggested many things to help her recover, including but not limited to:

1. Therapy. She said that all therapists spew BS back at you.
2. Adoption or using a surrogate. She shot down both saying that it just didn't feel right to her.
3. Moving to her parents' city. She said moving 100 miles was too much stress.
4. Buying a corgi puppy (corgis are her favorite). She snapped at me saying that a puppy is no substitute for a real human child.
5. Taking her on a weeklong trip to anywhere she chooses. Again, she said that's too much stress.

Earlier tonight I had a talk with my wife. I told her that our relationship is just not sustainable if she continues to act this way and that she needs help. She said that she's fine and called me an asshole for suggesting that she get help.

Don't get me wrong, I love my wife with all my heart. I'm doing my best to help her, but she is refusing that help and in total denial. I know that she'll be devastated if we get a divorce but honestly I cannot bear living like this for much longer. What do (or can) I do?",relationship_advice
TIFU By Getting My Tonsils Removed,"I like many people in adulthood have had to deal with the annoyance of overgrown tonsils. From the 3 ‚Äì 4 times a year tonsillitis, to the sleep apnoea that they cause. Personally, I wanted my tonsils gone.

After getting tonsillitis for the second time this year I decided enough is enough, I booked an appointment with my GP, referred to the surgeon and made a date for the surgery.

I was warned that I was in for the sorest through of my life and that it was going to be agony for a while. Which was ok, how bad could it be?

Day 1: I was prepped and ready to go, surprisingly not too nervous for my first major surgery. The procedure went well, my tonsils were gone and I was all set to recover in hospital. The pain wasn't too high yet, I was still spaced out from the drugs, so all in all the first night was quite easy.

Day 2:

4AM: I woke up needing to go to the bathroom, I felt like I needed to spit so I rushed over to the bathroom sink. I spat out a few mouthfuls of blood not thinking too much of it. I slowly shuffled back to my bed and quickly fell back asleep.

7:30AM: This time I awoke to a lot of pain, I buzzed the nurse to get my dose of Endone and Panadol. I mentioned to her that I had bled a little overnight. She was immediately concerned, she passed me a plastic cup and told me to spit all the blood that comes up from now.

(I thought that leaking blood would be common as it was when I got my wisdom teeth out.)

For the next few hours slowly but surely I was filling up this cup that looked more and more like red wine. It was horrible because the pain was quite high regardless of the pain killers, I couldn't lie down an rest as the blood would go in to my stomach.

10PM: The nurses tried to use an ice pack on my neck and give me countless icy poles to freeze the blood but nothing was working, I had filled almost two cups now and they decided it was time to call my surgeon.
They broke the bad news to me and told me I needed to be prepped for surgery again. I was surprisingly ok with it. I remained calm and collected. I went through the procedure again of getting countless needles and being sedated. (FUN!)

Post second surgery: I was back where I was today but hopefully no more bleeding! The surgeon informed me that a blood vessel had haemorrhaged around my tonsil area causing blood to leak. I had to have blood sucked out of my stomach because I had indeed swallowed quite a bit of blood.

He told me that this complication only happens once a year for him! (Lucky me.)

Day 3-4:

The recovery was brutal and painful, I was in bed all day, struggling to get any solids down as the pain was too bad to swallow. However, no complications.

Day 5:
For anyone who has had the pleasure of having a tonsillectomy you would know the most painful part about it is waking up from a snooze.

I learnt that the best thing to do is get up, drink some water and have some meds ASAP!

I was getting out of the shower when I felt a large amount of liquid in my mouth, I leaned over the sink and spat out blood.

Here is a picture of the sink: https://m.imgur.com/kpxtoMf

My mum, who had been amazing throughout this whole thing, was luckily around the corner from my home when this happened. So I called her and we decided the safest bet would be returning to hospital.

I felt very unwell in the car ride, and I was pale as a ghost. They quickly put an IV in and gave me fluids.

After a VERY long wait we were advised by my surgeon to return home and come back in if it were to happen again.

I returned home and rested up for a few hours, it was around 9PM when I felt the same liquid taste in the back of my throat. This time I knew. I rushed to the bathroom and proceeded to cough up blood.

Here's a photo of this time: http://imgur.com/s2YFx39

As you can see, it's a lot more this time around.

I don't know if you have ever had the displeasure of coughing up blood but the worst part about it is just how sticky blood is. It sticks to your tongue, throat and lips, resulting in blood clots getting stuck in your mouth. It's horrible.

I called my mum and she rushed over to come get me.

Back to hospital again and another IV :)

I was admitted back to the ward and I stayed overnight, my night wasn't overly dramatic. I bled once around 3-4AM but it only lasted 5 minutes so there wasn't much for concern.

DAY 6!!!!

Things were looking ok, I was still in a lot of pain but I had not bled outside of the little one in the morning.

1PM: I was watching shitty daytime TV as I reached to have a sip of water, I felt that same feeling in my throat come on and it felt heavy quick.

I had no time to react so I grabbed the smoothie cup I had received from my mum and proceeded to spit mouthfuls of blood in to it. I was trying to get a hold of my buzzer to notify the nurse.

They came in shortly after and rushed to get me a vomit bag, it was coming FAST. The nurses were trying to keep me calm and they again put an ice pack behind my neck to try and slow down the bleeding. I kept coughing it up. I started making gagging noises as the blood was sticking and clotting around my throat.

I started to feel light headed. Within seconds of saying that, I fainted.

I woke up seconds later to the ward now being in Code Blue, I had never seen so many nurses and doctors in one room so fast. There must have been 15-20 people in this small room. I had needles going in to my arms, an oxygen mask being put on, and multiple nurses and doctors talking to me.

""Raph, stay with us.""

""Raph, look at me, keep your eyes open.""

This was the first time in my life that I was genuinely scared for my life.

I could overhear that they were trying to get a hold of my surgeon, because once again I needed emergency surgery.

I was rushed into theatre and they prepped me again. Giving me another IV there was a delay because my surgeon was finishing up surgery for another patient at another hospital.

It was at this moment where I broke down crying. I felt so sick, all I could taste was blood, I was scared, alone. I didn't know what was going to happen to me. All the while I was still coughing up a lot of blood.

After some time had passed, the nurse with me was starting to panic.

""We need to get him into theatre now!""

They kept trying to give me oxygen but I kept coughing blood into the mask.

My surgeon arrived and I was put to sleep.

I woke up in unbearable pain and agony, it was the worst pain I had felt since this whole thing began. But that quickly changed when I was given morphine.

I rested up and was eventually moved back into the ward and I was greeted by my mum and nan. My poor mother had been through hell. She had only just before it all went down. She was bawling her eyes out the whole time I was going through it all, blaming herself for leaving :(

Day 7:

I got a big sleep and I woke up to my surgeon checking in on me. He was truly sorry for my ordeal, and said I was the worst he had ever seen.

The cause was the same as last time, a vessel had opened up and caused the bleeding.

All in all I lost 800ml of blood from that ordeal. That's almost a fifth of total blood!

It's crazy to think that if I wasn't in the ward when it happened there was a good chance I could have died.

Day 8-9:

I stayed in hospital. Everyone agreed that it was the best place for me, just in case thunder struck three times.

I was pretty shook on Day 8 still, but as soon as word got out that it went from standard procedure to almost fatal I was receiving a lot of love from my family and friends.

Twitch kept me sane throughout my stay. All my streaming buddies reached out and wished me well which all contributed to making me feel better.

Day 10:

I am typing to you all from my phone! This is probably the longest thread I have ever written on Reddit and I don't normally post much but I wanted to share my story because this will stick with me for the rest of my life.

Each day I'm feeling more and more strong. My pain still sucks but it's getting less severe and I haven't bled since! I'm out of hospital being taken very well taken care of by my mother.

As clich√© as it sounds, this whole experience made me very grateful not only for my life, but more importantly the doctors, nurses, surgeons, paramedics etc. that go through so much stress to help us fellow humans live the lives we live.

I can't wait to be back in full health and hopefully I can play some games and get some streams in before I go back to work! ;)

TL;DR: I got the procedure of getting my tonsils out. Unfortunately due to complications I needed multiple emergency surgeries. After a few days of rest from the second procedure, I started to bleed excessively. Which quickly made me faint turning the hospital into a code red state. I lost a significant amount of blood and I was prepped for a third and final procedure that saved my life.

EDIT: A small amount of you requested my Twitch, here it is: twitch.tv/wristyplum :)

Thankyou so much for all the kind words. I really did not expect this to blow up as it has. Y'all are so nice!

EDIT 2: You guys have asked for an update so here it is:

I'm feeling so much better, the pain is no where near as bad! Today was the first day I woke up and didn't straight away need painkillers, I'm able to eat whole meals with a side of water to help wash it down. 

My happiness is so high due to the fact that I'm feeling more and more like me again not this zonked out zombie!

I still can't believe how many people this post has affected. My intentions were never for it to go ""viral"" I just wanted to tell my story mostly for me, When it was still fresh in my mind. I could express myself and always look back on this moment in life, but now because of everyone's support and love I'll look back on it in ways I could never imagined!",tifu

AITA for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though I don't need it?,"I hate flying to the point that I will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. It's not that I'm scared of flying, I just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

So I only fly if I can buy a second seat (or third if I'm flying with my wife). It lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. Also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class AND for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. I'm a big guy but I 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

On multiple flights I've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no I bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

AITA for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? If I was willing to fly with one seat I wouldn't have bought a second seat.

Note - I do not take two seats on the train/bus EVER. They are way more comfortable and you can stand whenever etc so I don't feel cramped and trapped like on a plane.",AmItheAsshole
"UPDATE 2: I [31M] found out my fiance cheated during her [30F] bachelorette party, planning on leaving","I am making this as I feel I owe it to all of you. The amount of PM's and responses have been incredible. Many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. Both the negative and positive comments have helped me and I would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

Yesterday I was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. The only person I responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. I didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

During the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as I need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). My plans have changed a bit, I am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend I was supposed to go to. I called him up and let him know I want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but I know i will be leaving for somewhere. He said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. We will see how that turns out...

Later in the day I responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since I sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
I picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. I could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. She kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. She I have misunderstood the entire situation... I could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). Anyway I told her to explain it to me right then and there. She said because I only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that I should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. During the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
After she told me its all a misunderstanding I told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
After I hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). It didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. She said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. I was just quiet during most of it. The more I didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

She started telling me I can fuck other women if I want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
I told her fucking other woman was not something I needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
The sister was telling her stuff in the background but I couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

She kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. After that she started saying something but I just hung up. 

For like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. He told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that I always will be welcome to him and that I am a good guy. His wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. She tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. I politely tell her I appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

My ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. She then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
She kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and I didnt say much.

After some time I just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. She starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that I said I would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. I told the sister I only said I think about it, and now that I have I realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. She then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
The only thing I said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". After this I just hung up.

My phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. I dont plan on responding. I honestly feel ALOT better right now, like I can move on. I will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. If someting more happens I will update this post.

Maybe I will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.
Once again big thanks to all of you who supported me here on reddit and gave me so much support.

I dont know when I feel okay to start dating/meeting women again but we will see. Once again thanks to you all and sorry for alot of wrong writings, I am not a native english so hope you can read without issues.

Thanks!

EDIT 1: Thank you to whoever gave me reddit gold I appreciate the support ALOT. I however will not be using this account for anything else except this post or maybe a couple of updates in the future, is it possible to refund it to whoever gave it to me somehow?

I would also like to add my best friend (co-owner of my company) hired someone to take care of the company for us, and also booked a month long vacation for the both of us. I am lucky to have such a good person in my life, and i hope you all are able to find a friend like this (i would do the same for him). Hes been a friend since we were kids and if i lost all other people i know he would be there for me, so big thanks to him!

Also I dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). Aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity I dont mind answering them.

I also think about making an update post in a while, when would you want it (i have had many questions about making future updates). In a month? when i am back from vacation?

Once again thanks for all the support

so it's been 2 weeks since i posted.

i talked to my bf the day after and basically said what everyone else already commented and what i was thinking. no, i didn't secretly record her because that didn't sit right with me. i told him her behavior was making me super uncomfortable and that he needed to set boundaries with her asap, or i wasn't going to put up with it anymore. i was fucking pissed while telling him this and he got the message. he texted her in front of me and even let me read it. i was satisfied and very relieved. felt like i could finally breathe.

best friend came over a few times and was very nice to me. she wasn't being inappropriate even once, very respectful of the boundaries we had set. when we were alone she was the same girl as when we were all together. total 180. great. i was sooo glad and happy. thought she got the hint.

skip to yesterday. boyfriend is in the shower and left his phone in his pants on the floor. phone keeps vibrating and im getting annoyed. i grab his phone, all the messages are from best friend. there are pics of them fucking, a video i didn't watch and a lot of lovey dovey messages. i scrolled back and it went back to at least 2 months ago until i had enough and had an emotional breakdown. serious plans together, honestly i never came even came up in their conversations. he came back from the gym last night. we were going to have sex after he got out of the shower. and he had been fucking here minutes before he came home. 

im staying with a friend for a while. had to take work off today because im a total wreck. honestly im still in shock, i seriously can't comprehend what's going on. haven't responded to any of bfs messages but he knows i know, he hasn't said anything after he realized it i think. well this confirmed for me im not as desirable as i thought, funny how i genuinely believed he chose for me. i cant even start to explain how shit i feel. started drinking but luckily i have my friend here who is taking care of me, bless her.

"AITA - I moved for my husband's job, my kids now hate me","Bit long, stick with me. Throwaway because I'm active on a mom board, and haven't discussed this there.

My ex and I split 5 years ago now. We had a daughter who is 16, a son who is 13 and a daughter who is 5. He's always been a good dad, and we split 50/50 custody, essentially the kids one week my house/one week his house. After my divorce, I reconnected with a high school boyfriend and fell head over heels in love again. He's in the military but hadn't had to move in years. We married 2 years ago. 

A year ago, he got orders to move to Texas from where we all were in California. My older two kids were not happy at all, and didn't want to move, while the baby didn't really express a preference. I approached my ex and told him the situation. I said I know the situation sucks, but we'd foot the bill to him for every trip to him on holidays, breaks, summers, etc. He blew his top and said absolutely not, I wouldn't ""take his kids away"" and said he'd see me in court.

The judge ended up ruling in his favor, and I was awarded summers and every other holiday. I was absolutely devastated. I moved, and I've barely seen the kids since. They came at Christmas for a week, and it was tense the whole time. The older kids, especially my daughter, are short with me on FaceTime, while the baby gets distracted and can't chat much. My daughter has said I chose a man over her, and that she wants nothing to do with me, while my son won't talk about it but I can tell he's angry.

AITA for not wanting to pay for a diamond ring?,"So my girlfriend and I recently got engaged, and I figured it would be nicer to have her pick out her own ring rather then me guessing what she likes. 
Now I already know my girlfriend loves shiny things, but now she is absolutely adamant that she wants a real diamond ring. Personally I don't like the idea of shelling out so much money for a piece of jewelry with an artificial high price. So instead I offered to buy her one that was lab-grown, as it's way cheaper but also doesn't involve shady business practices and labor. 

Money isn't an issue, it's really about the ethics for me. I do not like the idea of buying her something that potentially harmed someone in the making of it for our wedding.

"Incest is Bad, but How did Human... or any other species for that matter have a large enough initial population to ensure diversity?","So, this is kind of getting into Adam and Eve territory but...

We all know how inbreeding can cause a lot of issues such as genetic deformation.  What I couldn't figure out is that how do we have enough of a population to begin with to ensure that genetic deformation is not going to ruin humanity or any other species at the very beginning?

I mean, there's 7 billion of us right now.  But how is that possible given that we didn't have 7 billion combinations to start with?  And also, movies like Snowpiercer or ""Human, Space, Time and Human"" where basically 1 pair of breeding human are left, humanity is essentially boned right?

I mean, the pair can make some offsprings, but there's no escaping inbreeding at some point... and with genetic deformation and all that... humanity will end anyways just with time progression?

(like with Chicken and Egg question... I don't know how much egg or chicken we had to start with, but it can't possibly create diversity from just 2 combinations right?)

\-------------

Edit: 11/2

So I've read most of the replies.  And it seems to me that 2 solid conclusions can be made:

1: Humanity actually is not as diverse genetically as I previously thought.  As someone pointed out at some point, how our entire 7 billion is less genetically diverse than 2 groups of chimps in relatively close proximity.  Since, I don't know how much proto human we have, someone said just a few thousand at the lowest point, but given how it's only been like 20 thousand years since near the end of the last ice age, I don't think there's enough time to stretch true genetic diversity from few thousands to 7 billions.  Hence... how we are all just 30th cousins from one another.

2: So it's possible to continue humanity with just 1 pair of breeding human.  It's just that, along the way, you will lose A LOT of offsprings (some people cited 40% deformities that would get eliminated as humanity build itself backup?)  So it becomes more of a number's game.  You need enough offsprings having enough children to offset the 40% loss.

.....

Extra thought: so in one of the replies, I raised story about Trex Ohio not mating with Trex Mississippi.  Obvious mass extinction did happen.  Maybe in this particular case, genetic diversity extinction wouldn't be valid.  But I think Megalodon extinction due to lack of genetic diversity is more probable, right?  I can't imagine giants like Megalodon being so prevalent as it's the top of the food chain.  So it's entirely possible that with changing climates, food, evolutionary competitions, it simply did not have enough population to offset the 40% loss.  In my mind, 40% is only winnable as a guarantee if you have infinite source.  Like in casinos.  Even if you have 60% chance of winning, there's still a high probability that you will lose everything from a bad beat.  A bank with infinite money is the only guaranteed way to take advantage of 60% win rate.

So... humans with the ability to reproduce every 9 months for up to 4 babies each time has much better odds than megalodons to offset the 40% loss.  Sounds plausible?

\----------

Edit 2:  I knew there are more than 1 breeding human at the very beginning when we were still somewhere in Africa.  The Adam and Eve is more of a metaphor as to how there were such a relatively small amount of initial population compared to what we have now in just a relatively short span of time in evolutionary biology.  It's quite incredible actually.  

The 1 breeding pair scenario is more of a situation that came up during those South Korean movies.  Those Koreans really love their bible references.  (watch the space time human one.  It's so trippy.  Although the ending is so unsatisfying, as the end didn't depict the continuation of the mother and son, thus avoiding making judgement of the Adam and Eve scenario... kind of a cop out.)",NoStupidQuestions

AITA for getting defensive about a birthday gift I gave to a friend?,"For a friend's birthday I got him a budget record player from Amazon along with 10 old vinyls from a second hand shop. He is pretty into music so I thought it would be a cool gift. Plus I'm tight on money to give him anything more expensive.

After I gave him the presents at the birthday party he opened it to test it out. Here enters Pretentious Music Snob (PMS), he starts fiddling with the record player, as soon as my friend opened the package.

PMS: (asking me) How much did you get it for?

Me: 60 dollars.

PMS: (friend's name) be careful of the needle. It's a cheap vinyl player and it might scratch the records.

I thought that was a weird thing to say, considering that he was right in front of me, but I gave him the benefit of the doubt since it might actually be useful advice.

My friend put on a vinyl and it started playing. 

PMS: The speakers sound pretty crap.

Friend: I think it sounds fine.

PMS: You know what you can do? You should take out the speakers from the player and rewire it to better speakers to improve the sound. Here's the setup I have at home. (Pulls out his phone, starts showing him stuff) The one that xxx gave you is like the cheapest record player you can buy so it's not going to give you a good sound.

At this point I was pretty annoyed. He might be right, but I think it's a dick move to straight up say that my gift crap when I was right next to him. So I decided to call him out.

Me: Hey look, if you think that my gift is trash, why didn't you get him something better yourself instead of a 20 dollar gift card? (Yes, he got him a 20 dollar gift card for my friend's 18th)

The room became silent and it got pretty awkward. I know that it's the thought that counts and it's bad to compare the value of the presents that you give, me calling PMS out about the value of his gift might be shallow and petty, but I reckon that he deserves it for talking shit about my gift right in front of me.

So AITA?

Edit: I posted this before going to bed (I live in Australia) and woke up in the morning expecting like 50 comments but Holy Crap this blew up. Here's some additional info:

When birthday friend opened the present, everyone gathered around and was watching because we're (mostly) 18 year old who have never seen a record player at work before. So when PMS was pointing out the flaws in my gift, it was to everyone at the party since all the attention was on the record player, and thus him at that moment. 

To be honest I'm not a confrontational person and I wouldn't have said anything until the point where he pulled out his phone and showed birthday friend what he thought would be better gifts, that was the last straw for me. I said what I said to A) shut him up, I wasn't in the mood for listening to him saying how bad my gift was for 10 more minutes B) Yes I said it in a way that embarrassed him. I'm not a saint, I didn't take the high road, but I sure as hell feel good about standing up for myself. 

When I said the room went silent and awkward, it was like for 10 second. I've apologised to birthday friend over text for making a scene, he said to not worry about since PMS was also annoying him. 

I posted this to see if my response was appropriate and that I didn't over escalate it. My conclusion is that sometimes you gotta be an asshole yourself to stand up to a bully and I don't regret what I did.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by not wearing a bra,"Today was a lounging, do-nothing day. I (22) watched some Netflix in the living room while my brother (24) played games in his room and my older brother (27) had work. The evening came, my brother came home from work and went to talk with my other brother in his room. 

My mom called to ask what ingredients we had around the house so she can pick up stuff for dinner. An hour later she called to let me know she'll be home soon and my brothers and I have to dispute who has to help her bring groceries in. 

I went to my brothers, ""Hey, you two have to pick which one of you have to help mom bring groceries in. She'll be home in 5 minutes."" I walked away like I was so clever, not including myself as an option. 

""Why doesn't she help?"" I hear one say to the other. ""I dunno,"" the other says. 

A few minutes pass and the two of them came out of the room and approached me on the couch. 
""You grab the arms, I'll grab the legs?"" 
""Yup.""

My older brother grabbed my ankles and the other my arms. I made it a little difficult though, I stiffened (which is probably easier) and I crossed my arms holding my elbows close to my torso so he didnt have anywhere to hold except a poor grip on my shoulders. 

Being the weak noodle I am, I couldn't hold my arms in long enough. He grabbed my upper arms and they carried me toward the stairs to the front door. I half expected they wouldn't bring me outside, but I knew they would go all the way even when I had no jacket or shoes.

I didnt want to be carried awkwardly down the stairs so as we got closer, I struggled. I kicked my legs with little effort because I didnt want to hurt anyone, and since that didnt really work I had an idea. Risky. I lifted my arms straight up so my brothers hands would lose grip an drop me. 

I dropped slowly since he was still trying to hold me with my arms up (I was wearing a long sleeve bunched at my elbows) but as I hit the floor I realized my shirt had lifted. My sleeves must have been pulled off my arms, lifting the rest.

It was over. My ankles were released. 

I put my now freed hands down over my chest and feel my nipple. Yup. The brother by my feet definitely saw. I noticed he was looking away at the moment, but I was sure he saw when it happened. 

Thankfully I am small chested, so I'm not as embarrassed as someone else would be. 
But it is still awkward to think about.

P.S. Sorry bro....

"LPT: College isn't the only way to start a good career. Apprenticeships, Trade Schools, and Military Training can be great alternatives in today's world.","The price of four-year universities in the US, among other countries, is huge and growing. There are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. Obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

If, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**To high school juniors and seniors:** 

Your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. If you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. [Here](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**Why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

These jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. As that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. According to [this article](http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. Anecdotally, I work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**Is there any money in it?**

There definitely can be. Unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. That doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. Assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. I'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until [_ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt] later. 

That's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. There are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. Moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. You're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**What are my options?**

There are a ton of ways to start a career, but I'll talk about a few.

**Apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. Apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. Once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

A recent [report](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from NPR took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in Germany's industrial success. The US government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. The federal program is [here](https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest [American Job Center](https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

The federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. In a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. One example would be the [IBEW](http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so I won't bother trying to list a bunch. Searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**Trade Schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. Many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. There are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. It isn't for everyone as I understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but I know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

Training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. A computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**Military** training can also be a great economic ladder. The pay and benefits are good from the start. Depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). Plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. There are some huge risks associated with this route though, so I would reserve it as a last resort. 

Regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. That is not the only income, though. In most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. That's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. Even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. Another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. On the outside, that would cost a lot.

Regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. Some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. You could also be a bus driver. You don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. I would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

Regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. I really enjoyed most of the time I spent in the military. There were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. The good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. The bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

I know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. In reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**TL;DR**

If you want to get smart, go to college. If you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**Edit:** Based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. As a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. Enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the AF lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""No thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

Also about the military, I offered it up as a last resort, and I mean that. Plenty of commentators are saying ""DON'T EVER THINK ABOUT JOINING THE MILITARY FOR TRAINING!"" I don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. You would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. If you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

Regarding ROTC, it is better than nothing. I intentionally didn't mention it though. My philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing ROTC vs my immediate family and I enlisting. If you do ROTC, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. After 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. If you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the AF, can't say how easy it is in the others. So you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. From a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. Additionally, I had a way better time than ANY officer I know, and I didn't even like the military. The lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. I wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

Still relevant to ROTC, but about school in general... A ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. I'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""Go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful LPT. You have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",LifeProTips

"UPDATE: My father and step mother died, leaving me (19m) and my step sister (8f). My step sisters father, won't allow me visitations... I GOT CUSTODY!!!","**EDIT: per the bots request, I am required to tell you that I live in Washington (WA)**

[Here's my original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b3rfty/wa_my_father_and_step_mother_died_leaving_me_19m/)

So after one of the most stressful months of my life, I can happily tell you all that I got custody of my step sister.

I did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people I've ever met in my life. I told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

After my step sisters bio dad was informed that I would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. The lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. She said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

After her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, I then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. I've never signed so many things in my entire life. Because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, I was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

Her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

Yesterday, I signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that I had 100% custody of my step sister. After I signed, we both cried and cried for hours. We're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. As I write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

The past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. I consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision I've ever made. These events have made me realise that family isn't just DNA based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

Thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. I owe all of you for the rest of your lives. Once I turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the Aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

I hope you all lead wonderful lives. Give your loved ones a big hug for me.",legaladvice
"My sister caused a scene at Mother's Day brunch because we didn't honor her as a ""cat mom""","Hi guys. I am a man, 32M and I have two sisters - Carly (38F) and Melinda (26F). We went out to a family style restaurant for brunch and just returned home.

Melinda and I are happily married, each with three children. My older sister Carly never married. She had a fianc√© that she cheated on and he left her. That was 10 years ago and she hasn't been in a relationships longer a few months ever since. She has 4 indoor cats and also feeds a few stray cats that hand around her neighborhood.

My mom was very ecstatic because in the last year, my younger sister and I both gave her an additional grandchild. So she gave a speech.

In her speech, she thanked us all for coming and said some flowery lovey stuff and then thanked Melinda and my wife for both being excellent mothers to her beautiful grandchildren.

Upon hearing my mom praise my wife and my younger sister for being mothers, my sister Carly butt in rudely with a loud and irked ""Achem!""

She then went on a diatribe about how she is a mom just like they are, and why don't we ever wish her a happy Mother's Day?

I explained calmly that she isn't a mom at which point, she threw a fork at me and raised her voice in the restaurant ""I am a f*cking mom too you d*mn a**holes! Just because I don't have human babies doesn't mean I'm not a f*cling mother too!""

My younger sister tried to calm her down but instead, Carly just poured her third glass of white wine into a nearby potted plant, spit at the plant (wtf I know right) and then stormed out.

We thought that we be the end of it, but now she has published a manifesto on her social media calling us small minded and disrespectful and went on to explain why she feels that she is a mother. Despite never getting pregnant and giving birth.

We have family and friends calling us on the phone since, asking what happened. I don't know what to tell them other than maybe my sister is showing signs of a nervous breakdown?

I tried texting Carly to say ""hi"", but my text came back green (which she has an iPhone so it's usually blue). Does this mean she blocked me?

Anyways I would appreciate any help y'all could give here :/",relationship_advice
"I (M26) just got cheated on/dumped by girlfriend (F23). Have chance for revenge, should I take it?","Some quick context. My GF of 2 years had to drop out of uni last October due to money issues. I helped her move to my city to start fresh. After a few months of living separately and saving, we moved into an apartment together and she got an awesome job offer. Things were looking great. 

Her new job requires her to attend a 3 month training course on a campus in a different part of the country. She's 2 weeks into this course and she's just told me that she's ending our relationship because she's started fucking another trainee. This means I now have to move out of our apartment because I can't afford to live here by myself (whereas she can). 

So I've lost my girlfriend and my apartment and naturally I'm pretty pissed. However I know that the training course she is on has a strict 'no relationship' policy amongst trainees, and is punishable by exclusion from the course. I'm contemplating sending an email to the company explaining the situation. I don't have any proof but I'm sure if they monitored her she would get caught out soon enough and sent home. 

I don't know whether or not to do it. I feel like she has just ruined my life, and as much as I'd like to walk away from this situation, part of me wants to get some payback. 

What do you guys think? Dick move or karma?

UPDATE: You're all as indecisive as I am.  I'm going day drinking with my Dad and will likely discuss this at length. Will update later with my decision for anyone who gives a shit. (Thanks to those who have left kind words, I appreciate it. The aggressive comments have made me laugh too so cheers.)

UPDATE 2: A lot of you guys asked for an update so here it is. Despite a lot of convincing posts, I'm not going to do it. She needed a lot of support to get to this point (financial, emotional and otherwise) and without it I think she's perfectly capable of fucking up this opportunity by herself. I'm going to keep the apartment, even if it means I have to leave down the line. I want to put her through the stress of finding somewhere new to live whilst out of the city. 

Thanks for all the kind messages (and the edgy ones). A lot of you guys are wise as fuck and gave some good advice. Sorry to everyone that wanted revenge, perfectly ready for you guys to call me boring or a pussy or whatever.

TIFU by quoting a kid's movie at the end of sex.,"This happened around 5 years ago when I was still in university. 

I was not the most forthcoming 5 years ago, I didn't know how to 'be' around women, let alone, god forbid, have sex with said women. 

As surprising as it may seem then, I was going through quite the 'dry spell' that year, and had resigned myself to studying instead and little else. 

However, as with all things in life, the moment you stop you looking is the moment you find it. 

I found myself back at this girl's house who was studying in the UK for that year. She was from Slovenia (somewhat unimportant detail other than those Brits who voted 'Leave' and now see me as part of the EU problem somehow) and absolutely gorgeous. I was punching way, way above my weight and thought I should relish every one of the seconds I knew I was going to enjoy with this girl. 

Again, unsurprisingly, I did not quite go the distance. I was however, in a state of absolute delirium - that post-orgasm 'fuzz' where everything in the world seems grand, and nothing could take that away.

Apart from me, of course. 

She, rightly so, tried to, y'know, get me going again, for my first attempt was so poor. 

However, in my state of delirium, and ultimately recovery, I was in no fit state to do so just yet. 

As she goes to sit atop of me, my brain goes into a strange autopilot. 

I gently push her to the side to stop her sitting down on me. Ok, that's bad enough, but it didn't stop there.

I, for entirely unknown reasons say the words 'That'll do pig, that'll do'. In exactly the same way as that immortal final line from the kid's movie called 'Babe' (about a pig, funnily enough). 

As it transpires, this movie was not a hit in Slovenia, and no amount of me pleading 'IT'S A KID'S MOVIE' at her seemed to help as she slowly got dressed and opened the door for me. 

TLDR: Ended a dry spell with a knockout girl, refused round two by calling her a farmyard animal.

Edit 1 - thanks for the Gold. You've taken my gold virginity, in fact. That'll do, pig, that'll do. 

Edit 2 - to all those all knowing sex gods on Reddit telling me that sex doesn't end at the male orgasm. Yeah, thanks guys, I know. I was in a state of bewilderment. I just needed a moment. I had plans. But then I fucked up. Hence why it's here on TIFU. Who woulda thought it or thunk it?",tifu
"If your child is not able to understand and obey the 'no talking in the cinema' rule, your child is not old enough to go to the cinema.","Kids films aside, if your child feeds the need to shout out the name of every character, give a running commentary on what is happening, and ask questions every five seconds, please do not take them to the cinema with other human beings for whom this may be a rare and special treat.

Edited to add: well I went to sleep and this blew up. Three things:

1) my issue is not with how the kids behave - they are too young to know better. Their entitled ass parents however, should know better. 


2) I'm in the UK, this was not a matinee showing. Even if it was, I refuse to believe that it is ok to bring your young child to a movie they cannot understand, follow, sit still or be quiet for.

My nutjob neighbour is attempting to frame me twice in 7 days and I am concerned about what she might be cooking up next.,"Ontario, Canada

The police have visited my house twice in the past 7 days to accuse me of crimes against this crazy woman across the street that are all fabricated from her imagination.

The first day I was woken out of bed at 11:15 PM to be accused of hiding in the ditch with camouflage and a camera trying to get photos of her at home, and shining bright lights and laser beams in the direction of her home and flashing lights inside my own house.    I told them that none of that ever happened and they don't believe me.

Only 7 days later the police returned with all new accusations.   Someone has stolen a chainsaw from one of my close neighbours and for some reason I am suspect number one.    They didn't tell me whos shed it was but I did see the police back at crazy ladies house two days ago, so I am fairly sure I am truly being targeted.

I feel the police give her undue credibility because she is very wealthy and I am very poor.",legaladvice

AITA for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house?,"So, my husband has this friend, I'll call him Alex. Alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. Alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. The rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. If you tell him Alex, I want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""You just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

Anyway, one day, my husband had Alex and another friend over, Joe. They were working on a project out in the garage together. I was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. I have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40¬∞F outside so she couldn't go out there with them. Luckily I had my best friend over to help, but still. So while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. NBD. When the pup finally goes to sleep, Alex came inside to get something. I told him ""Your dog is asleep. Don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" And what does he do? Comes over to pet her and mess with her. So I told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because I wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when I wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

Anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until I couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. I walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""It's so loud that we can't hear the TV"". 

Alex responded with ""Well turn up your TV then."" I had a moment where I was too shocked to speak. So I unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

Apparently after I left, he started talking about how annoying I was *to my husband* and that he thought I acted bitchy. My husband told me all of this later that night in bed and I asked what he said to Alex. ""Nothing, really"" I got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. We had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

The next day, I told my husband that Alex was no longer welcome in our home. My husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so I compromised with ""Alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

TIFU While talking dirty to my gf,"Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So a little background: My current gf and I have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. Before her I was a virgin, she's slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. Obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we're still learning about what the other likes sexually, and I'm learning everything for the first time. Long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. I said I was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside I knew that I had no idea what I would be doing and would kind of be winging it. Last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. So we're getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we're wasted so it's fine. She's telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.
She kind of rambled for a bit, and I was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she'd run out of material soon. The rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than I normally do. This is all new territory for me, but I'm feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like Christopher Columbus, and she's what I think is India. So I decide to talk dirty. Her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, I figure this is the perfect time to strike. And that's when I cleverly decided to ask if I make her ""moister than an oyster"". 

Her face fell. It's hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. I went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. I've been wondering how I could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. We approach this next weekend, and we've talked twice since then. I don't think I'll be redeeming myself anytime soon. 

TLDR: I decided to be sexy and asked my gf if I made her moister than an oyster. She doesn't think oysters are sexy.",tifu
AITA for forcing my son to see how difficult it is to raise a baby?,"My son sat me and his mother down last week and told us he had gotten his girlfriend pregnant. He is only 17 and she is 16. I told him I was proud that he came forward to tell me, but I didn't get too far into the discussion before he told me that they are keeping the baby. Both have not graduated high school, and frankly, both are quite irresponsible. According to him, having a child is ""easy"" and not ""really that hard"". We tried to persuade him to look at other options, but he was adamant that they were going to have the kid and that was the end of that.

Since then, the house has been quite tense. Any talk of the situation is immediately shut-down and my son refuses to see what we are attempting to show him. I have decided to teach him that kids are more difficult then he initially thinks. Since my son told us they were pregnant, I have done the following:

1. I wake him up twice a night, 2 hours apart after he has fallen asleep. I open the door, scream as loud as I can until I know he is awake, and I shut the door. I've done this 5 nights in a row.
2. I purchased a sack of flour for him and dressed it in a diaper. I have made him change the diaper every 2 hours, and if he doesn't, I shut off the internet until he changes it. I will sometimes smear nutella in the diaper for added effect/mess.
3. While playing one of his games, I told him his ""baby"" wanted to be held. Giving me a truly shit-eating grin, he told me he has no issue playing his game and holding the baby. I placed the sack of flour in his arms and he continued to play basically one handed. While he was doing this, I went to the kitchen, grabbed a small cup of applesauce and splashed it on his shoulder while he was playing. I told him that his baby spit up and he might want to pause his game to take care of that.
4. I have not allowed him to go to the movies or hang out with his friends at their house. When he presses me for a reason, I tell him ""You dont have a babysitter. You can go if you take your sack of flour with you."" He has not gone anywhere in a week.
5. Yesterday, I did my best pratfall in front of his friends who were over and then wailed and cried until he came over and started talking to me. I told him babies demand attention, and he will have to get used to this. This was the last straw for him.

After his friends left, he accused me of being an asshole and for being ridiculous with the wants and needs of a baby. He told me I am being completely unrealistic. I reminded him that he himself was an incredibly fussy baby, and everything I have done so far he has done to me in the past.

His mother tells me I am being an asshole and to let him make his own decisions, but I don't want my 17 year shackled to a baby when neither of them are ready for this. If anything, I want him to realize how hard this is going to be, and to at least look at options.

What is the best way to tell my homophobic foster family that I am not a single hetero gay man but a married gay man with a kid?,"Gotta do my yearly ditties and visit them this summer. Usually I just show up for a few hours and be hetero and leave.

But they want to know why I haven't settle down and married a nice lady and had a few kids. 

Truth is, I been married to a man for the last 6 years. We have a kid together and a life together.

And they are against gay marriage and interracial marriage. I'm Italian and my husband is super duper white. And they assume they are entitled to my life despite only being my foster parents for the last few years before my 18th birthday. Narrsistic people. Rude. Religious. 

Shout out to rasiedbynarrsitc and entitledparents subbreddit by the way.

Also these are the same people that firmly believe my gay was a phase. They sent my a gay-away camp. I ended up getting caned and two of my ribs are no longer attached to my rib cage due to the canning. They believe that the canning helped cure me and so it was a just beating. 

Btw I lived in America during this time, so please vote every November to end conversion camps.

So yeah. Seeing them mid July. What is the best way to tell them that I am still gay, happily married, and a proud dad?

My (28F) family (18-88) missed my little brother's (18M) graduation. How can they make it up to him?,"He's upset. He cried. He went to everyone of his cousin's and siblings graduation and none of them came for his. Our mom missed it for work. Our grandma missed it because she had a doctor's appointment(completely understandable). Uncle and aunt missed it because they didn't think he would care. Cousins had work. Siblings missed it because they thought they could waltz right in at the end because his name was one of the last ones called in a student body of 900. But the ushers wouldn't let anyone in after a certain time. They were a hour late. It was just me and a cousin. I cried and cheered when he walked. My baby brother graduated today and he's miserable. 

I am worried about him. My family is blaming the school and each other right now. Im disappointed in everyone else. They're trying to force him to hang out with them to make up for it, but of course nothing will make it up to him. What can I or they do/say to help him feel better?

EDIT : Thank you for all the advice. I guess I didn't have to worry too much. He needed time alone to think it over in his room. He's definitely stronger than me and more mature. He said he hated feeling sad, so he stopped. Also said he understood that everyone had other things to do. Hopefully his next graduation is a lot better. Maybe I'll post an update in 4 years.

My [33M] fianc√©e [27F] chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. How can I ever repay her?,"Two nights ago, my fianc√©e accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. The fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. I wasn't home, so I wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. If I was, I would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. It's just stuff. 

She chose differently. First, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. Then she went back in. At this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. She knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

Both of us have lost parents. I lost my dad 3 years ago. He was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before I actually met her. I have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom I have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. She lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

Instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

I don't even know how to begin to say thank you. I'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and I can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. I don't know how to repay her. Or where to begin. Can anybody think of a nice gesture I can make it up to her? She must be devastated. I can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad.

"Wife died unexpectedly, discovered her affair","My wife died this past week unexpectedly. She was young and healthy, and the illness took her in hours. I thought things had hit rock bottom. She essentially died in front of me, and I was wracked by grief and guilt over her death. 

All things considered, I was coping as well as could be expected. Make no mistake, I was going through the expected grieving reactions. I raged and hysterically cried for days. I went numb and then silent, then hysterical again. But I have good friends and I have been surrounded by family from both sides of the marriage. 

In the process of going through her belongings I discovered on her phone that she had been having an on and off affair for the last three years. It looks like she started cheating during a period where I was depressed after losing my job and father in the space of two weeks, both unexpectedly. After mourning for three months and seeking treatment for diagnosed depression, I was back at a new job. However, at the time she said that she felt lonely and that I was distant to her. In the following years we worked to try and mend our relationship but she would always come back to saying that things changed those months after my father's death. 

What more can life do to me? This man she was having the affair with appears to be an asshole that may have been abusing her, based on the text messages. He appears to be the exact opposite of me. I am a kind, generous, attractive, and intelligent person with a good career. The logical part of my brain knew that she had the capacity for dishonesty and selfishness, but I could never have imagined this. 

I am absolutely and totally devastated. The only saving grace is that we never had children. I wanted them and she did too, but she kept wanting to put it off. I suppose now I know the truth of why. 

I feel like I will never be happy again. ",relationship_advice
"[UPDATE] [Texas] My Mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. However, the police is still alive, and when I showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. How can I get my cat back?","Link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

Hello,

First off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. I didn't feel like advice to steal my cat back was 'legal' (thus, being in this subreddit), so I took one users advice to talk to the director of Animal Control in my mom's city.

She basically told me that the police have no idea what they're doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. She said that the only thing I can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as 'stolen property'. She said the police will understand what to do if a I reference my cat as 'property' and not an animal.

I went to the police station and the police threw me around again. Despite I tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn't 'property'. After 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom's texts. 

The cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, I can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my 'stolen property'.

We get to my mom's house and she's not there. We look around the outside of her house and find no signs of Kitty either. I call her and ask her where she is, and told her that I was at her house with the police. She said, in quote, ""I took the cat and ran off into Oklahoma and I'm not ever coming back."" 

The police said they can't help me since they don't have jurisdiction in Oklahoma. 

I went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so I left because I can't afford it. On my way home, I contacted Adult Protective Services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. So I hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

I also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into Oklahoma. My mom played the 'poor me' card, so my family bought into it. And somehow, I'm now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... When I got home, I cut everyone out. All of my family. I separated every single tie I had to them.

I've had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if I'm being open about the situation, I was a victim of childhood abuse. That cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me I won't be able to get him back. I ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now I'm getting help for my own mental health. This situation broke me, and right now, I'm trying to recover.

Thank you everyone for listening. 

**Tl;dr:** My cat is gone and I'll never get him back.",legaladvice

AITA For telling my brother-in-law that he ruined me and my husband's wedding night?,"A bit of backstory, my husband's brother (we'll call him Tony) is the youngest in their sibling trio. Tony is 29 and got married about 3 years ago. When Tony married his wife, before my now husband and I met, my husband (Larry) did a little ""prank"" on Tony's wedding night. Larry got some of that washable car window paint and wrote ""just married"" on the back and put balloons under a tarp in the bed of the trunk to be lifted. Larry also placed a few boxes of condoms in the truck to be funny. I've seen pictures of this myself, if I can find them, I will attach them in an edit. 

Flash forward to my husband and I's wedding night, as we were returning to my husbands truck, we noticed Tony did a ""prank"" of his own. He covered my husbands truck in pink washable paint, put personal lubricant all over the outside and stuck feminine hygiene products all over it. He also threw condoms out of the package inside the truck, threw glitter on both the inside and the outside of the truck, and confetti. 

My husband and I were outraged, we saw this as going too far and also made my 11 year old daughter very uncomfortable. Tony didn't see the problem and neither did the family, they all thought it was hilarious. We drove the truck back to the hotel and spent hours cleaning the inside. 

While we were cleaning, I called Tony and very calmly explained to him that he upset Larry and I and that we had to spend hours cleaning it. I also explained that the wash on the outside of the truck wasn't going to be cheap, to which Tony said, ""use the money I gave you guys for your wedding present for that then."" Which angered me more and I hung up on him. I did not cuss at him nor did I yell. 

After we spent nearly $50 cleaning the exterior of the truck, I got a very nasty call from Tony in which he called me a b*tch, couldn't take a joke, and worst of all, felt bad for my daughter that i had an uptight woman like me as her mother. I didn't say anything back, I just hung up. 

The next day, I wake up to texts from his family saying that I was too harsh on Tony, that Tony drove 7hrs for our wedding, and he was just ""getting Larry back"" for what happened at his wedding. Larry told me that he actually deleted texts that Tony sent me over night because he was ""embarrassed by what his brother said."" 

I refuse to talk to Tony and so does my husband until we get an apology for what he did and said. I apologized to Tony for perhaps being too harsh, which I admit, wasn't a genuine apology. But, I expected an apology back. Instead I got more ""poor me"" from Tony. Larry &amp;amp; Tony's parents texted me saying I need to ""stop creating drama"" and step back and think about how this makes Tony feel. But, I think my ignoring Tony is valid as what he said before was very hurtful. 

I've been called an asshole by Tony himself. And i'm wondering if there's something here that I'm missing

AITA?


**UPDATE: Brother-in-law posted to Facebook with a totally false story**

[and here's what he posted](https://m.imgur.com/a/t6qGLj8) 

So, I thought there were two photos according to my mother posted on Facebook but it's just this one. That only shows the front of the truck before the vaseline/pink paint/rest of the sanitary products were added. Brother-in-law posted that ""I [Tony] welcomed OP to the family with open arms and she cussed me out then insulted me!""

Yeah, *I'm sorry, what?* I did **not** cuss him out nor did I insult him as my young daughter was around. He also added, ""OP should get over herself as it wasn't even that bad."" Yeah, good job cherry picking what you wanted everyone to see. Only his wife, their sister, and their father saw the actual final product with us when we did. Everyone else in the family, this is all their seeing and they now have the perspective that I cussed out *poor Tony*. 

I asked Larry what the deleted messages said and Larry told me the gist of it was, ""OP and her daughter will never really be apart of this family."" And Larry said thats the less insulting way to put it. 

I'm sorry if this seems rude but I am very upset as Tony just threw more gasoline at an already ignited flame. Larry said that he's going to take care of it from here and that if I get involved more, Tony is just going to make more lies up. 

Anyway, I appreciate everyone's replies! A lot were very helpful, Larry and I are definitely going to apply some of the advice given. I'm still refusing to speak to Tony until he apologizes to what he said about myself and my daughter including embarrassing her when a condom fell on her in the truck. Hopefully things work out soon! I don't want to start off my entrance to this family badly, either. Thanks again!

Edit: You can see one of the condoms in the truck actually and some of the streamers and glitter. It might not be high-res, sorry. There is two tampons and a pad visible in the photo.

Edit 2: I'm sorry, I did not take any photos of the final product of the truck, I should've. I was still pretty fuming from everything else though, I didnt really think of it. I'm going to ask Larry if he has any screenshots of the texts.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for choosing my biological child over my foster son?,"My husband and I never thought that we could get pregnant, so we got plenty of therapy after a few failed treatments and moved to fostering with the intent to adopt. We've had a few fosters, but this concerns our current foster, a 9 year old who's been with us for two years. He's a spirited boy, but not a bad kid. Just takes a lot of time, money, and mental energy. 

The child's case plan has now moved to adoption, and we were identified as an adoptive resource. We were taking the first steps towards adoption when we found out that I was pregnant. It was mind-blowing as this is my first pregnancy, and I am now over 40. I had thought I had finally hit menopause, but was in fact 12 weeks pregnant. 

Unfortunately, after thinking we could do both, we did the hard math, and with our work and our finances, the only way we could raise our foster son is if we terminate this pregnancy. We can't financially have both children. I can't emotionally bring myself to terminate what is realistically our only chance at a biological child, who I am already bonding with. My husband wouldn't think of it either. We have to refuse the adoption. 

Unfortunately still, our foster son knows of preparations for an adoption through his therapist and social worker, so now we're taking him away from a stable home and what may be his only chance of adoption as he is older, all for reasons that aren't his fault. Am I the asshole for putting a still unborn child above him?

Edit: 

Baby:
Baby has passed prenatal testing with flying colors.

Finances:

We currently live in a 2 bedroom condo. We are required to give foster son his own room, which is not possible with a baby by social services standards. Us moving into the living room doesn't pass either. Social services is giving us until January to find a larger place, but we would have to stay in the county. We can't afford 3 bedroom places in the county, as it's a costly area.

We don't qualify for assistance with both of us working, and if one of us quits, we wouldn't be able to afford our current place even with the assistance we could get. Both of us working would make it difficult to swing appointments for two children as well. It's a catch 22 basically.",AmItheAsshole

"Cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing","I had purchased a used Cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic I knew. He said his son was driving it. When I first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of BHO oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. I threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
Flash forward to the other night and I was pulled over for an improper lane change. Officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when I was being pulled over. He asked to search the vehicle and which point I said no. Waited half an hour for the dog to show up. He alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  He checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. After his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. They cut into the leather seats. They also cut into my spare tire. Mind you, I have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. They cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. I'm obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. After this well over 2 hour ordeal, I was told I was free to go. When asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. Before I do that I would like to know if there's any better options and how I should pursue this. The seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there's so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what I probably would've payed for it. Not to mention they also ruined my spare. Thank you.

My wife f(31) sent me m(30) a snap chat with a filter that had her in mascara and dark lipstick.,"Her text on the snap was a sarcastic ""Pretty lol"" but to be quite honest she was drop dead gorgeous.  

  

Now on the surface that sounds wholesome and there doesnt seem to be anything that advice is needed for right?  

  

Well my wife almost never wears makeup. No powder, no mascara, not even eye liner or lipstick.  Pretty much the only thing that goes on her face is chapstick.  

  

She has all of these things and will put on eye liner on our ""date nights"" or a fancy get together but that is pretty much it.   

  

We have been happily married for going on 7 years and I have never had a problem with no makeup. She is as beautiful to me today as ever.  

  

But that snap she sent just did something for me. I dont know if it was the dark lipstick (I was a goth kid in highschool), or if it was just makeup in general but fuck if she didnt look the hottest I have ever seen her minus our wedding night.  

  

So the thing I need advice for: How do I tell her this? Do I tell her this? If I tell her this how can I do it in a way that doesnt scream I am an asshole that thinks she is only pretty cause she put make up on?   

  

I want to see her in make up like full on like the snap. Not all day everyday. maybe just like on our datenights. Or even just once a year.

My boyfriend has a crush on my best friend.,"Okay, guys, I don't even know where to start this whole day has been a whirlwind. I apologize as this is going to be a long one. Obligatory apology for formatting as I'm on mobile. 

Last night my on/off boyfriend came (uninvited) to the bar I was at with my friends. He was clearly coked out and half-in-the-bag. The first thing he said to me was ""let me know if anyone here touches you, I'm in a fighting mood."" ?! What. I'm just trying to have a good night with my friends, why did he feel the need to show up here? 

A couple hours later, after many alcoholic beverages, me and my best friend decided to go over to his house with his friends for a night cap. Stupid, I know. We ended up staying all night, I stayed over because I left my house keys in our DDs car and my friend, I'll call her Emilia, left late in the morning. 

In that time, him and Emilia had had ""life chats"" and he had spent most of his time ignoring me to talk to her. At one point when we were both washing our faces to take off the days' makeup, he told her she had perfect skin and it didn't even look like she took anything off, looked at me in the mirror, then followed her back into his room. I have struggled with acne for almost ten years. I'm twenty now. He knows I'm insecure about my skin. 

Anyways. After everyone else had gone home, I was left to take care of his drunk ass for hours until I finally just went out to the living room and fell asleep on the couch. I was rudely awakened moments later to him yelling on the phone, I asked him not once, twice, but three times to please talk in his room. He hung up and yelled at me saying I was keeping him from talking to his dad. ?! 

I got up and went back into his room and fell asleep. This time he woke me up telling me he needed to say something. ""Look at me, *look* at me!"" Then he tells me that he has a crush on Emilia, keep in mind this is their first time ever hanging out, and that she is the only person who's ever listened to him or connected with him in that way. 

I can't stress enough how much I have done for this dude. We have been on and off for **THREE** years. I have stayed up all night with him during his coke binges and supported him through trying to get clean, listened to his endless rants, gave him a place to stay when he didn't have one, driven him to and from work for months when he didn't have a running vehicle, used my CAA when his vehicles have broken down, picked him up in the middle of the night..... the list goes on and on. But I apparently have never listened to him or connected with him like Emilia has. 

Earlier this evening she texted me saying she hadn't even opened his [message](https://imgur.com/a/zKlRFTU), I didn't even know he had messaged her. I honestly don't even know what to say about it, I'm kind of just baffled that three years of being together and all the time I've spent taking care of him has been all for not. That he can just throw it all away because he has a drunk crush on my *best* friend. 

Here is the part where I ask you, dear redditors, for advice. What do I do? I've already broken up with him, blocked him on everything (then unblocked to tell him to get off my netflix), me and Emilia will remain friends of course but, how do I cope with the fact that the person I thought would always have my back, dropped me for her? How do I keep myself from resenting her for it? She is one of my favourite people in this world, I know that this is 100% not her fault, I just don't want my emotions to take a toll on our friendship. Lastly, what is the best way to move on? Please share any stories you think would help or make me feel better. 

If you actually read this whole rant, thank you so, so kindly.

Edit: He was not an addict when we started dating, the coke habit he picked up afterwards. I just didn't want to see him choose that path for himself and thought that I could help him, which I know now is beyond me.

Edit 2: Holy smokes. Thank you guys so much for taking the time to read this and share your thoughts. I'm so sorry I can't reply to you all but I promise I am listening and share many of your opinions. I appreciate everything you have to say whether it is tough-love or no-love. 

To clarify some things: I dumped him! I am NOT mad at Emilia, was just looking for advice so that I don't shift blame. We WERE dating when this happened and that is why I went to his house, when we were off we were VLC. Emilia and I became friends last year through work and have lived in different cities the entirety of our friendship which is why they'd never hung out.

TIFU by showing my grandmom that she had been living a lie for almost 30 years.,"This did happen today. My grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. She doesn't eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. One of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. She says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. So she keeps changing the position of my bed when I am away for work. When I come back, I reposition it my way so that I don't get sunlight on my face early morning. 
Today, she was repositioning the room while I was there which annoyed me. So I took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that I was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. Infact I was pointing east . I instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. And she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. I pointed it out to her. I thought she would take it lightly. Oh man I was wrong. I fucked up biig time. She lost herself. She started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. I am looking at her old compass right now and I can say it doesn't seem right at all. I think I will have to fix this issue today itself. She is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn't great. How stupid am I. 

TL;DR : I fucked up by showing my grandmother that she was sleeping with her bed pointing north which she is strictly against cause of her superstitious beliefs. She did not take it well . 

Edit 1: a lot of you are asking me how she moves furniture at the age of 90. Well she doesnt do it herself, she has a helper who is supposed to take care of her personally but my grandmother doesn't like the idea of employing someone particularly for her so she gives her household chores to keep her busy.
Edit 2: yes the caregiver gets paid extra for this. We tell her not to do the chores  and I assure you it's not that regular. ",tifu
"Why does in boomer's humour, the husband always hate his wife?","After looking for the first time r/boomerhumour, I can't help but notice a redondance in the humour, mostly about :

- The husband always wants sex but the wife never ¬´¬†give it to him¬†¬ª

- The husband is really happy when the wife's away

- The husband doesn't like how the wife looks like (too fat, too old...)

AITA for telling a girl at the gym that her pants are see through?,"My gym has multiple squat racks facing mirrors opposite each other. This means that while your in the rack looking in the mirror, over your shoulder on either side is other people facing away from you in their own rack.  Because it might help with context I'm 6', 170lbs (so not some giant bodybuilder) and the girl in this story is average height and weight as well (not some fitness model but not substantially overweight either).  

While in between sets, I'm standing with my arms on the bar and generally feeling like shit after my first few heavy sets when I see a girl behind me in the mirror at the bottom of her squat and immediately notice that I can clearly see her ass through her pants. 

Like 90% of people in the gym I just want to be left alone, ignore everyone, and pretend the world doesn't exist.  So I move on with life and do another set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and I can pretty much see her butthole.  I don't mean if I squint and stare, I mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants. 

No idea why I cared (am married and completely uninterested) but I go into helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only the two of us can hear say this:

""Hey this is super creepy, but I'd feel creepier if I didn't say something.  When you squat, your pants stretch and go completely see through on your ass.""

Again I thought I was being helpful and that she'd want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that way. This girl practically screams ""You fucking pervert! Stop staring at my ass!"" 

Not needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring at me, I go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and go home.  

I tell my wife about it who laughs and says I was totally an asshole for saying that and she'd be pissed and super embarrassed if someone did that to her. So reddit, settle this, AITA?",AmItheAsshole

AITA for not telling my wife that I picked her daughter up drunk from a house party?,"I'm going to try to keep this short and simple. I always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and I'll drop whatever I'm doing and I will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. I let them know that I used to be a teenager once before, I told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. We're only human and it's a part of life.

Last weekend I got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. She was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

I got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. I had to pick her up and carry her to the car. I told her I was disappointed that she snuck out, but I also told her I was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

UPDATE: My Landlord has 'revoked' permission to hospice at home. Wtf do i do.,"Because I know you lovable assholes are all about the updates...and seriously, thanks for all the kindness on my post.  You all helped break the cycle of panic.

Original:  https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8nxple/colorado_my_landlord_has_revoked_permission_for/

Turns out it wasn't my landlord at all.  It was my roommate SAYING my landlord had said I couldn't hospice there.

Yeah.  I know.

I specifically moved in with this person for this reason...with the understanding I would be dying in this house.  I'm not sure if it was malice or just idiocy but apparently she thought that 'terminally ill' was just a cutsie designation or something?  And I guess she thought it wouldn't actually happen.  So instead of telling me six months ago, or three months ago, or when the hospice nurse started coming to the house...she tells me three weeks into hospice care that, supposedly, the landlord says ""You can't do in-home hospice here"".  


Obviously this is super illegal (thanks, LA!), and I call my lawyer who calls me back at noon on a fucking Saturday to say nofuckingwayisthisokayholyshit.  Lawyer wants the landlord's contact info asap so we can get moving on this immediately.

I started to get suspicious when the roommate wouldn't give me the contact info for the landlord...finally, after I threatened roommate with lawyers, roommate gave landlord's info to me... and I call landlord and of course the landlord had no clue what I was talking about because roommate hadn't even discussed it with her.

So yes, it is an illegal eviction and interestingly because I subtenant to the roommate and not the landlord,yes, we are going to pursue it fully.  My attorney is thrilled, my landlord didn't do anything wrong and is will be getting rid of a super shady tenant (my roommate), and my roommate will have to pay for what she did, hopefully.  Everybody wins?  

Except I still gotta die, yo.  After I move lol.  At least I can afford it I guess.  :( 

Thanks LA.   ",legaladvice

"LPT: When baking cookies, take them out when just the sides look almost done, not the middle.

People then let the cookies rest after and they often get over-baked and end up crunchy, crumbly, or burnt.

TIFU by instinctively making a joke in physics class,"Normal physics class and just after our trials examinations. We were all trying to discuss our papers in the class while the lecturer was explaining to the few who personally asked her at the front desk. We had the choice to listen to her explanations or do our own studies to prepare ourselves for AS examinations. I was too focused on my own mistakes, the first few parts of the papers.

After some time, she was explaining a question which got the majority of the class. It was a cupboard supported by a nail which is against a wall. The following question was ""How much weight can the cupboard support before it falls?"" It was a multiple choice question with the answers being something around 12kg, 22kg, 220kg and 2200kg. It was 220kg.

My friend was really bugged about it and proceeded to rant to me about it. Keep in mind, I was not paying attention at all towards her or the question as I was a dumb idiot trying to understand simple questions.

Friend: This doesn't make any sense. From my point of view, a cupboard can't hold that much.

Me: It's Physics, what else do you expect.

Friend: A nail can't withstand that much weight.

Me: It kind of did for Jesus.

I felt a slight tap and saw my friend pointing to the front. Only after I saw my lecturer's face, I realised what I said. My lecturer was in a serious mood during these past couple of weeks as our examinations were coming soon. Also, she is a pious Christian. On the bright side, the weather outside the classroom was lovely.

TL;DR: A friend asked how a nail help a cupboard support a big weight. I said it did for Jesus. Lecturer heard and sent me out of class.

TIFU by showing my Tinder date's mom my bare ass.,"Obligatory it happened a month ago. 

I started hooking up with this guy from Tinder. He lives with his brother in an apartment, and his mother comes occasionally to spend time with them. 

We decided to indulge in a little herb smoking one Saturday night. The munchies kicked in around 2AM so we made some potato wedges in the air fryer. Came back and spooned to sleep. 

I wake up the next morning, with his morning wood pressed to my butt. This, for some reason turned me on and we proceeded to have lazy spooning sex at 6:30AM.  

Midway through it, we heard his apartment's main door open. Tinder dude stopped and got up, confused. I was still lying on the bed, wearing his t-shirt and boxers, which were pulled down to my knees. Ass visible, in all it's glory. 

Now I was still under the impression that his room's door was locked. I was wrong. His mother opened the door and I swear she had the same expression as the shocked Pikachu meme. :o

She immediately closed the door. I ran to the washroom and got dressed, and hid inside for a good 20 minutes trying to figure out if jumping from the washroom window would be a good escape plan or not. 

Turns out she came early to take the dog (who was in the same room as us the entire time) for her vet appointment. 

I left as soon as she left.

She later had a conversation with her 22 year old son about consent, and respecting women. She asked him if I was his girlfriend, to which he had to explain his very catholic mother that ""we're just two friends trying to figure things out"". 

Spoiler: we ended up dating. Thankfully his mother joked it off the next time we met saying ""hi, I'm *****, Tinder guy's mom. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself the last time we met."" (Chuckles). 

Tl;dr: Tinder date and I got too baked and forgot to lock the room. Woke up the next morning to pip pip the diddly doo and got walked in on by the dude's mum. And that's the story of how my now SO's mom saw my bare ass before she could see my face first.

PS:  we never ate the wedges and he found them lying in the air fryer a week later. 

Edit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!

Edit 2: holy shit I can't believe this blew up. My account is juuuusssttt 4 days old. Man I love Reddit. 

Edit 3: This one's more like a clarification. I live in a non first world country where it's fairly common for people to live with their parents/for parents to come over. His mom was supposed to pick the dog up to take her to the vet, and was being nice by not wanting to wake her son up. She had the house keys, which is again, fairly normal here. WE were dumbasses.

AITA for withholding from my children that my husband had a wife and child before he met me? They've just found out and are acting like I've betrayed them.,"My children are 17 and 14 respectively, and I'm hoping the fact that they're teenagers is the reason for their incredibly shitty behavior. 

My husband, before he met me, had a wife and a newborn baby that passed away in Canada due to hazardous road conditions that resulted  in a 4 car smash up. No one was at fault, it was a horrific disaster, and my husband was devastated as a result and fell into alcoholism to cope. 

I had my own trauma from the past, and similarly turned to alcoholism to cope. It was at an AA meeting where we met, 20 years ago almost to the day now, and we slowly started to heal together here in the US. 

I have always been incredibly respectful of my husbands last wife and child. I like to joke that I'm keeping her seat warm until my husband enters heaven. I've had too much loss and hurt in my life to feel jealousy like this, and tbh- I am so damaged that I just feel lucky that I got to actually feel love in this world and that my husband could open his beautiful heart to me. 

We had two children- two sons. We'd never told them about my husbands wife or baby, because it's a part of my husbands life that he keeps under lock and key. 
He has never healed from his grief, and therapy etc has helped him only to a degree. 

My mother in law told the kids this Sunday gone, as she decided it was 'time for them to know'. She didn't consult us before telling them, and certainly didn't do it in our presence. 

Since then my sons have been making the most disgusting dead baby jokes, they've been prodding their dad asking why we'd never told them, and instead of approaching the topic with respect they're acting like we've kept a secret affair family from them or something. 

My 14 y/o went on to say to me in private, thank goodness not in front of his father, that he was glad my husbands previous family was dead. I broke and yelled at him, and told him it was the most disgusting thing I'd ever heard him say. I asked where his anger was coming from, and he burst forth that we were shitty parents for keeping secrets. 

He told me that it made 'so much sense' why we were abnormal, why we don't drink, why we are so boring and quiet, why my husband is panicky around roads, etc. 

the two are pretty heartbroken, and I feel like we have just destroyed a part of our children's lives as a result of us staying quiet. I am hurting, my husband is grieving all over again, and I don't know how to proceed. I have and will always reiterate to our kids that they are loved, but this behavior seems so overreactive for the news.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by making everyone in the elevator think that they were going to die.,"Alright, so this is an old story, but when I found this sub, I had to share.

When I used to be a Muslim, I had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.

I was on holiday the day of the fuckup. I got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the Paris attacks. There were roughly six people in it. Then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. For those who don't know, the adhaan starts with allahu Akbar. When that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. I had to explain to them that I wasn't a terrorist. Then everyone just started laughing.

I understand that everyone may think this isn't a fuckup, but I feel like I shouldn't have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the Paris attacks.

Tl;Dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks I'm about to blow up the elevator.

And one gripe, a large amount of negative comments,  in most of them the person commenting doesn't seem to understand the full magnitude of the incident and why it provoked that response, please take the effort to fucking understand what I wrote first :)

TIFU by going to the gym and immediately pinning myself to the weight bench so severely that I had to be rescued. Then I did something really embarrassing.,"


A few years ago I spent a Saturday blissfully tripping by myself. I had dosed that afternoon and I started coming down as the sun was coming up. It was a bright, crisp morning and I felt completely at peace. I was shuffling my music and Sunday Morning by The Velvet Underground came on. It was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.

I suddenly made a decision. I had to make some changes. I had to get my fat ass to the gym.

I was surprised to see so many people. I had thought, hey, 7am on a Sunday, I'll have the run of the place. I was obviously incorrect. All the cardio machines were taken. I couldn't just stand there. I was already getting sweaty and I'd been so high for so long so recently.

I saw an empty bench press and went for it. I couldn't remember what I used to bench back in school so I decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. I am 6'2 and 250 lbs. I was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.

It was heavier than I imagined. I figured my guns were rusty. I decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. Suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. It was all I could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. I let it sit on my chest while I came up with a plan. Every time I tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. I decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. With momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. Perfect. I tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.

*Wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*

The bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. I lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. Sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. If anyone heard it, they ignored it. Despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. It hurt. I slowed my breathing and just relaxed. It'll be ok, I thought. I got this, I prayed.

*Brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.

Nope, it's bad, this is bad. Everyone had to have heard the rounds I let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. The volume was incredible. No one knew I was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. No one laughed. Time was frozen but I assume only a few minutes passed. Finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. He looked up at me with genuine concern.

""Hey man are you alr-""

*popopopopopopop............WHHHOooooooot.*

To his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. More like a twitch. I nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. I tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. He left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. Everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. All I wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. Like I wasn't bothered at all.

So, knowing I was being observed, I did this. I stood tall, nodded to myself like I nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *Alright*

**Fuck.**

**Me.**

The door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. I ran to my car.

I can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. There is nothing funny about The Clap. It pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp.¬†I just wanted to look like a normal human being.

TL;DR I went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak I am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until I was rescued. Then I pretended I had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *Alright* as if I could alter reality by sheer force of will.",tifu

TIFU by snacking my wife's sister on the ass during a coed softball game thinking she was my wife.,"Most TIFUS don't get posted the same day they happened, this one is no different.
Flash back 3 and a half years ago to our fall league of softball. My wife's family always has a softball team every year in their church league and our team consists of my wife, her 3 other sisters, their husband's, my father in law, myself and normally one random girl that normally changes from year to year.

Just a little back story, my wife is 135 lbs but also has a generously large behind for her size and I being a male, enjoy smacking it for obvious reasons. (told you it was a little back story) 

Cut to me making the 3rd out by catching a fly ball in left center and jogging into the dugout behind everyone. Upon reaching the dug out, I see my wife in front of me walking in. I decided to take my baseball glove, reach back, and slap her on the ass.  Immediately something felt off. I've smacked my wife's ass a lot, she enjoys it and she knows I enjoy it. The reciprocating ripple that normally can be felt when slapping her behind normally was not felt. My wife's sister turns around (who is much much MUCH more conservative when it comes to intimacy or even being premiscoous) and my jaw drops. 
""I.. Uh... Thought you were.. Zelda"" I babbled 
I start panicking because I just spanked my sister in law's ass in front of the entire game and didn't want to be murdered by my wife. I turn some shade of red and started contemplating how to injure myself so I could get away from my soon to be death. 
Luckily my wife and all of her sisters are practically clones of each other, blonde hair blue eyes, and extremely beautiful (my wife being the best out of them all) they have been mistaken for each of the other ones their entire lives.
They all laugh and I am still made fun of every time we play. I now always make sure to look at my wife's face prior to spanking her bottom (in public) 

My wife loves bringing this story up to embarrass me now. 

TL:DR smacked my wife's sister on the ass because they all look the same and have the same body types, didn't get murdered but get made fun of to this day for it still",tifu

A couple of hours after getting home from work, I got a call from her asking to pick her up from the very restaurant I asked if we could go to, as she went out with her friends and got a little tipsy.

I (36M) think my wife of 8 years (31F) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42M),"Throw away for obvious reasons.

So my wife and I have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  At first it's good and we start communicating better.  

About three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". Alone.

Around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

She starts telling her friends about ""Danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which I think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""Dr. Soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""Danny"".  (I don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

Around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and I were intimate.

There have been a couple of other weird coincidences that I thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  She went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  It was about 9;30 at night and that seemed REALLY odd to me.

About a half hour later I tracked her iPhone and the location showed up as his office.

When she came home 3 hours later, I asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know Jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

I think I'm going to confront them in the session this Thursday.",relationship_advice
"My (18F) best friend (18F) cheated on her boyfriend (21M), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. Should I tell him?","Ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. Also I know this is pretty fucked up but Natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

We graduated high school this summer so our friends and I all went on a small vacation to Italy. We found a Groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. Natalie is dating Eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. It was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. It's pretty well known among us friends that Dylan who is in our high school, likes Natalie. He's like really into her. Well when we all went to Europe, since Eric wasn't there, Natalie was all over Dylan. Acting like a couple, being all flirty. They'd SLEEP in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. Well, I shared a room with Natalie and I walked in on them having sex. Afterwards I asked her what she was doing since she was dating Eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. It was not. We were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. Dylan's dreams came true that week. But only I knew about it since it was our room. Everyone else had their suspicions but I was the only one who really knew the truth. 

When we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on Eric again. She kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. So I promised to keep her little fling a secret. Fucked up I know but I have more loyalty to Natalie than Eric. 

She continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and I asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if I slapped her across the face. She said it's obviously Eric and I reminded her about Dylan and she insisted that Eric is the father and to never mention Dylan in front of her again. She's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told Eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. She told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. He wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

Y'all. Dylan is obviously the father. Like 100%. They were fucking like rabbits in Italy and I don't think she knew how to say ""where can I buy condoms"" in Italian. I feel bad for Eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

I love Natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like I feel really bad for Eric. I know she's scared and Eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. Dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. Eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. But it's not fair for him. I know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

I don't know like if I tell Eric, Natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",relationship_advice
AITA - parents lost all my uni work two days before my deadline,"This is literally happening right now and I'm not sure how I feel or if I'm being an arsehole here, I'm feeling many emotions right now...

For some context, I had a university deadline last Friday, and another university application deadline this Friday.

When I moved out a few years ago my parents insisted on keeping all my college and university so they could keep it safe, I thought fair enough, they have a much bigger house and the space available to keep everything in one place and safe. Since then, extensive clearing out has occurred at my parents house.

Fast forward to last month and I let my mum know that I would be needing my sketchbooks from my uni work in order to apply onto master programmes. I keep mentioning it and she keeps saying she'll get dad to look in the attic for them. This Sunday comes round, i go over to pick them up and no one has looked for them yet. 


Last night they let me know that they can't find anything. They've found my brothers stuff and a lot of scrappy stuff but nothing that resembles three years of university work...


Long story short, my parents have basically lost my uni work, my application to these other universities is now compromised, mum is saying i need to sort this out myself now as she thinks I've given them a hard time

Am I the asshole?


Edit 1: Thankyou to everyone who had commented, I will include a bit more info below as I've seen a few re-occuring comments.

1. I don't live at home, and I contacted my parents a month prior to the deadline, and kept reminding until I could get home. 

2. When at home I had searched the house with no luck, my parents said they had put everything in the attic for safe keeping - the attic doesn't have a drop down ladder and unless you're over 6ft like my dad, it's impossible to get inside. My work was apparently somewhere i could not physically get to. 

3. Im an architecture student, and whilst i do have digital presentation sheets, the emphasis of the interview is sketchbooks, hand drawn sheets and models - which i found trashed in the attic (the models). 

4. My parents have not apologised or spoken to me since Wednesday and my deadline is today. 

5. My portfolio was planned out way before the deadline, i had the sheets on photoshop set up with all the titles and annotations, all i needed was my sketchbooks, models and larger drawings to take to a plotter (i had an appointment booked) to scan and import.",AmItheAsshole

(FL) Help! My girlfriend is threatening to tell the police I abuse her if I leave her and I am terrified for my future.,"Posting this here after originally posting on r/relationshipadvice.

My girlfriend is threatening to call the cops on me if I leave her and has told me in a very serious conversation that she will tell them I beat her and will take me to court and have me arrested. She has told me on the day that I leave her she will come to my house and wait outside, call the cops and tell them I just kicked her out after hitting her. I just started a new job and I have no criminal record and am absolutely terrified this girl will ruin my life. Should I get a restraining order before any of this could happen? Please please help me I am in serious fear for my future, career and life.

A few changes that happened last night from my original posting of this: almost every comment recommended I get a recording, so once she calmed down a bit I did tell her she needed to tell me on recording that I have never hit her and she did, only it was a close up to her face and not her entire body and she was laughing a bit thinking it was a joke just so I'd calm down. Even though she admitted to the fact that I don't hit her, could a good lawyer argue that I forced her into this admittance since our environment can not be seen?",legaladvice

General advice for anyone trying to decide whether to stay in or go back to a relationship,"If you are wondering whether you should stay in a relationship or go back to your ex, I have a mental exercise for you.

&#x200B;

Close your eyes and imagine you are holding a puppy- any breed you like. Feel it's warm weight against your chest, it's soft sweet breath on your neck. Stroke the puppy's soft fur, feel the fineness of its skin and the delicate bones beneath, touch it's tiny paws, smooth and soft against your skin, kiss its little domed skull and look into its gentle, trusting eyes.

&#x200B;

Are you holding your puppy? Do you feel its softness, it's warmth, its vulnerability- that soft little mouth, peach like nose and all those fragile little bones? Do you feel its weight in your arms, snuggling up against your heart- trusting and relying on you.

&#x200B;

OK, now give that puppy to your partner/ ex.

&#x200B;

If the breath stills in your lungs, if your heart clenches, if you hesitate, then you need to ask yourself why.

&#x200B;

Is it because they are a bully- who would shout at and hit the puppy, bruising that thin skin and breaking those fragile bones? Is it because you know that they'd neglect the puppy, leaving it alone, possibly hungry and cold and ignoring its cries for attention and affection. Is it because they are contradictory- a person who is nice whilst the world is going their way but who will turn on you for breathing if something goes wrong in their life?

And, if you'd hesitate over giving that puppy to your partner, why the hell are you giving yourself to them?! Aren't you worth as much as an imaginary dog?

&#x200B;

Too often, in life, we seriously undervalue ourselves and excuse away behaviours which we'd find inexcusable if another person was subjected to them. However, we are just as vulnerable and breakable as the next person- and just as valuable.

&#x200B;

So, don't put up with behaviours which you wouldn't wish on a dog. If someone abused a puppy, you'd take that puppy out of the situation- do the same for yourself. If someone ignored their puppy, spending all of their time with other people/ doing other things, you'd know that the puppy was not getting the physical, mental and emotional stimulation it needed and you'd find someone who had time for the puppy- again, do the same for yourself. If someone abandoned a puppy, leaving it crying, you wouldn't chase after the person to give the puppy back to them... You're getting the drift?

&#x200B;

Value yourself. And, if it helps, think of your soul as that puppy you imagined. Look into its trusting eyes- its relying on you to find someone kind, someone patient, someone with love and time to give. You are responsible for your own health and happiness and that loving, caring person might be sitting there lonely, waiting for someone just like you to come into their life.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_EDIT\_\_\_\_\_

  
Someone asked ""What if you know you mistreat the puppy yourself too?""

The answer is simple: take a long, hard look at how you treat the people in your life and work out how you can change your behaviour so that you can treat 'the puppy' (e.g. friends/family/your S.O) well.

We're all 'bad' people to some extent; all greedy, lazy, selfish, hypocritical, temperamental, judgemental, cowardly and even cruel. However, what you are isn't the end of the story. A 'good' person is someone who looks at their options, second by second, and always tries to chooses to take the better path; it's not the only path or the easiest path but they choose the right path because they have self-respect.

These 'choices' can happen at the deepest of levels; whatever people say, we can actually control our thoughts and our feelings if we put in the effort: for example, you might look at someone and think 'ugly' but, if you're trying to be a better person, you'll then think to yourself 'No, stop that. It's unkind and shallow'. Or you might see someone with something you want and feel a stab of jealousy, then think 'why am I jealous, I've got my friends, my family, etc and that's more important than x'. Choices- every moment of every day- and if you try to think only kind, rational thoughts and feel only kind, positive feelings, then you'll find it easier and easier to do the right thing.

It is the choices we make in life which are important; make the kindest, most selfless and thoughtful choice and you'll find that you are happier because you'll be able to look in the mirror and see someone you respect.

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_EDIT 2\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

I've written an additional edit because certain questions/comments seem to reoccur and, as there have been so many comments, my original answers to substantially similar questions/comments are now a couple of pages back and I know repeating/copy-pasting annoys people.

&#x200B;

Edit 2A:

If you are allergic to or don't like dogs, you can also visualise another type of animal or a human baby if that is more relevant to you.

&#x200B;

Edit 2B:

A number of people have been making comments along the lines of 'my Ex/S.O. is great with animals/loves dogs but treats/treated me badly"" or ""is a vile person""

If your ex/S.O would treat/treats their dog better than they treat you:

a. make a list, one with the differences between their behaviour to you and their behaviour towards the dog;

b. do the visualisation again, but imagine that they'd treat the puppy just like they treated you.

&#x200B;

You wouldn't leave an abused/neglected dog with someone just because they were kind to their other pet and, more importantly...

&#x200B;

\*\*\*You are more important than an imaginary dog!\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Edit 2C:

Emotional distress. Some abusive behaviours, e.g. adultery, won't affect a dog like they do a human partner. However, the important point is that pain and distress caused. If a person does something knowing it will cause severe hurt, then use a comparative physical hurt in your visualisation.

&#x200B;

Edit 2D.

Finally, people have also commented that this doesn't apply to situations where people are just incompatible. No, it doesn't; it was designed to help people with high levels of empathy to realise that they need to protect themselves as much as they'd protect an animal.

&#x200B;

However, that said, anyone who has ever bought a dog from a reputable breeder will know that great humans will not be allowed to buy a great dog if they are fundamentally incompatible. If you want a collie and your favourite past-time is sitting on your backside, no reputable breeder will let you walk away with a pup because, although you might be the nicest, kindest person in the world, you will be driven up the wall by an energetic dog who will be literally running up the walls if they don't spend hours hiking around the countryside.

Where there's incompatibility, it often leads to both parties making compromises for the duration of their relationship. People rarely change in fundamentals and you need to ask yourself; 1. what compromise/s do we need to make to meet each other half way? 2. am I willing/able to make my compromises? 3. is my S.O. also willing/able to make their compromises? 4. will we both be able to live, long term, in the compromise situation? If the answer to any of these questions is no, you are going to get frustrated with each other, the frustration will probably turn into irritation and the irritation will probably turn into recrimination because we all, secretly think 'if they love me, they will change' without asking ourselves 'if I love them, why don't I change?'

So, if you are a collie and your S.O is a couch potato, then you'll either have to accept that you'll get 50% of the exercise you need and they will have to do 50% more than they want OR you go and do your exercise whilst they play video-games and you meet up for meals. Or you break up and make sure that, in the future, you automatically rule out anyone who is not in running gear!",relationship_advice

[CO] My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. She now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. I want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.,"Me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. There were a variety of reasons for this that I wont get into here. One of them though was her anti-science beliefs. She's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. Well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200B;

We have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. Well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. My ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. And threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200B;

Around this time I also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. When this happened I decided I wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. The only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. My ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. The judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200B;

Ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" I demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. So, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. Well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. She somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. I have been stressed out from the minute I got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. My daughter must have picked up on this and thought I was mad at her because when I was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200B;

Turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. She made my daughter lie about it. Instead she has been using ""Special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" What about the forms I got saying she was vaccinate? There fake. I called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. So my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200B;

I'm pissed to say the least. My daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. My ex doesn't know I know yet and I told my daughter not to tell her, I want her gone now. How do I approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. I have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. I also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones I have a forged.

Back in November 2018 I was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. It was the most humiliating thing I've ever experienced. I later learned at the police station that I was being charged with multiple felonies. This came as a huge surprise. Luckily I was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. For $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, I was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. However it cost me everything and I was unable to pay my bond. This resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. At a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and I ended up having all my charges dismissed. When I finally got out I learned that I had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. His mother is a heroine addict and I haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. They wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200B;

Since my release, I've learned that I can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that I was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. I've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. They took down my info but never followed up. So what I did was create a website sharing my story. I also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. Literally the only reason why I was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. If the detective had done his job, he could have verified that I wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. This is what pisses me off the most. My life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200B;

I'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. I live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. My web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. I received a cease and desist letter recently, which I showed to my attorney. He said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything I had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. Yesterday I received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. He apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" They then talked to me about my website and asked if I could remove it. I said I would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. Suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200B;

After the visit I received, I'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. I don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. My friends think I'm being spiteful and have suggested that I just delete it. AITA for keeping my website up?

In Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.

One thing I learned is that RKN doesn't want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.

How Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.

Will I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.

BTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.

AITA for stranding a date without a ride because she was ignoring me?,"So last weekend I went on a tinder date with a girl who I've been chatting to for a while. It was our second date and I thought things were going pretty well.

We end up at this rowdy bar a bit far out (30-40min) which I recommended. It was good fun until she sees someone she knows, this guy she went to college with, and they start chatting. I awkwardly try to join in but I'm basically ignored. I leave them to it to get some food and come back like 30 min later. They're still chatting. I stand around like an idiot trying to join the convo but at one point the guy literally blocks me out with his back and my date says and does nothing. They back into a corner and only talk to each other. 

At this point I go out and grab a smoke. She comes out after me and apologizes, says she hasn't seen this guy in ages. I tell her that's cool but I'm just gonna head home soon. She asks me to wait for her bc she doesn't have a ride and it's far from home. 

So I wait bc whatever, night is ruined and I might as well just hang out. I wait another 20 min before heading back inside to tell her I'm going home and she can either come with me or stay. I see them in the same corner with the guy blocking my view. I try to talk to her but he keeps turning to block me away. I gesture to her that I'm going and she holds up a finger like ""wait a minute"" and instead of coming to talk to me she just keeps talking to her friend. 

I've had it at this point and I just text her ""leaving now, bye"" and head straight to my car and leaves. I get frantic calls about 15 min later. She asks me where I am and if I could go back and pick her up since she doesn't have a ride and her friend doesn't live close to her like I do. I say ""no"" and hang up. 

Anyways the next day I get the longest, angriest chain of texts in my life. She's upset because I left her with no ride and she had to beg the bartender to call her a cab because she ran out of cash and can't get uber/lyft for some reason. She calls me a POS and to never call her again and that she'll be telling anyone she knows not to ever go on a date with me.

After fees and taxes, my dad was paying $270/mo for the whole package, and though I don't know the cable/phone details, I do know we were only getting 20 Mbps down/2 Mbps up internet speed. That didn't seem right to me, so I went and took alook.

On their website, this ISP does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down/2 up internet speed. They do have a 10d/1u single-user service (standalone internet), but in their package deals, they only had 50, 100, 500, and 1000 internet speeds (no 20).

Turns out, we've been paying for the same service *at the same rate* for the past 15+ years. So while high-speed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down, we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s.

One call to the ISP, our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem. We are now getting 1Gbps ~~up~~ down, 50 Mbps ~~down~~ up, have the same phone and cable service as before, and are paying $30 a month **less** than before.

Edit: For like the 50th time, I typed down when I meant to type up, and up when I meant to type down. My speed is 1G down, 50M up, not the other way around.

Also, as people have mentioned in the comments, **this doesn't apply to every ISP** and in fact some ISPs will do the opposite: they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if you're a longtime user, as their good deals are only for new customers. WOW seems to be pretty decent as far as customer service goes, but I can't speak for any other ISP.",LifeProTips

Neighbor cut down my tree without my consent. Is this legal?,"Anyone familiar with property law/laws in NE Florida? I came home yesterday from work and noticed my giant oak tree was cut down.

The tree canopy did cross into their property and over their home but i don't think that allows them to cut down the whole tree.

[Update] I [34/m] found condom wrappers in our trash can. My wife [34/f] and I don't use them and I'm wondering how to approach this.,"Link to previous thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ba2nt4/i_34m_found_condom_wrappers_in_our_trash_can_my/).

Opinion on whether I should talk to my wife or not was pretty even and quite divisive at times.  Ultimately I decided to talk to her for a few reasons.  She wasn't exhibiting any other suspicious behavior that I could tell.  I know her pretty well and I think I can read her reactions to things well too.  And she's my wife, she's been honest and faithful, as far as I can tell, for the 15 years we've been together.  I owe her the benefit of the doubt.  And finally if she was cheating, she was getting away with it, so maybe bringing this up would shake something loose and I'd figure out what was going on.

I brought it up pretty casually.  Just ""Hey, I found condom wrappers in the trash can outside, any idea where they came from?""  We discussed it pretty calmly.  She didn't have any idea where they came from and suggested some of the same theories that you guys did and that I had thought of myself.  There was no indication she was lying or hiding anything.  She understood why I was concerned and didn't freak out and accuse me of not trusting her.  

So that's pretty much the end of it I guess.  I don't see any further evidence that she's cheating and I'll chalk it up to one of those weird things that happens sometimes.  I'll probably be on higher alert for odd behavior for awhile, but that's really all I can do.  Sorry it's not the fun drama-filled update you were all hoping for.",relationship_advice

I just wanted him to let me breathe. Then he slapped me back and started choking me again. I didn't pass out but my vision was going black. He got off me and left the room.

So for this year, I posted a tribute for my late-girlfriend onto my FB. It was just 4 pictures (1 of her, 2 of us holding hands/hugging, and 1 of us in her office when she first got hired). I wasn't too over-romantic, but said ""I'll always miss you, and you will always be a big part of who I am. I hope you are proud of me.""

A few hours later though my wife texted me and was furious. She asked if I  loved her or if I wanted to get a divorce. She told me it was slap her in face to post my ex onto my FB. Of course I love my wife more than anything, and my intentions were not to harm her in anyway, so I felt guilty and took down the post. Was I out of line here?

"(update) [Nebraska] I just closed on a new house, sellers allege that I owe a portion of their 990$ security system cancellation fee because I did not take over their contract. Threatening small claims court.","https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9h80ot/nebraska_i_just_closed_on_a_new_house_sellers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

Thank you to all of the people who commented on the original thread. This was my first time dealing with small claims court and all of the helpful advice and information really helped set me up for success.


So, short story is that the sellers did end up taking me to court for roughly $1,400. This was for the total cost of the contract buy out for their security system, travel expenses since they moved out of state and would need to pay for gas and lodging to come back to sue us, as well as court costs. 


Small claims court was surprisingly straight forward and informal. I've never been a big talker, but I honestly don't think I was able to say more than three words at a time without the plaintiff interrupting me. The judge eventually asked her to please stand in the hall way so I could speak my side fully. She absolutely refused to leave, but did stay quiet for a short minute so I could say that I never agreed to take over her security contract, and there was no documentation to suggest that I did.


The judge agreed and ended up ruling in my favor. I thought it was done there but the plaintiff swiftly appealed the decision. So now we had a new court date early this month with a different judge. 


During this time the plaintiff continues to send me hostile emails and voice messages. The seller's broker (their realtors boss) called me while I was at work to tell me he was very displeased I filed a formal complaint against his realtor. He told me I was not welcome to pursue any future business with his company, and I assured him the feeling was mutual. The broker said he supports all of his realtors and will not be acting on the complaint in any way. So I went and talked to the mayor's office about the situation. The mayor asked me what I wanted out of this, and I showed him the hostile emails from the seller and told him I felt it was the realtor's job to act as an in-between, even after the sell was complete. The mayor said he would step in and speak with the broker. (This is a fairly small town, they probably already knew each other). 


I never heard from the seller again after that, thanks mayor. So now it comes time for round 2 in small claims court. The new judge goes through and reads the write up from round 1 and asked the plaintiff if there is new evidence or information that has not been covered. Long story short, there was not. The judge ended up sustaining the previous ruling in my favor, and strongly advised the plaintiff not to appeal unless there is new evidence or information that has not been seen by the court.


It's been five days and no word on an appeal so I think it's safe to say I'm finally done and ready to put this whole ugly thing behind me. Once again thank you to all of you who helped me on the original thread. I'm very pleased that resources like this community exist.


On a final note, gossip, but I got a call from the mayor at 2am the night before last because there was a house fire down the street from me. (The mayor and I know each other well). So I went to go help the volunteer fire brigade put it out. We got it under control and we were winding down when a deputy from the sheriff's office comes to tell me that the lady who sued me waited around the court building the day of the appeal for the judge to get off, then tried to confront him about the ruling in the courthouse parking lot. I didn't really care to hear about it, but it sounds like she's in some pretty deep shit now. Kind of cathartic.


TL;DR: They lost and I think it's finally over.

EDIT: thank you for all of the very kind and thoughtful messages! To clarify some common questions, the ruling stipulated that the plaintiff pays all court costs, including my own. Yes, I could probably countersue, but I'm very interested in dealing with the seller and broker as little as possible for the rest of my life. :)

AITA for (rudely) refusing to give my kid's hand-me-downs and old toys & furniture to my sister?,"I found out I was pregnant with my daughter at 19 years old, had her at 20. When I told my parents they said they'ld be happy for me but they didn't want to pay for anything, have us live with them or babysit all the time, basically wanting to treat me they same they would if I had kids older and not as a teenager still going to university. I was already living independently, both my boyfriend and I worked and we live in a country with free/cheap education and healthcare. In our culture families are close and grandparents are very involved in their grandchildren's lives, so I thought they'd still be emotionally supportive.

During my pregnancy I asked my parents and/or sister for help a few times: driving me to the hospital when I started contracting 3 months early, picking me up for a family event when I wasn't allowed to drive, helping me prepare meals to put in the freezer, and staying with them for a weekend when I was due any day and my boyfriend couldn't be home. They refused, telling me that I was expecting to be catered to. They also didn't want to come with me to ultrasounds or basically hear me talking about anything baby related, telling me that I was trying to win them over and have them ""forget that I was making dumb decisions"". When I spoke to other relatives my sister ""joked"" that I was trying to get gifts from them. I had severe post-partum depression and thought I was an entitled jerk and a failure, unworthy of the baby or anybody's support but impoved a lot after months of therapy. My relationship with my parents started improving after they apologised for not getting me to the hospital. They told me they were afraid I was going to destroy my life and thought that they were showing tough love. Impovement in our case meant that we we're on speaking terms and they're allowed in their granddaughter's life, we're not close.

Which brings us to today, 3 years later. My sister (29yo) is pregnant and she's getting a completely different treatment than I did when I was treated ""as an independent adult"". Our parents stay with her when her husband isn't home, don't let her do any housework, paid for her birthing class and a maternity photoshoot and get her whatever she craves to eat. Yesterday my mother called and asked me to bring over to her house all of my daughter's old furniture, toys and anything else of her baby stuff I have kept because she wants to set up a nursery so my sister's baby will have everything they need when she babysits. Apparently my sister wanted my parents to buy some new stuff to keep at their house but my mother told her mine will do. I answered that mine will not do, my sister should try to get freebies from other relatives instead, and ended the call. I've been getting texts from my parents and sister telling me to come to my senses and calling me petty, immature and resentful among other things.

TIFU by closely following a woman around a lingerie store,"This happened just today. I (male) was in a lingerie store with my girlfriend, she was shopping for new underwear and I was just following her around, bored as always, staring at my phone to keep myself occupied.

After about 5-10 minutes a man grabs my arm, I turn and it's the security guard. He asks me to leave and starts escorting me towards the exit. I'm confused about what's happening and look around for my girlfriend, who I can't find.

Apparently at some point, while not paying attention to anything other than my phone, I'd stopped following my girlfriend (who was wearing a white cardigan and black trousers) and instead had started following some other random woman who was wearing similar clothes. I'd apparently been doing this for at least a few minutes, silently standing closely behind her as she browsed underwear and following her to do it again as she tried to move away. She'd alerted a member of staff with a horrified look towards them.

Some people are just plain stupid and should be given up on,"I'm a tutor and a substitute teacher working on getting a full time credential. The mantra is always something about no child left behind or how every kid has potential to do good. 

No. Some kids are just fucking stupid. 

I've tutored a high schooler who legitimately did not know what 2+2 was, and they weren't special Ed or trying to be funny or anything like that. Some people are just stupid and it's their own fault they fail, not the fault of anyone around them. No amount of extra hard work from their teachers or tutors will make them smarter. They'll always be stupid. They're the kids where you painstakingly walk them through every single step in solving a problem, and then for the next one they have no idea what to do even though it's the exact same problem with slightly different numbers or words, and then you repeat this process every day 5 days a week until it's summer break and you've gotten nowhere the entire time with them. 

They should be given up on. These people don't even want to succeed in academics. They're the ones talking about how you can't ask a fish to climb a tree to justify how it's okay that they suck at important life skills but they're semi decent at fortnite dancing and hot dog eating, as if the skills are comparable in value. Not only are they so thick that their brain is locked behind an impenetrable brick wall, but they straight up don't even think an education is valuable so they don't give a shit anyways. It's a waste of everyone's time to force teachers to teach at the pace of the slowest kid, take time away from those who can learn to dedicate more time to the idiot, and to hire a tutor to try to magically make the idiot smarter. 

Valuable time and resources dedicated to helping these failures shouldn't be given to them. That extra time should be spent working with the kids who actually can learn and want to learn. Plenty of parents have thrown hundreds of dollars at me a month to make their kid smarter and get better grades, only for their kid to be completely hopeless. It was a waste of their money and I knew from the first day that their kid wouldn't learn shit from me. 

These kids just need to be left behind. It's not right to make everyone else worse off just to try to pour resources and time into a human who's brain is a bag with a hole in the bottom. 

Edit: just wanted to point out that someone took the time to PM me and say I'm a dick and a toad because people make way more money playing fortnite and eating hotdogs than the $5 an hour he assumes teachers make. I'll just let that stand for itself. 

Edit 2: just to clarify since I can't reply to hundreds of comments, what I am NOT advocating for is throwing these kids out on the streets. What I am saying is that right now the sole goal of our education system is to get kids into college. That should change. Some kids aren't capable of that and that's okay. We should push some people into more realistic work and blue collar jobs instead of ONLY trying to get kids to have a high enough GPA for college. Give up on trying to teach a kid a life skill they won't use and try teaching them something else valuable to society.",unpopularopinion

Honestly I didn't really think about myself the ever since the accident, all I cared for was my girlfriend. But we kept talking and I ended up breaking down, because right there was the moment where I realized that this also has an impact on me, and our relationship. One thing that keeps repeating in my head is when she asked if I was my gf's caregiver. She has help that comes a few times a week, but I help her out whenever I can, though she doesn't always want me to. And if we stay together that's never going to change. I know how cruel this sounds but she will always be in a wheelchair.

"AITA for not punishing my son after he came up with a pretty elaborate plan to ""peep"" on the neighbor girl topless in her back yard?","Lots and lots of ugly background here but I'll try not to wander. My wife I have been separated for 2 years, ink to paper on an ugly and contentious divorce in May. I have primary custody of our two kids (daughter 17 and son 14) and live in the home which we've owned for 20 years. 

On Monday I came home to find my son and two of his friends up on the roof to our little sun deck. I asked him what he was doing and if he was being safe. They said they were playing army and since I've coached the other two kids in mountain biking for almost 6 years now, I knew their parents wouldn't mind either. So I told him to put the ladder away when he was done and to keep his phone on in case I needed him to come down. I was actually most perturbed because he didn't put the ladder away. So they did this every day this week until Thursday when my daughter came home from her CIT job and in her every so sweet and acerbic tone asked me if I was really so stupid to think my son and friends were playing Army and let me know that the real reason is that our 22 year old neighbor was in her back yard topless and Aiden had set up a perch on the sun deck to get a better view. I climbed up thinking that she was just trying to get him in trouble but sure enough, the deck had  perfect view of the chaise lounge where I assume the girl had usually sat. I told my son to knock it off and he said he would. 

This morning I got an angry knock on the door and it was my ex wife and the neighbor (they have been friends for many years) apparently the neighbor called my wife sometime mid week and they had agreed they would ""confront"" me and my son Saturday morning. We sat down and it went from a calm ""this is something we're concerned about"" to accusations of me being an irresponsible absentee parent and my son leading an ""adolescent sex ring"" in a matter of seconds. I tried to remain calm and explain that they are just acting like 14 year old boys and I've gotten them to stop. My wife asked if I planned on punishing him, I said that I don't feel like he did anything punishment worthy and rather this was a learning experience about respecting peoples privacy. My neighbor said that if he were her son he'd be in intensive psycho therapy and medicated. I told her that was really overkill. My wife told me not to talk to her friend like that and I asked them to leave before it got any more nuts. My wife has texted me that I am being incredibly irresponsible and if I don't do ""something"" she's going to her lawyer to revisit the custody arrangement.

Men who leave after learning their kids aren't theirs aren't doing anything wrong,"I was reading a post saying that if a man is with a woman raising a family and she tells him the kids aren't his, that he would be in the wrong to leave because ""the kid is innocent"" and that he is still obligated to be a parent to that kid because the woman trapped him by lying to him.

When I was in my twenties, I was very awkward and introverted. I didn't date many girls, because no one was interested in me. I met my wife in college. We had similar interests and I fell in love with her. I asked her out and she said yes. I was on cloud nine. And we never looked back.

She told me that she really matured at that time and realised that I was the mist important person in her life. She also claims that she never cheated on me once we got married.

The total suicides between ages 15-24 in 2014 was 5,079, meaning for every death by school shooting since 2000 about 19.5 suicides occurred. Now let's add in the 2017 numbers (6,265) to the 2014 numbers and we get 11,331 which brings the ration between suicides and school shooting deaths from 19.5-1 to 43.5-1. Now I couldn't find the total number of suicides in that age range since 2000 but let's take 11,331 and decide in half, we get 5,665.5 which when multiply that by 18 (counting from '00-18) we have an estimated 101,979 teen/young adult suicides between 2000 and 2018 bringing the ratio of suicides to school shooting deaths to about 392-1. Meanging for the 15 teens that died in Parkland 5,880 suicides occurred. No marches, no fanfare, no calls for awarness to this silent crisis, just empty handed memorial yearbook pages is all the honor theyll ever be given.",unpopularopinion

Then on top of that if a kid commits suicide, then boom if so much as a verbal report was made by someone being bullied and no real punishment was given to said bully then the school should be forced to pay out 51% of their networth to the parents of the kid and have it put down on public record what happened.",unpopularopinion

AITA for telling my ex I refuse to share custody of our daughter?,"My ex an I have an incredibly long history. We met when I was 18 and he was 19. He was my first love and we dated about a year. But after the break up we continued an off and on again friends with benefits relationship until I turned 23. Which was also the same time I found out I was pregnant...

He was going to school to be a doctor and he was in his second year of getting his doctorates when I found out. He also was studying in another state that was on the other side of the country. I got pregnant during one of his visits back home. 

When I found out I was pregnant I told him immediately. He was very very angry and asked what I was going to do about it. I told him I'd be keeping it and he told me he wanted no part in the child's life because it was going to ruin everything for him. I told him that wasn't an option. 

I myself grew up with my birth father jumping in and out of the picture and it's a big stem of my mental illnesses now. All things he knew.

After begging him to be in the baby's life throughout almost my entire pregnancy one day he and his parents called me and offered me a deal. They offered to pay me a very hefty child support until the day the child turned 18 if I never forced him to be a real father. His parents (who are very wealthy) promised to take care of everything.

At first I said no. I refused and called them all assholes and told them my baby was gonna have a dad... but after talking to many of my friends and family they thought it best I take the offer. They told me there was no use in forcing him to be a shitty dad to my baby. I finally agreed about 8 months into my pregnancy.

I took sole custody of course. It's been 7 years and I had a beautiful baby girl that I love more than anything on earth. Every single month I get a check and not once has it ever been late. I haven't seen or talked to my ex since the day he handed me the first check. Until about a week ago. 

I get a call and it's my ex. He tells me he wants to take joint custody of our daughter. The daughter he has never met in his or her life ever! I was infuriated and told him no. He told me that I can't just say no because he's gonna take me to court where a judge will decide. 

I was crying and screaming and asking why he was doing this. He told me he was sorry but he's ready to be a father and he wants to be there for our daughter. When I told him I was going to fight him with every fiber of my being to make sure he got nothing he told me I was being ridiculous and I need to grow up. 

I've told my family and friends and almost all of them have told me I need to give him a chance and that I'm just being a bitch. The only person that agrees with me is my mother who watched me get torn apart by my fathers constant jumping in and out of my life when I was a child. I know that this is going to be a hard fight and ultimately it is the courts decision but I just feel like I need to fight this. AITA for being so against him getting any custody?

Edit: for all the people that are confused about age. We met in late teens. Got pregnant when I was 23 and he was 24. I'm 30 now and he's 31.

Edit2: for all the people that are saying I'm TA for not getting an abortion. Thanks! BUT I remember asking if I was an ass for telling my ex I'll fight him over custody. Please stop telling me I should have aborted my 7 year old daughter. It's very much too late and I never asked for your opinion on that matter.",AmItheAsshole
[MA] Man that sold me a car called my insurance company and listed himself as a driver. Now they won't take it off until he verifies that we don't live together. He's blocked my number.,"I bought a car last year from a mutual friend that I didn't know well at all. Everything was fine until this past June, when he fell into some heavy debt. He gave me a call sometime around June, asking me to take out a loan for him, to which I refused. Red flag number one right there. After this, he began to harass and pester me for money (was already paying way more than I should've been monthly for this car). I eventually just gave the car back and that was that. I gave the car back mid July and purchased a new one (Nissan Altima) from a legitimate dealer. This morning I received a call from my insurance company (progressive), saying that this man has listed himself as a driver, costing me another $500. I calmly explained the situation, but they told me that unless he can provide proof that we don't live together, (we absolutely do not) I still have to pay it. This is absurd, how is this allowed? The guy in question is obviously desperate and trying to get back at me for giving the car back, but how can I provide proof for someone else? This is in Massachusetts and I have progressive insurance.


Update #1: okay so a lot has happened since I first posted. For starters, I should clarify some things. We signed an agreement that I would pay monthly increments for the title. Until the car (30k) was paid in full, he held onto the title. Initially he said I would be under his insurance, but only a few days after I saw this guy was kind of shady and switched to my own. I did not have the car in my name, which is why I was able to give it back so easily. I just thought ""screw this drama, I'll just get a new car."" Today my adjuster happens to be ""out sick"" but I reported this man to both the state and federal insurance fraud agencies. A representative of Progressive informed me that the man in question blatantly lied to my adjuster and told him we live together, and that he drives my vehicles occasionally. I have only spoken to him a number of times, so this is certainly not true. I've been in contact with a representative of both progressive and the insurance fraud agencies all morning and am finishing sending in documentation as we speak. I'm expecting a phone call and will update soon.

Update #2: Not much has changed since the last update, except everything has been officially reported with all required documentation. Luckily I kept all of the text messages between us, which I attached to the reports I filed. With my adjuster out today (of all days, just my luck) it's a bit difficult to get this taken care of. After I settle this, because I am NOT paying an extra $500, I will most definitely be switching providers.",legaladvice

Is it lame to report a shoplifter?,"I was in CVS yesterday and I saw this punk-ass 16 year old looking kid stuffing things into his hoodie so I went up to the register and told one of the guys working there. The kid tried to walk out and the employee stopped him, took the stuff back, and let the kid leave and then thanked me profusely when I was checking out.  

I told my SO about it and she called me a narc and said I'm lame. Her logic was that CVS was a big corporation so they wouldn't notice a few dollars in stolen goods and it's possible the kid was trying to feed his family. I said instead of stealing maybe he should get a part time job and work to feed his family like everybody else (it's not like we live in Chicago, we live in a middle-class suburb of a very rich city). 

Am I a lame old man for reporting the kid?

**Edit**: Based on everybody's replies I can see that this is a controversial topic. Overall, however, with your help I've decided that what I did was not lame. To all those saying I should evaluate my relationship, SO, etc., it's not like she was seriously upset that I reported the kid, she was just teasing. 

**Edit 2**: I've read through all the top-level comments I've gotten so far and it is almost exactly a 50-50 split. This is crazy interesting. What I don't get most is the people who say, ""it doesn't affect you, it's none of your business, just let it be."" I suspect those are the same people who hear their neighbor beating their wife through the apartment walls and don't do anything because, ""it's none of my business."" 

**Edit 2.5**: I went back to buy some cookies and it looks like the only thing stealable in the area he was was either alcohol or powdered Kool-Aid/Tang mix. Let me restate, this was in the alcohol aisle so he could've stole that before I got there. Not necessities.

AITA for requesting prayer breaks at work because my religious coworkers do even though I'm not religious?,"I'm an atheist who works in an international company in a very busy city. 

I have a lot of coworkers who come from a certain religious background that requires them to pray multiple times a day. I would say 90% of my coworkers share this faith and maybe 70-80% of them take the time out to go pray everyday. 

They get to leave the office 2 or 3 times in a day for 10 mins a piece for prayer and they get paid the same, don't need to take time out of their lunch, etc.  

I used to resent this and asked my boss who belongs to that faith why they were essentially having an extra paid 30 min break a day for doing the same work I do. She couldn't give me a response other than religious considerations have to be made. 

Even though I'm a known atheist I decided I too wanted some time to meditate everyday. I told my manager I needed the same time as my coworkers and told her it was very important to me. She initially said no, and then I got a hastily written email saying of course I was welcome to take that time to meditate the same day. She'd obviously checked with HR and covered her ass. 

For the last six months I've been having my 30 mins 'meditating' out in our company garden everyday. This has caused a slight issue because other non religious people are starting to ask if they too can have 'meditative time' and it's causing friction but imo either everyone should be able to have this or no one should. 

I recently told a friend this story and she reacted negatively- she said that I was being rude and 'ruining it' for everyone else and that at Xmas time my coworkers usually go over and beyond to fill in holiday hours so the rest of us can enjoy our holidays and that the same courtesy should be extended to them. I told her I'm not hurting anybody or taking their prayer times away from them, simply enjoying that privilege myself.",AmItheAsshole
Airport confiscated insulin,"My diabetic (t1) mother flew from Michigan to Florida today with a connecting flight in Philadelphia.

I also confirmed that she could bring a medical bag with get insulin and medication. When she landed in Philadelphia, they said they didn't have a chair for her so she had to walk across multiple terminals to get to her gate. When she was boarding the plane, the ticketing agent told her she couldn't bring the medical bag on board (basically an insulated lunch box). She explained it had insulin in it which she needs to have with her. They told her she could check it or she could stay in Philadelphia, but she couldn't bring it on board. She surrended the bag, boarded the plane super upset. When she landed in Tampa, the wheelchair guy was waiting for her. He took her to baggage claim and I guess her medical bag was lost. She is now in Florida with no insulin, no medication. Her doctors are working with her insurance to get authorization for her get enough to hold her over. 

I am beyond upset. I have called AA and they confirmed that insulin is allowed on board. What legal ramifications are there for this?

"Society needs to stop defending gang activity and ""hood life""","I'm not sure how to put this, the title really explains it the best here.  I'm also writing this at 4:46 AM so bear with me, I just wanted to put it down into words before I forgot.

I live in New York. I've seen my fair share of hoods.  And I browse social media and listen to tons of music, just to see people defending gang activity and such.

I really don't get it. People know killing and stealing is wrong, yet they glorify these people for their ""struggles"" when they definitely get involved with violent activity. Being poor does not give you the right to kill and steal! But people will blindly listen to hiphop and rap because it's ""woke"" and they sympathize with these asshole rappers. It's become cool to break the law because ""fuck the police"", and all police use excessive force, apparently.

People on social media seem to just be so proud of their gang relations, and the crimes they commit, and post about it to their blind audience who likes and retweets everything about it. People listen to hiphop where rappers sing about the atrocities they have and still commit, and people will be like ""yo i fuck with this"" and ""yo this is so woke"".   I fucking hate it.

Gangs have become a race thing. If you're against gangs, you're racist, it seems. People have tied gangs to specific races such as latinos and black people. And I think that's why it's normified, both indirectly and directly. I've literally seen movements such as ""protect our hoods"" try and directly stop deslumification. It's so stupid- there is nothing good about breaking the law or being in poverty. But people really think that this is how life is for black and latino people, which really contributes to the racism we have today.

I seriously wish we didn't come to this. A society of violent assholes seems to be on the rise to social acceptance, and it's a huge tumor to everyone. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of here. Defending rape, mugging, killing, drug dealing, etc. makes you just as bad as the person committing them.

AITA for telling a friend's girlfriend that she's spoiled?,"Several days ago we invited a friend and his girlfriend over for dinner. Before we start, some background about my friend: I've known him for almost 15 years, he never had a lot of money, but he never let that get in the way. He worked hard, saved hard, and bought things if he decided he really wanted them, but was not a spendthrift. He paid his way through university without taking any loans, working his ass off in two jobs while full time studying. He recently opened a startup of his own which has great potential and has started getting nibbles and several customers, but is far from being a success, or even profitable, yet.

On to the story - they were talking about how they were looking to buy a car (his first), because now that they lived together, she felt that they could split the cost of a car because they were saving money on rent. I could tell my friend wasn't too hot on the expense, because all his money was in the startup and he'd need to take out a loan to get a car, in addition to the loans he had already taken out to get his business up and running. When we were talking about it, his girlfriend kept saying things about how ""At 33 years old I shouldn't have to take the bus anymore"", and ""Taking public transportation is for losers"". As someone who bought my first car (used) at 31 because my family was growing, I'll admit I took some offense to that. I've used public transportation for years (and still do) and never considered it ""beneath me"".

The real kicker came when she started talking about getting a brand-new car, straight from the dealership. Wouldn't even consider getting something a coupla years old. Here's where I may have overstepped my bounds, and told her that her entire attitude is spoiled, and that if she really cared about my friend, she'd realize that he doesn't have the ability to spend that much money, and she should look at something cheaper if she wouldn't deign to ride the bus with the rest of the common folk. 

After a minute or so of awkwardness, the conversation switched to other topics and the subject of the car was dropped. After they left, my wife said I shouldn't have called her spoiled to her face and I almost ruined dinner for everyone. My friend told me, though, that she dropped the idea of the brand new car and they're looking at the user car lots.

TIFU deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.,"[THE UPDATE!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200B;

Ohhhhh where do I begin. This happened this weekend.

Let's lay out some plot points first..

\-I'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. She is 26.

\-I work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. I've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-I've always worked out, done yoga, I'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. This combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. I've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. I know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, I've done it a lot and I know what I'm doing, lol.

&#x200B;

OKAY. So, the girl I am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. One of whom is getting married soon. She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. I was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? I agree to the plan. I was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200B;

There are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. This way, I would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. But the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (I can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200B;

So the day comes, I have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. By the time I arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. I prepare myself with the girl I'm dating, and she invites her friends in. They are hooting and hollaring as I'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. The whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, I'm really into this idea now.

&#x200B;

I throw my legs over my head as I've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... I circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. I put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and I hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. I'm trying to look back to see them, but I'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. I start getting more and more into it, and the girl I'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. At this point I'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. The girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200B;

After a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""Cum in your mouth! Cum in your mouth!""... Now to be clear, I normally don't do this. I have before, lol, but it's not my thing. But I'm the entertainment, and I aim to please, so in my mind I'm thinking lets do this. I start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. The girl I'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. The whole thing is so hot and I feel like I'm about to cum, and.....explode. It was a lot. I'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. The girl I'm dating let's go of my legs and I fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. Her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - I'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. So I stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and I look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. My assistant.

&#x200B;

She leaves the room, I race to the bathroom. The girl I'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and I tell her. She loses it laughing - ""SO AND SO is your assistant?! AHAHAHAH"". I'm not laughing. Assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200B;

It's actually a bit of a scene, the girl I'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling Assistant and she is not answering. The girl I'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200B;

I've been working from home all week. I've talked to my assistant via Slack and we've said nothing. She is in the office. I can't work from home tomorrow. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. The girl I'm dating said that Assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. I really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200B;

tl:dr - I sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. We haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200B;

EDIT:  [The diagram](https://imgur.com/a/rR31eBi)!  I'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  I'm not a turkey, I promise.

EDIT 2: To clarify, I don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  I think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  The diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until I stood up.  At least this is the logic I am convincing myself of.

EDIT 3:  I'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl I am dating"" because honestly I wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  I don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

EDIT 4:  Yes, they were staring at my butthole.  I'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. To be honest if,

EDIT 5:

Since everyone is asking, I'll offer my thoughts.  No, I'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  It's my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

As for the ""I've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - I bring it back to the above statement.  A handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  But it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  Better than jerking off that's for sure.

And yes, I have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

I've never really seen eye-to-eye with my MIL because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... I understand that children need discipline, but I prefer a gentler approach with my son. I've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists I let it go, so I've tried to. 

Until now. My son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. She insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that I'm just babying him. I've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

She has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. I told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying I accused her of being an unfit grandmother. Which I admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

Now my husband wants me to apologise to her. He says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that I'm overreacting. I kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is OF THE ESSENCE because it happens so quickly. 

So, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

She's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a LOT of peanuts, everywhere. I asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

I'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a Mama's boy who thinks Mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. He says he turned out just fine being raised by her and I worry too much. 

Would it be awful if I insist she only see him if I'm present? Am I completely unreasonable and overreacting? Is there anything else I can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**EDIT/MINI-UPDATE**: First of all, woah. I did not expect this to get so much attention. Thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. In case you missed it: I'VE LEFT FOR NOW, removed my son from the situation, and I'm now currently staying at my brother's house. At least for a few days until things cool off and I'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. In the mean time, I've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). Unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. My husband has been to the same appointments I have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

Some people have accused me of being a helicopter Mom, or trying to demonize my MIL. And given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe I'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then I'm okay. I'm not even a SAHM, we have an incredible nanny while I work FT, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. In the past, I've tried my best for my MIL to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, I've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. But I'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

Lastly, I just want to say my MIL has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. She won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. So, I don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. She's very strong in her beliefs. I did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. My husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so I told him to find time or he won't be getting ANY time with my son until he does. If he's going to be so careless, I'll end up dealing with this legally. 

Thanks again everyone. Words can't express my gratitude. I will update with a new thread eventually.",relationship_advice
TIFU by putting a dildo in my gun case (NSFW),"This happened a couple weeks ago...

My aunt and sister-in-law came to visit my neck of the woods, but I'd just returned from a business trip and hadn't been home yet when we met up. They wanted to see my new apartment, so we headed over to my place. I went back to my bedroom to change out of the airplane clothes (I can't be the only one who does this, right?), and notice I'd left a purple vibrator on my bedside table (my husband had jokingly purchased the brightest, most obnoxious purple vibrating eggplant he could find, because we're apart a lot for work and he laughs at my affinity for purple). I went to put it away just as my sister in law walked into my bedroom. Having family see you holding a vibrating jelly stick strikes me as odd, so I ducked down and went for the first concealing item I saw: my pistol case. I quickly and snugly tucked the vibrator in the foam-lined case alongside my pistol, stuffed it under the bed and went on my merry way. No harm, no foul, no weird looks at Thanksgiving.

A few days later, I'm headed to the gun range for some target shooting. I grabbed my guns, some ammo, and headed out. It was such a quick and seemingly insignificant moment with the vibrator, I'd forgotten about stuffing it into the pistol case (the gun is purple, too, btw). I arranged everything on the table, and opened my gun case. In what seemed like slow motion, I opened the gun case -- the dildo, uncomfortably stuffed alongside the pistol, rolls out of the case, perfectly bumps something (the table, I assume?), starts vibrating, and comes to a rest on the floor. Past the table. This means, ladies and gents, that it's past the area you can go; there is a purple vibrating dildo lying amongst the spent brass shells. While I was in my own lane, there were 15-20 people in the other lanes. For the briefest moment, recognition seemed to fill the area as the gun range fell silent... 15 people watching the hapless dildo vibrate and twist it's way across the shooting range. Fortunately, it was only a couple feet past the table, so I grabbed the broom intended for sweeping shells, pulled it back under the table, turned it off, and threw it away. Looks like I have to find a new range now...  

TL;DR - in trying to hide a dildo, I put it in a gun case and proceeded to spill it onto a public gun range. ",tifu

I build my (26M) relationship on a lie and I dont know how to tell my gf (24F) or what to do," I met my gf on tinder and she had a picture with a dog so, of course, I commented on it as I broke the ice. We talked a bit and she turned out to LOVE dogs and I just said that yeah, dogs are great, because she seemed sweet and cute and I wanted a date.

Things progressed but we never met in her place because she had 2 roommates who acted like bunnies (if you know what I mean) so we usually would hang out at my place. I only really saw her dog when I was picking her up and I would never come in so I had no interaction with it.

Thing is she moved out to her own place last week. She now wants to hang out at her place. I would be very happy but her dog will be there too and...

I am really, REALLY afraid of dogs. I know I should've been honest from the get go but back then it seemed like such a small thing to lie about. I mean, how many tinder dates go beyond a hookup? And then the more time passed the more embarassed I felt. Especially since she would say that her dog breed gets so much bad rep by ignorant people and I just... how can I tell her I'm one of those people? Except I'm afraid of ALL dogs, not only hers so really it is worse?

How do I fix this? I don't want our relationship to end because I can't man up and just act like a normal person when I'm in a room with a friendly dog... I fucked up and I dont even know what to do here",relationship_advice

TIFU by putting a thong that was not my wife's in her underwear drawer,"This happened 2 days ago. So last week I found a thong on the floor in my living room. Smelt it like the animal I am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.

2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.

Huh... I found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? It was clean so I put it in your drawer. What it's not yours?

Angrily, she answers it's not hers. You just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?

I tell her what the hell am I suppose to say. She goes back upstairs really angry at me.

So last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. I send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. It is. We're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... We came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

Now the real fuck up. My wife is in the bed. I go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. Just texted her and the thong is hers. The only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

YOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE

Jesus Christ, I don't even believe my explanation myself. I tell her to believe what she wants, I don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that I don't have anything to redeem myself. I take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

The next morning she calls me. She tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that I'd put it in her drawer. And if I was cheating on her, I'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. Asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

TLDR : Found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. Almost lost my wife to it.

EDIT : OMG it exploded. Thanks for the silver mystery redditors! I know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! Had fun with the others that told similar stories :) And yes, I told my friend that I sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.

EDIT2 : The [thong](https://imgur.com/a/KtGzDeU) in question

EDIT 3 : Wow thanks for the gold! I answered to a bunch of you, but I'll not be able to keep up! There's too many comments! I hope you guys have a nice day!

EDIT4 : addressing some comments. No I don't think my friend did it on purpose to have my wife divorce me so she can have me all for herself. Yes I have the right to hang out with other women and have a drink with them. My wife also has the right to hang out with other men and have a drink with them.

I got a lot of DM's and I wasn't able to respond to everyone, but I did read your messages. However, I did not appreciate the many comments that simply insulted my wife, I know she fucked up and I'm still very angry at her, but I want to believe she can heal and become a better a person. 

Also, some of the DM's I got were extremely weird & hateful towards women in general, like stuff you see on the incel tears sub - y'all need more help than me and my wife. 

There were some common questions I wanted to address to provide additional clarification. 

* How did she avoid jail? 

I only mentioned the civil case since I felt it was the most appropriate to write about because I was originally angry about our financial situation. There was also a criminal case. Our lawyer thought she would originally have to go to jail for 3 months. However, we were able to get her punishment to be community service instead. She has A LOT of community service hours to fill within a year, she will also be getting visits from a PO. Laura and her husband did file restraining orders against her, I honestly can't blame them for that. It helped my wife that she had a clean record and has family that works in law enforcement. I want her to finish those community service hours first before we talk about her working more hours to help pay me back. 

* Why did she do this to Laura?

That is a good question. I asked her this multiple times over the past several months to try to understand what this woman did to my wife. She would tell me that Laura deserved everything horrible thing that my wife did to her, that Laura was a shitty person, a narcissist, a liar, and just overall a scumbag. But she never really gave specific examples. I've been pressing her for more info, and when she told me some specifics it made me feel sick to my stomach, not because of what Laura did but because how far my wife decided to go due to some petty things that happened in their friendship. Their friendship ended about 8-9 (they had been friends since early in high school) years ago and it was over a man they had both briefly dated. My wife dated ""Matt"" for a few months, she broke up with him because she thought that Matt had feelings for Laura. Laura said she didn't want to date Matt because he had dated my wife. My wife decided to ""test"" her friend Laura's loyalty, and told Laura she had her blessing to date Matt. Laura and Matt ended up dating for a few months, my wife stuck around while they were dating and once they broke up my wife told Laura that she had failed a loyalty test. They fought, and ultimately it was Laura who decided to end the friendship. (Note: In case it's not clear, Laura's current husband is NOT Matt.) 

Secondly, I was able to get some information from her about what inspired her to do this since their friendship had ended so long ago. My wife said she happened to see (by chance, not by stalking) Laura at a restaurant about ~1.5-2 years ago, and it looked like Laura had lost a lot of weight and was fit. My wife and I are both fairly overweight, and apparently Laura use to be overweight too. My wife admitted that she felt angry that Laura had lost a lot of weight while she had never been able to. My wife was also insulting Laura and said that she doesn't make a pretty thin person and that her new muscular body was too masculine. She also insulted Laura's husband's looks and physique as well. I saw both Laura and her husband in person on multiple occasions - they both look like normal, attractive people who obviously work out. (I could also tell my wife was irritated when she saw Laura at the courthouse the first time, and you could barely tell that Laura had even had baby.) My wife admitted that she just wanted to do some snooping to try to find that Laura wasn't doing well in life, she found the opposite and was jealous of Laura's success. She first found out both of their job titles (they both work at tech companies with some sort of engineering title) and their estimated salaries by using something called Glassdoor, and if that's accurate, then both Laura and her husband make really good money. She also saw a photo on facebook of Laura and her husband standing in front of what appeared to be their very beautiful and large home. She said she was angry because she knew that Laura wasn't deserving of any of this. She proceeded to insult Laura about how she's not that smart, not pretty, not responsible, she claimed that all Laura did through college was do drugs, drink, have sex with anything that had a penis, skip class and failed a lot, my wife said that she's the type who would cheat on her husband, that she's manipulative and is always up to something, etc. 

Both Laura and her husband seemed very sad and exhausted throughout the whole ordeal. I never picked up on anything sinister from Laura at all, I felt absolutely awful for her. I felt extreme shame and embarrassment whenever I was in the same room with Laura and her husband. I don't think I was ever able to make direct eye contact with either of them.  

So..yeah. I was expecting Laura to have done something truly evil or sinister in the past and that just wasn't the case. 

* Does she feel remorseful?

I want to say yes, she does. She has been really depressed since this all finalized. However, I can't help but think she's sad only because she got caught. She hasn't directly said anything that would lead me to believe she is truly remorseful. 

She's still angry at Laura for escalating to the point of a criminal and civil case, she feels that Laura overreacted. My wife believes every horrible thing she said about Laura. She's convinced that Laura is some kind of alcoholic/drug addict who cheats on her husband, and is the type to lie and cheat her way to the top of her career. And somehow Laura is able to hide this from everyone in her life. My wife felt like she was trying to ""expose"" Laura for the monster that she is. She feels that Laura pressing charges and suing her is additional proof that Laura is vindictive. 

My hope is that she has time to think while she is doing her community service hours over the next year. I think she feels bad that I had to empty out our accounts and sell some things to come up with the money. I talked to her about working more hours once she has finished community service, and she agreed. 

* Are you going to get divorced?

The thought has crossed my mind, but we've been together for so long and I still love her despite this disgusting thing she has done. I can't see my life without her. But, I know (and I'm having a hard time admitting this to myself) that if she doesn't improve or learn a lesson from this mess then I can't be with her anymore. A lot of people mentioned that if she can do this type of thing to an ex-friend, then she can do the same to an ex-husband. This has me worried some, I'd like to believe she wouldn't go nuclear on me if we did file for divorce. I'll be taking precautions in case I have to defend myself in the future. 


* Why is she only working part-time? 

She is a licensed masseuse and works at a really nice salon/spa. Her hourly wage is pretty high, but she hasn't been able to get the hours she wants at the spa she works at. She could probably get a more full time position at a different spa but with a slightly lower hourly wage, which would still bring in more income than what she is doing now. She really likes the place she is at and doesn't want to leave, but I may pressure her to full time work elsewhere to help pay me back and refill our emergency fund once she is done with community service. At the moment she is onboard with helping me put money back into our savings accounts. 

* What about therapy? 

I know we need this, both as a couple and as individuals to deal with this mess. I talked to her about this and she doesn't seem totally sold on the idea of therapy. I've expressed that I think it would help both us, and she seems indifferent at this point. I've talked to her parents, who are really angry/disappointed in her, they basically begged me not to leave her over this. I told her parents that I think therapy would help both of us, but I can't afford it now. They offered to pay for couples therapy, but that is as much as they would be able to afford, so it's a start. I know my wife will need individual therapy, and if that means I stop going to couples therapy so she can get the 1 on 1 help she needs, so be it. 


I'm not ready to call my wife a psychopath as many of the commenters did the last post. I think she got carried away, and thought she was trying to expose someone she truly believed was a bad person. I'm heavily leaning towards that she has had some sort of mental breakdown and focused all of her energy on this one woman and her life. I'm not going to give up on my wife yet. It's very possible that she has some underlying mental illness that could very well be treated with therapy or meds. 

* How much money was she sued for?

I don't want to give specific numbers, but it will take about 4-5 years to get back to where we were prior to this happening. If my wife takes on a full time after she is done with community service and hands over the majority of her paycheck, it may take less than 4 years.  

* Are kids involved?

No, we don't have kids and are not planning on having any. 


* What next? 

That's what I need help with. I've sat down with my wife a few times since the post and I can feel some resistance coming from her about starting couple therapy. I think she's irritated at her parents for offering to pay for therapy for us. She has stated that she would rather us solve our problems together without interference from someone she doesn't know. She's afraid she isn't going to like any therapist we find, and that the therapist will attack her throughout our sessions. I've tried explaining to her that the therapist isn't there to blame anyone, that they would try to help us and that it would be a safe space for her to talk and vent about whatever she needs. I've brought up the idea of therapy every night since the post, and each time she has had an excuse along the lines of - it won't help, the therapist will gang up on her, she isn't going to like the therapist/the therapist won't like her, or that we can solve our own problems at home. 

tl;dr : I answered a bunch of questions I wasn't able to get to before my first post was locked. But, I really need help pushing my wife to get therapy, she is resistant and isn't convinced it will help us.",relationship_advice

Making the bed is a pointless chore and a waste of time.,"Sure, it looks aesthetically pleasing, but the following night you're just going to mess it up again! The only time people should really be expected to make up their bed is when (for some reason) you're having company over that wants to check out your bedroom. And even then I would argue that it's ridiculous that society expects you to straighten the thing that you sleep in every night. 

There's nothing gained from it other than satisfaction, it's stupid.

Edit: First of all, thanks for the silvers. Second, I am ASTOUNDED by how many idiots are comparing making the bed to wiping your ass. I didn't think I would have to explain this, but due to the sheer number of these comments that I'm getting...

My wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary,"Tl;Dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. Brought flowers to wifes office. Found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

Yup. Tl;Dr  says it all. My (35m) wife (35f) and I were married ten years ago yesterday. She has been working on a big project for the last few months. The last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. This is a career maker for her.

 I work construction. With the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. So I work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. If its raining when I get up I dont go in. Somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. I usually hit the gym for an hour or two. Thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. We go home. I go to the gym as usual. I cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife Mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. We really havent seen much of each other this week. I went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. Not unusual for past month. 

I stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. Nichole was at the receptionist desk. I told her I got here later than I wanted could she put the flowers on Mehgans desk. She said ""I dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" She buzzed the door to get back to the offices. The place was deserted. I went to her office, the door was closed . I always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. I walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. She is giggling only as she can. Saying""we got to get this done"".  I am gut punched. I slammed the flowers down said ""Happy Anniversary"" and walked out. I didnt hear what she said just went past Nichole said goodbye and left. Made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

I balled my eyes out all the way home. Went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. I drove about 2 hours to a State Park. I had no idea what to do . I just had to run. I hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. I dont drink much so I had no booze, I just sat there thinking. Looking back I am glad I was in a rush, normally I bring a 45cal. With me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. The way I was feeling I might have ate the barrel that night. My phone was blowing up fom Mehgan so I had turned it off. I left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. I called him back. He said Meghan called him to check on me, make sure I didnt do anything stupid. We talked a bit, told him I got to think this thru, would catch up on Friday.

So while I am thinking about this, I go over our marriage from the beginning to see what I missed. We come from completely opposite backgrounds. My Grandfather raised me with my mom. He taught me about life. He had a little saying about everyhing. He told me marriage would be the hardest job ZI ever had, you had to work on it everyday. God I miss him. We did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. They worked hard and my brother and I did not miss out on anything we knew of.

Mehgan was born into money. Not overly rich but very comfortable. Went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. And she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. I would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  We met hit off started dating. I was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. We dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. Our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. Families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. Her dad and I started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

She graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. We work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. I took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. We agreed we had to experience the others interests. She was really enthused about the more physical things we did. I kinda like the symphony and such. I own two tuxes now.

I look back and do not see any red flags. Her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. She was paraded out in front for photo ops. Invited to conferences when other newbies were not. At dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. She quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . This 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. She seems very happy. We seemed very happy. 

So now, Friday, I am home. I called her. Asked where she was, back at work. I being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. She responded since I would not talk what was she to do? Fair enough. She will be home in an hour. So I wait. I want to save our marriage. If I am lacking in providing then I want to fix it. I want to ask why of course but I can not accept  a IDK answer. How do I phrase this? What else should I be asking? I know I will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  What she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. Thank you in advance.",relationship_advice

(Update) Bought a PS4 from Walmart for Christmas and it had books in it,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a98686/bought_a_ps4_from_walmart_box_had_books_in_it_and/

Ever since discovering right before Christmas that the PS4 Spiderman combo my wife purchased for our son had books in it and took it in to get a new one it's been an extremely annoying and stressful time.

I took the advice of everyone and called corporate, talked to corporate in their online chat, everyway possible and it's always the same a answer ""We stand behind the decisions of our salaried managers"".

Corporate literally does not care and shifts it to the ""salaried managers"" decision. So I've been back to the same Walmart 4 times to talk to them and the last time about 2 weeks ago they said they would call the cops. I wasn't yelling, or causing issues I just want the PS4 my wife purchased for our son for Christmas. 

So the last time they called the cops, they came and the manager says right in front of me ""I believe this man has been trying to scam us since Christmas Eve claiming his PS4 had books in the box"". Cop gets my story and says well there isn't enough to do anything against me, manager dislikes this that I've been constantly dealing with and I get permanently banned from the store (just that particular one, he can't ban me from all properties but said he will be calling corporate).

I again try to call corporate and nope, same exact replies that they stand behind their salaried managers decisions.

So the outcome? No PS4, no refund because it was purchased in cash and I cannot do a chargeback. If you are ever purchasing anything expensive from Walmart, open the box immediately after purchase and in front of an employee. Merry Christmas Walmart.

AITA for not taking pictures of my wife at our wedding?,"So we tied the knot and decided that after saying 'I do', 'Sarah' and I would each have our own digital camera to take any photos we wanted during the rest of the day to record our own personal memories, then put these in a section of our wedding photo album. It was her idea and I thought it would be fun. 

Fast forward to us getting these photos developed after the honeymoon. We look through them together for the first time- to summarise:

Her photos: Me in my suit, me with our God daughter, me with a few friends, me drunk at the after party. More of guests, decorations, the beaitiful cake but most of them are of me.

My photos: a seagull that was perched on the church, some guests, blurry lights, and many silly pictures of my groomsmen.

As soon as Sarah saw the pictures I had taken, she was clearly holding back tears, and not happy ones. I asked her what was wrong and she wouldn't tell me at first because she felt embarrassed, but after asking a few more times she admitted that she felt disappointed that I hadn't taken a single picture of her in her dress. I basically told her that I didn't really think to, as anyone who has been to a wedding knows that every camera is pointed to the bride. She replied that she wanted to see herself through my eyes on our wedding day. This conversation went round in circles until she just snapped at me that i found a seagull more noteworthy than my bride on our wedding, and now she's gone to bed angry. I feel like this conversation isn't over but as it's our first fight as a married couple, I need to know if I'm in the wrong.

So, am I the asshole here? I... feel like she's overreacting a little. I thought the cameras were intended to record whatever we felt like. I didn't know she'd expect me to take pictures of her.

**EDIT: Info: we did hire a photographer during the ceremony. The cameras were for after, she wanted candid pictures to make memories. I remember her saying she was okay with some being lighthearted. She prefers candid photos because they feel more natural and capture our own memories more**

**EDIT 2** I'm the asshole. And a clueless idiot. From now on I'm going to make up for it with all the candid photos possible, and have noted a few lovely little ideas from commenters. Thank you to all who have judged me, I accept my judgement",AmItheAsshole

[Update] My ex girlfriend committed suicide.. I am a firefighter and had to find her body,"Its been a bit over 6 months since I posted that story and I want to give you a quick update on my life. Im on mobile so I apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 TL;DR My ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. She was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. I am a firefighter in NJ, but go to school in NH. I received the call and conducted research to find her. I drove back down to help with the search. We found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


Where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. I was in a dark place for a while after that. I drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. For a good amount of time I distanced myself from any girl who I met.

The funeral wasnt long after and Jim didnt even show up. Im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


I didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. It felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. The depression i felt was destructive.

My chief reached out to me not long after because I never told him how I knew her. He asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. I was in NH so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

I lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. I had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

After 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. I met this really nice girl named Sarah. We talked  and even hooked up a couple times. After a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. I told her i couldnt. I told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. She took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. I felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. I didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

Fast forward another month my friend Kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. I accepted and thats when i met Kristen. Kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. We ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. I opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. She completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

She convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. So i made an appointment and went. The therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. I joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

I did my first story and Kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. It was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. I continued doing these events and Kristen went to every single one. 

After 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. She understood. Weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. Shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

Every time im in NJ i go to Lydias house and support her mom. On Christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

The way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. And if it wasnt for Kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.",relationship_advice
"mother in law suing my wife for ""grandparent rights""","So today in the mail we received a letter from the county court of where my mother in law lives and she is suing us for ""grandparent rights"" a little back story.

\*Courts based in upstate NY\*

Over the last almost 8 years me and my wife have been  together her parents always have despised me cause i was a punk city boy and my wife was a good country girl. We moved in after 6 months and have been happy together since. we got married back in 2015 so we are coming up on a 4 year anniversary and things got better for awhile until we bought our first house and i got a job where i started making a lot of money. me and my wife now live a very comfortable life nice cars house etc.

Back on thanksgiving of last year is when shit hit the fan. Her mother said some very hurtful stuff about me and my wife to my brother in laws girlfriend, my wife and her are very close so she tells her everything and once the beans were spilled my wife confronted her mother about it. Her mom made every excuse under the sun instead of just saying sorry she was wrong (we know she said it because there was text proof). We haven't talked to her only once or twice since thanksgiving.

Today we received a letter in the mail from her county court suing for grandparent rights everything i have read they can only sue if we are ""unfit"" to be parents. My wife and i don't have any alcohol, drug problems, or trouble with the law we have been happily married for almost 4 years and our kids are well taken care of no debt etc. We also never once stated ever she could not see the children not verbally or over text. We just sold our house yesterday expected close is early May and then we are moving to South Carolina this has been a plan for years and we finally acted on it back in December.

Does she have any ground to stand on? Does NY have any laws to that effect where they could force us to give them the kids for visitation? Can this stop our move from happening and screw up the sale of my house? Any advice is much appreciated.

[UPDATE]I (14m) have no connection with my mother(29f). My mom was raped. I don't know how to handle this.,"I posted yesterday about my issue with my mom. I finally had the courage to talk to my mom about our relationship and I wasn't prepared for it.

We were alone and I just asked if she loved me. I called her mom for first time in months. I wanted to know what her feelings for me really are. I just ranted to her without letting her speak. How I needed her attention and it's affecting me. I played sports just for her attention and so that she would be proud of my achievements. I asked her why she wouldn't attend my awards ceremonies or attend parents nights at school. I would stay out late just so that she would call me. I flipped and told her she should have never had me. I fucked up.

I made my mom cry that night.

She told me that she did love me. 

She revealed that she was raped by my dad. He was her boyfriend at the time but she didn't consent. She became depressed and carried me full term. She is still recovering from her depression. My grandparents wanted her and I to be raised as siblings, in order for her to continue with her life. At first she tried to be a mother but it was really difficult raising me. This is why she has been distant from me. She doesn't know if she wants to be my mom or act as my sister. In the end she just gave up. I remind her of her rapist but she knows that I am gentle and kind. I didn't know what to say, I just hugged her. It was a hard truth to swallow. I told her that I will always be there for her. She told she didn't know I was hurting inside. I told her we can start again from scratch.

My mom joked that I scare away her boyfriends and she loves my cooking. I cried as I went to sleep. I can't blame her anymore and I should make a better effort to be more involved with her. I want to support her. I'm not going to break off contact with her. I going to try and persuade her to join me in getting some family therapy. 

I'll try my best to be a good son. Thanks for the advice.

I wanted to ask if there was any advice on helping family members overcome depression.

Edit: Thank you for all the support. I will get my grandparents involved to search for a good therapist for my mom and myself.

Just found out my boyfriend was an incel ‚Äî reposted from AITA,"(Deleted from AITA so reposting here.)

I met my boyfriend through a local DnD Facebook page. We started talking every day over Messenger and pretty soon we were meeting up to continue our conversations in person. We had a lot of stuff in common, and I thought he was really funny, and I just enjoyed his company. We started dating and we've been dating for nearly a year. We moved in together in May.

However, yesterday I found out from one of our DnD friends that he used to comment on r/Braincels . He brought it up in a ""good for him for moving on"" way but holy fuck. I only knew about incels from the guy that killed all those people a few years back. I managed to get the friend to tell me the account name (he got really uncomfortable and asked me not to tell my boyfriend) and although he never said anything violent, my boyfriend repeatedly called girls derogatory names, said we were inferior, we were whores, we would never date a short ugly man like him, etc. His last post he mentioned that he was talking to a ""foid"" and that she was actually showing interest. I think he meant me.

He was going through a really hard time this past year, not in a good mental place, but I don't think that excuses all the sexist and gross things he said about women. He's never shown any misogyny towards me or anyone else, but how do I know he doesn't still feel that way? Would I be the asshole for dumping him over something that happened pre-our relationship? Should I give him a chance to explain? I love him and I don't know if I can be objective if he asks me to sympathize with him. But I also don't think I can continue to be with him knowing he things I'm not deserving of the same respect as men.

Added info from last post: he's never done anything I consider a red flag, but I also have been blind to warning signs in past relationships, and he never told me about his misogynistic history. I feel like my trust has been breached.

UPDATE: WIBTA If I cancelled our wedding?,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/cuvkw3/wibta_if_i_cancelled_our_wedding/

TLDR at the bottom! 

Hello, all! It's been some time since I laid out all the bullshit my fiance and I were dealing with in regards to planning our wedding and such. We were so overwhelmed with the immense response and support, so, thank you to everyone who contributed and offered advice. Now, on to what happened! 

My fiance and I talked it through, the pros and cons, etc. We both realized how unhappy we were with how things were going and decided that we were going to cancel the wedding and move forward with eloping. We decided that we didn't want it to be just us, but a small group of family and friends as well. We were both ecstatic, but, also EXTREMELY worried at how our parents were going to take it. Especially considering our guest list went from over 120 people, to 20. But, we were both committed and he decided to tell his parents and I would then tell mine. 

Surprisingly, his parents were SO supportive and extremely ecstatic that we were getting eloped. They were even more excited when we let them know we wanted them there and they booked their flight soon after! They also handled telling their families and friends in Texas that we were eloping and to get over it. So, that saved us the trouble! His other family was very supportive and wished us the best. My father also was incredibly supportive and couldn't wait to be there. My mother on the hand, was FURIOUS.

The phone call to her started off calmly enough and I did let her know before beginning the conversation that she most likely wouldn't enjoy this. But, I pressed forward. I told her our reasons, our stresses, how we felt disrespected and disregarding concerning everything, I laid it all out in a calm and collected manner. Once finished, she was very quite and simply said, alright. I knew immediately that I was pretty well fucked, but, we ended the phone call with her stating she understood. 

Less than 24 hours later, she texts me asking if my brother (whom one of our biggest stressors was about) was invited. I was pissed because I had just had this conversation with her and explicitly told her who was invited and etc. I responded back with a simple no and that my father, grandmother and herself were invited. Well, shit hit the fan.

She sent me a wall of texts, calling me all sorts of names, throwing my fiance's family in my face and how we took their side, how I never truly gave a shit about her feelings, all the good stuff. I remained calm and before sending each response, consulted my fiance as to not sound like a total bitch. Long story short, she said unless my brother is invited, she won't be coming. So, I told her not to come. I was over it and stopped responding to her texts. 

For days she texted me, saying all the same as before and kept asking if my brother was invited. I responded once and told her that until she apologized (she won't) that I wouldn't be seeing or speaking to her about anything regarding the wedding. I offered an open seat to our wedding, whether she shows or not, is completely up to her. 

My fiance and I have already booked a small venue for our elopment and are more excited planning this than our previous wedding and are looking forward to our future! 

TLDR: We are eloping, bitches!

TIFU by telling a girl on a first date that i work with deaf children and know sign language," 

So first of all i'll start off with a little context‚Ä¶ I don't usually do formal first dates, especially when its with somebody i barely even know. However, i've just come back to University for my final year of studying and i met up with my old flat mate from last year. She had already moved into her new flat and met all of her new flat mates, one of which happened to be a very attractive girl who we will call Stacey. Now my old flat mate was always trying to set me up on dates last year at University, but i always had an excuse. Now with it being a new year i thought ill have a fresh start and really knuckle down and stop going out all the time (i said exactly the same after my 1st year) and focus on my Uni work and look for a serious relationship instead of having flings. 

So i get shown a few pictures of Stacey and my old flat mate is telling me how nice she seems and how great she is and honestly i just thought why not, i may as well, what harm could going on a date possibly bring about? So she gives me Staceys number and we start to text and chat for a couple of weeks and we seem to be getting along really well. So much so that i suggest we should go for some food one evening to meet in person and get to know one another a little better. Now bearing in mind i never ever do this, i usually just speak to girls on nights out when i'm filled to the brim with liquid confidence and i'm usually so drunk that my confidence is through the roof. However i feel myself really starting to like this girl, i've never really been one for texting but our conversation seemed to flow naturally.

So i meet Stacey at this very busy restaurant last week, i'm full of nerves but i'm ready for the date. We get sat down and we begin chatting away and things seem to be going really well. Im still nervous but after a few pints the nerves start to settle and i get a bit carried away telling my stories and my somewhat crude jokes. At the best of times i'm a very loud person, however, after a few beers i turn into a human fog horn and unbeknownst to me, i'm speaking at a level high enough for the whole room to hear. I know this because all of my friends love to remind me how loud i am when we're on a night out. Now here comes the fuck up. 

So being full of my favourite ale and with the nerves starting to settle, i'm growing louder and louder by the minute. So much so that Stacey, very politely i must say, lets me know that i need to turn the volume down just a tad (especially when telling my alcohol fuelled jokes). Now i'm not an angry person by any means, but i can't begin to count the amount of times I've been told to quieten down when drunk, and for some reason i decided this night was the night where i'd have enough. So instead of apologising like any normal person would, drunk me decided it would be a good idea to try and turn it back on Stacey. I don't know what come over me but the only excuse i could muster was ""Well i do apologise but, you see, i volunteer working with deaf children so i'm used to having to speak really loudly, i've actually just come from there before our date"". 

Now if you knew me you would realise how ridiculous this sounds. Once i told my friends and my old flat mate about what i had said they were falling to the floor with laughter. So far it doesn't seem that bad, until Stacey says something along the lines of ""wow, i'm really sorry, that is great, you must know sign language then?"". Drunk me thinking i'd got one up on her proceeded to nod and claim that i do in fact know sign language, i think i even threw up a few fake hand signs which probably looked more like gang signs to cover my tracks. However, what i didn't expect was for Stacey to have a younger deaf brother who would apparently LOVE to meet me as she's never dated a guy before who can do sign language!

Honestly my heart sank, she was sat across the table from me signing something to me and god knows what she was saying. I just smiled and nodded and to this day i still don't know what she was saying but my unenthusiastic smile and nod seemed to work. I quickly moved the conversation along and got swiftly off the subject. So now Stacey thinks i know sign language and what's even better is that she can't wait for me to meet her younger brother who would be so excited to be able to sign with a guy she's dating!

Ive tried Youtube videos but all i've managed to pick up on is being able to say vowels and ask someones name. I don't have the balls to tell her and i really don't know what to do. Im seeing her again next week and i know i need to tell her the truth, she seems the sort of person who would just laugh it off but she seemed so happy when i told her and she's even suggesting we Face Time her brother when we're next together so i can have a conversation with him. I just feel like a dick now and i don't want to let her down or upset her younger brother, but i don't think asking him his name over and over is going to cut it. 

TL;DR Im a loud idiot when i've had a drink and instead of apologising about being such on a first date with a girl, i tried to cover it up by claiming i work with deaf children and know sign language. Turned out she has a younger deaf brother who she now wants me to meet and speak to using sign language. I don't have the first clue about how to sign and i don't have the balls to tell her the truth because i don't want hurt her or her brothers feelings.

Edit

WOW i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did, i've just woke up now and had a chance to read through all of your comments, thank you for the platinum and what not, I just want to clear up a few things i've read. 

thanks for all your concern regarding me possibly be a high functioning douche bag alcoholic. first of all when i say really loud, i'm not a boisterous loud, all attention to my please sort of loud, i just speak really loud when i'm drunk enough for other people to hear, it's because i get overly excited and it was a mix of that and the nerves which made me start talking over excitedly and get carried away with the volume. 
also i've seen a few comments about the lying. i know it wasn't right but that's why i tried to stress i never do anything like this, me and in person first dates just don't mix. My nerves just got the better of me and i'm an anxious person at the best of times, i knew right away that coming clean would have been the best thing to do but i'm so awkward that i just didn't know what to say or do and i just wanted to move on the conversation as quickly as possible. I said it in the first place intending it to be a light hearted joke (clearly i'm not funny), i wasn't actually going to roll with the lie that i work with deaf kids. However the last thing i expected was for her to come back with that and it just completely threw me off. I'm seeing her again next weekend so i'll be sure to update you all on how this turns out, thank you for all the advice and the genuine concern a lot of you have, and especially to all of you who have helped me see the funnier side of this situation.",tifu

WIBTA for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?,"Dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but I'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

We've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural Midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. This year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and I jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. We learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, I adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

None of this has been a problem for me until recently. She saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then I rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. She exploded in anger (teen years, I'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, I know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was HER pan for vegan food. I was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not YOUR pan. 

She asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. I didn't want her to feel weird about food, so I said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. The reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that I'm not to touch them unless I'm cooking vegan. 

That wasn't good enough. Now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because I eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. I don't mean I literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because I wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly I'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. My wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. My daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick. Now I'm sorry for her, but I feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because I'm not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",AmItheAsshole
Thanking God for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.,"I'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but I've seen enough posts and comments online. I've had enough.

I have nothing against religion. You can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. However, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

I've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""God is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

No. I don't care how real you think he is, God had nothing to do with that. Those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not God - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. God did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. God did not come down from the heavens. God did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. God did not do that surgery. *They did*. And saying that God did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. It completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *Especially* if that person is not religious.

Sure. You can call it a miracle or God's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. God didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. It doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

But to say that God did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. It's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. You're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. It's just wrong.

**Small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: I recognize that starting this off with ""I have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. But I don't have anything against religion as a whole; I have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. It's a simple matter of a lack of respect. Additionally, I don't mean the common ""thank God!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. What I mean is the active, continuous thanking of God versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking God and not those involved, or simply making God the main focus of the gratitude). Also, I gotta be that person as I don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ‚ô™siiilver and gooold‚ô™!!",unpopularopinion
TIFU by thinking divorce was an April Fools Gag,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

My borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I'm no april fool.

TIFU by making my boyfriend a tinder account,"Okay so necessary this actually happened in the last couple of weeks. Basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. 

Obviously I think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though I've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. So, for some stupid reason, I decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. I set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

After a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after I showed this to him, I saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

Queue my surprise when a couple of days later I check the tinder account I had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and I could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

I confronted him and he denied it but I mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. Obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity I checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. So now the tinder I made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

TL;DR: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

Edit: Wow I did not expect this to blow up! Thank you so much for the gold and silver and for your kind, kind words. It honestly touches me how absolutely lovely thousands of strangers can be.

Neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive,"Male, late 20's, CO

I quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (I haven't consumed alcohol in years) and I replaced that habit with drinking Martinelli's Sparkling Apple Juice. The juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to Corona beer bottles. 
Here lies my issue:
This morning I was walking to my car from my apartment and I had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. My neighbors basically jumped me from behind. One grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. He was saying stuff like ""The nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" As a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and I think my nose is fractured. Most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that I was not about drink and drive, but that I WAS DRINKING APPLE JUICE. This all just happened. I'm calling the cops. Any suggestions?

BTW, I didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. They said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

UPDATE:

The police showed up. As soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

UPDATE #2:

Both men were arrested and I will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. I will be talking to detectives. The police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ",legaladvice

TIFU by ruining a happy family.,"Like all good TIFUs, this didn't happen yesterday.

My wife and I went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  It's just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  Whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.

One of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  From our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  I assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.

On this particular evening, my wife and I were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  I thought it would be fun to pull up YouTube and make duck noises.  I found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so I started playing it.  Lo and behold, the ducks responded.  At first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  They ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  It was a pretty fun experience.  That is, until it got out of hand.

Apparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  This other drake had no interest in me, however.  He immediately went for the hen.  This led to a fight between the two drakes.  They started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  Unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.

My wife and I stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  She still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and I suppose that's fair.

I'm not really super torn up about it.  In fact, I find the whole situation kind of amusing.  I thought this more light-hearted TIFU belonged here.

TL;DR:  Went to dinner and played duck calls.  Called in another drake and ruined a family.

My family is abusive and I want to emancipate myself,"I'm a 16 year old girl. I live with my aunt and uncle and cousins. My maternal grandfather also stays with us. My parents passed away in a car accident two years ago - I was in the car but I survived - and I was taken in by my maternal aunt. My dad grew up an orphan so there is no family on his side.

The last two years have been hell for me. Not only because I still can't get over losing my parents (I cry a lot) but also because the situation with my aunt and her family has been an awful experience. My mom was actually estranged from her family. She was white, and my dad was black. Her family never approved - they disowned her when she decided to marry my dad. They have never really ""forgiven"" my mom and I guess I'm a walking and talking representation of her ""mistake."" 

They have told me just that on several occasions. That my existence is a mistake. I get called ""halfbreed"" and other racist stuff. And I'm constantly on the receiving end of verbal abuse. Sometimes it gets physical. Sometimes it feels like I'm trapped in a minefield. I have to be so careful about where I step cause the repercussions may be explosive. My ""uncle"" has also made inappropriate sexual advances towards me. He has groped me before and disguised it as ""being sloppy with his movements."" 

I can't live like this anymore. I'm an absolute emotional mess. I wanna emancipate myself but I don't know how to go about it. I know the odds of getting emancipation rely a lot on the minor being able to show they can be financially independent.

 I'm close with a set of twins at school - I'm dating the boy and the girl is my best friend. Their parents own a farm and I work regularly with the family. I'm also into photography and I've been doing real good with shooting weddings. They are very lucrative and I've saved up a substantial amount. With summer at an end and winter coming up, not so many weddings anymore but I also do like family shoots and other portraits; that also supplements my income.

The parents of my boyfriend and my best friend know my situation and they said they can offer me lodging as an employee. I've also recorded my family being emotionally abusive towards me. I don't know if that is enough to get me emancipated.

I would really appreciate advice.

Thank you

"My longer term boyfriend [M25] told me that I [F22] was not completely satisfying him in bed. He asked for an open relationship and now he has a FWB, but he's upset with me now for recently finding one as well.","My boyfriend and I have been together for over 5 years and a couple of months ago he told me he felt like he wasn't completely satisfied in the bedroom. I was pretty hurt by this but I can understand it because my libido has been very low due to the stress of my job. I asked him if he was just interested in trying something new and that's when he proposed the idea of an open relationship. This really hurt my feelings, but I didn't say no because I wanted to please him. I told him okay, but that I didn't want to hear about the sexual exchanges he was about to have. We agreed to keep things to ourselves if we got involved with anyone. 

He has a FWB relationship with a girl he met on an app now. He told me that without going into detail about their relationship and I kind of just acted like she didn't exist until recently. Recently I met up with a guy I used to go to school with and we went out for drinks to catch up. We ended up hooking up that night and since then we've continued having sex. He's introduced me to new things and I really enjoy the sex honestly, it's better than the sex I've been having with my boyfriend. 

I still love my boyfriend but the reaction he gave me upon finding out about my sexual relationship with a guy from college has me kind of upset and angry with him. He asked me if I had been seeing anyone else sexually and I told him yes without giving any details. He **begged** me to tell him what my FWB does to me and how exactly I please my FWB in bed. I told him I wasn't going into detail because that was what we had agreed on. He asked me if the sex was better than our sex. I told him honestly, but without detail, that I enjoyed sex with my FWB more because we had been trying new things.

He basically blew up on me and told me I'm not allowed to have a FWB. I said to him, ""well you have one!"" and he responded to me with ""this isn't about me, this is about you being a slut."" Truly unbelievable. 

What the hell do I do in this kind of situation? Is it just me, or is he being unfair?

EDIT : people seem to be confused here. As I stated in a previous comment, my sex drive was low for a while but after a few months of him being with another woman, it started to pick up again. And every time I wanted to have sex with him, he would push me away because he was ""too tired from already have sex"" (with his fwb) or he would engage but he would half ass it even when i was really into it. 

if you're gonna post a judgmental rude comment about how i'm ""lying"" about my low libido and how I hurt my boyfriend by having sex with someone else, then fuck off. He spent months having sex with another girl and I had no choice but to reach out to someone else for satisfaction. HE STOPPED HAVING SEX WITH ME. EVEN WHEN I WANTED IT.",relationship_advice

"UPDATE: Old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues I'm having."" Found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (MN)","[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

**Old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that I was having a ton of issues. I found out my therapist is her husband, but I didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200B;

**New developments summary**: There's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. I even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200B;

**New developments, continued**: Therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). I have a very peculiar family dynamic, so I think he talked about that. However, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. Unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that I was depressed and had family issues. Neat. One of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. Understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200B;

**Resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than I thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. Therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. I don't know if he'll practice again.

"I got pregnant at 16, my parents disowned me and tried taking custody of my daughter. After 10 years my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and both want to reconnect with me and get to know their grandchild. I need help on how to handle this.","
I am very sorry if this is convoluted and riddled with grammar and spelling mistakes.

At 16 I slep with my good friend Jared . The condom broke and my daughter was created. My parents 
, who were great until this point, didn't like that and wanted me to get an abortion. I couldn't bring it over myself to. I wanted to keep the baby. Ofcourse my parents told me to pack my stuff and leave the house and their life's. So I did. I went to my friends house and his parents took me in. They weren't thrilled but they said that we all had to help as a new family member was in the making.

In that time my friend and I started to develop feelings for each other.

I had my daughter and about 2 moths later Jared's  brother  came back into their life's. He was a recovering Heroin addict. As we had the baby, my mother in law told him he could not stay with us.
Eventually they let him stay more and more and he was spending nights until he had a relapse and stole a bunch of stuff. My parents got wind of that. They dug up a bunch of stuff and found out that my MIL also fought addiction after an accident she had 15 years ago left her addicted to pain mends.

So they called cps on us and a whole ass investigation was opened. It was a dark time I thought they were going to take my baby. In the end they didn't find anything substantial.

But them calling cps on me transformed into a tradition over the years. As it was a small town every mistake I made got back to my parents.

I was half an hour late to pick up due to my job? Cps charges because neglect.
I was out after 10 pm with my toddler(this happened twice because we went to family gatherings) . Cps.

Christmas loads of people stayed at Jared's house because it was a big family. Cps because many strange men were there.

They eventually stopped it because they were fined for calling them on me unnecessarily. If they had done it more I think it could have been an offence.

The last call was 5 years ago.

Eventually Jared and I married when we were 23 and we are quite happy. We worked retail jobs and studied. It took us longer than average to graduate but we did. With a lot of help of his parents. Jared is now an engineer and I work as a graphic designer.

We were able to afford a big flat and finally moved out of his parent's house. Our life's look normal now.

Anyway a week ago I get a call fromy mother who told me my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer and that his ultimate wish is to see me and my daughter again.

I don't really know what to do. Because while they didn't have to take care of my while I was pregnant I wished they had at least supported me. And while I get that they were panicking because they thought I was going to be an unfit mother, they made my life hell for 5 years.",relationship_advice

"META: Too many AITA commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.","I've become frustrated with how quick a lot of AITA commenters are to encourage OP's to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. While leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

When we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for Love, Empathy, Understanding, and Communication. These capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

Encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our ""throw-away"" consumer society. I often get a feeling that many commenters don't have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

Please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",AmItheAsshole

I slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him - [update],"Hey! A week ago I posted about the fact that I slept with my roommate within an hour of meeting him and I wasn't sure where to go from there. I was surprised at how much attention it got and thank you for all your comments! I think I was a little too excited and you brought me back down to earth. 

The following few days neither of us were home much so we only saw each other briefly, but we were friendly. On Thursday he knocked on my door in the evening and asked if we could talk. I was so nervous I thought he was gonna say he had a gf lol but he was actually really good, he addressed everything straight away and made me feel so comfortable. He said that he's sorry he wasn't around much the days after but I was like no it's fine I haven't been home either, I knew it wasn't on purpose. The vibe between us has never been awkward or anything. 

Anyway he said that he was surprised at himself at what happened but that he really enjoyed it and he got a really good feeling from me, and then he laughed and he was real cute and he said 'like maybe you have a good soul if that's a thing' and put his hand on mine and he was kidding but it was cute. And then he stopped and he said he really wanted to know how I felt and he said 'sorry I'm not trying to make this a big thing I just want to make sure you're okay with everything and I want to make sure you feel respected'. I was kind of blown away by how sweet he was about it. I said that I was fine and that I felt the same as him, like shocked but happy but not wanting to make it a huge thing. He said he is really attracted to me but his main concern is making sure we're both happy living together whatever happens. I said I agreed and then we just carried on talking and it just dissolved into talking about nothing but for about 5 hours. Then it was really late and he said he should go to bed, and he kissed my hand jokingly before he left. 

It was all really sweet and nice and I think that whatever happens, he's a respectful guy and we'll communicate and we'll be mindful of each other. At one point while we were talking he did say 'sorry we've gotten off track, but I felt it was important we didn't just discuss what happened, I wanted to get to know you a bit. It was a spontaneous thing so I'm glad you agree that we shouldn't make a big deal out of it, and there's no point discussing hypotheticals or getting caught up in worry. We'll be good to each other and treat each other like humans and that's all we can do. And maybe we'll have sex again too if you're also up for that.'

TIFU by having the FBI pull me out of class,"Obligatory *""this happened a few months ago.""*

This was easily the most stressful roller-coaster of an event that I hope I ever experience. 

The scene is freshman year of college. I'm a wide-eyed innocent student having a great time away from his parents. I've made some good friends and enjoy messing with them. As such, I decide to pull a little prank on them. It starts with a simple idea: I'm going to Ohio on a business trip. I was actually going to lunch with my parents, but this was a more fun story. I hadn't initially thought out this entire prank, but just like high school presentations, I decided to wing it. Every so often I would go on these out-of-state ""business"" trips, but I stayed vague as to what my business was. I told them that it was somewhat illegal, but in more of a gray area.

My friends were incredibly intrigued by my illicit endeavors, and as time went on, they began to ask more questions about this business. I still had little to no plan for this ordeal, but boy did I milk it. I had them convinced that there were overseas bank accounts with millions of dollars in them and that I had several people involved in this business. At one point I told them the story of how one of my employees got caught trespassing on government property and I had to pay $10,000 to bail him out. I would ""accidentally"" send a picture of several thousand dollars, claiming it was meant to go to someone else with no other explanation.

This went on for several months up until about April. The semester was coming to a close, and I had to figure out a finale for my little project. My roommates were in on my prank and several iterations of plans were discussed. The final version of this ~~bad idea~~ plan was as follows: I will create an email address posing as the chief of police at my college. In the email, the officer (we'll call him Bill Myers) will inform my friends that he is currently looking to bring in ShortTail359 for questioning. I was very specific to say that no one should call 911 or contact anybody outside of this email address with the excuse that there was no official investigation so Bill was looking into the matter himself. I then went on to explain how ShortTail359 is conducting a business out of university housing and that this is all we know but the business might be illegal/dangerous. In summation: email me if you know of ShortTail359's whereabouts, don't call 911, don't contact anyone else in the police department.

I figured I covered my bases and sent the email. It was very well worded and quite convincing to a group of people who already believed I was running a secret business. Sure enough, my friends bought it hook line and sinker. One of them replied, informing Bill that she didn't know anything about my business, other than that I mentioned it occasionally. Three friends ignored the email altogether, and one texted me saying she didn't believe it.

The next three days were interesting. I had several classes with these people and finals were upon us so skipping class was not a good idea, but I had to make them believe I was on the run. Fortunately some of these classes had several hundred students and I was able to sit far away from our usual spots. The smaller classes I avoided altogether. Meals were eaten at odd times, and at one point I had to hide in the shower because a friend was in my dorm. I had no contact with the prank-ees outside the occasional text.

Fast forward to the Thursday I decided would be the day to reveal my shenanigans. I'm walking into class when these two men in suits stop me just inside the door. They ask me if I am ShortTail359 and upon confirming this they tell me they need to speak with me outside. We walk downstairs to the building's lobby where I am greeted by two more men who have guns at their sides. All four of them hold up their badges in dramatic fashion and one introduces himself as ""Agent Michael Scarn with the FBI"" (fake name obviously). It was approximately at this point that I peed a little bit as I realized that I was in some trouble.

Agent Scarn: ""Do you know why we're here?""

ShortTail359: ""No, but I have a pretty good guess.""

Agent Scarn: ""Well why don't you tell us what your guess is?""

I proceeded to explain the email I sent out along with a brief summary of the genesis of my prank. 50 minutes of questioning later and I had given Agent Scarn the password to the email account, signed an agreement saying I won't access the account or I'd face several charges, given a written statement of the events, crapped my pants twice, and completely missed my class. Agent Scarn gave me his business card and said they would be in touch.

I go back to my dorm and try to come to terms with the fact that I may have ruined my future career and life altogether. All my friends had a good laugh at my expense but not before I had a good laugh at their expense for believing my stupid business story. After a long sleepless weekend I get a call from a Sergeant at the police station. He says that he needs to meet with me and we arrange a time. I go down to the station and for 10 minutes all he does is yell at me and tell me what a stupid idea this was. Now I'm a pretty good kid. Never got in trouble in school, honor roll, never so much as a speeding ticket, so having a police officer yell at me was a new experience. He finally calms down enough for me to explain that this is an anomale and that it was supposed to be an innocent prank. He believes me and tells me that regardless, they're going to charge me with criminal impersonation which is a class A misdemeanor. My court date is set for a couple weeks from now and that was the end of it.

I go to court fully prepared to leave with a no longer perfect record. As the staff is processing me and taking my mugshot, a lady asks me what my name is. I tell her ShortTail359, when a guy jumps around the corner and yells ""But you can just call him Chief Bill Myers!"" This was a much needed laugh and also informed me that word of my idiocy had gotten around town. I go into the court room and waited for this lighthearted judge to call my name. Most of the charges were speeding tickets or marijuana related so the judge was moving pretty quickly. However, he calls my name and then pauses. I walk up to the podium and he's still paused, clearly reading over my file. He looks up at me, and then back down at my file again. After reading it completely through, he just starts laughing. Several minutes go by before he finally asks me if I have any sort of criminal history. I tell him I don't have so much as a speeding ticket and he asks if I would like to keep it that way. I happily say yes and he give the DA my paperwork. The DA asks for my story and tells me that he's never seen anything like this before (something I had heard several times at this point). He informs me that this is something they could have expunged as long as I pay my court fees. I thank him and go back to waiting for the judge to call me up again.

When he does, a smile immediately dawns his face and he begins to chuckle. At this point I'm relieved enough to let out a giggle of my own since I can feel the entire court room wondering what I've done. The judge tells me that he will expunge my charge and asks me if I will ever do something like this again. I assure him that I will not and he says, with a smile on his face, ""You know son everyone in this court room is wondering who you impersonated, but I'm going to do something that you should have done and keep my mouth shut."" I thank him and sheepishly walk out of the room.

Later that day I took the required documents back to the court and had the whole charge expunged in a matter of hours. It was easily the most stressful month of my life and was not worth it at all, but I am now able to walk around with an FBI agent's card in my wallet and keep a fond memory of being laughed at by a judge.

TL;DR: I play a prank on my friends that ends with me being questioned by 4 FBI agents for almost an hour and charged with criminal impersonation.

TIFU by realizing my History teachers gave me a horribly skewed version of what happened leading up to the Civil War.,"I had 4 years of ROTC in high school and 2 Semesters of American History. (2 separate teachers) So, not a history major, but I have absorbed a lot of material on the Civil War. And I realized today that it was horseshit and I got hoodwinked.

Before that, like most people, when someone asked me why the Civil War happened, my answer would have been ""slavery"". And that definitely was an issue. But my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. They gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the North, what Europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --There was a lot. And it made sense, because I found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. So they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. Again, super plausible. This was all being presented with an attitude of ""Now let me tell you what REALLY happened"". 

Im SIX semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the Declarations of Secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. I had no idea they existed. I read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. They were ALL about slavery and how it was ""the greatest institution ever conceived"" and that it had to be protected. There's no way this wasn't THE forefront issue, after reading those papers. I messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn't remembering wrong and, I wasn't. I told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the Secession declarations either. Ugh.

Reddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong I was. I don't care about people calling me dumb, I'll own that. I just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and I got this...propaganda. I am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. I hope my stupidity is isolated, but I wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don't? 

TL;DR I thought the Civil War was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn't, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck.

EDIT: The FU part of this is that it took me making an ignorant post on a other forum and getting blasted by the Reddit community about how completely stupid I was for me to learn about the documents, or the Cornerstone speech. Which I guess is fair, I dunno. It hurt my feelings, but it shook loose the truth for me.

[Update] Overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

So I read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, I was doubting if I made the right decesion. I wasn't going to update because I didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days I came to a final conclusion.I want to clarify that I broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

After I broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. She would send me letters and call me a lot. In one of the texts I actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. Without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. I was about to agree, but something she said made me realize I would be making a mistake if I did. She said, ""I'll remember to respect from now on."" That sentence made me realize that I made the right choice by breaking up. Since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

Either way I'm glad I didn't give her a second chance. I don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

On a sidenote, the other day I was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and I guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that I moved on to fast. Blocked her and had a laugh I know for a fact I made the right choice.",relationship_advice

TIFU by taking a bath with my girlfriend,"Obligatory this happened two months ago

My girlfriend and I were sick and congested.  We were sitting on the couch and she said she was going to take a bath and put in eucalyptus oil and peppermint oil.  

She then asked me if I wanted to join.  Sure, laying in a hot bath sounded really nice.  She went downstairs to grab our towels and I started the bath.  As I put the oils in, I yelled asking how much I should put in.  I got the answer of only a little bit. 

Apparently our definitions of a little bit are different.  I don't know if you know how strong peppermint oil is, but i should be able to paint a picture.

As we climbed in the hot bath, I realized that my asshole was starting to feel like an ice cube was getting shoved up it.  

In my congested, mentally drained from illness mind, I said ""Hey babe, hot water rises right?""

Right away she looked back at me and screamed ""How much fucking peppermint oil did you put in?!""

I said I turned it upside down and maybe like 10 drops got out.  

So we jumped out, body covered in water with peppermint.  It burned like icy hot.  My balls were on fire.  My girlfriend starts crying from the pain, and is screaming.  I'm in the fetal position trying to wipe water off my balls. 

I then get the idea of jumping in the shower and seeing if getting the peppermint off of me was possible.  NOPE.  Makes it much worse.

Fast forward ten minutes, we are curled up on the couch both covered in multiple blankets trying to get warm.   It wears off on my girlfriend and she says she just feels numb, but it doesn't hurt anymore.  Takes me an extra 15 minutes for it to stop hurting.  

The heat from the blankets warmed me, but I felt like I had ice under my skin.  

Half an hour later, it went away.

And that's why I'm not allowed to draw our baths anymore.

Tl;dr: girlfriend and I are sick.  Decide to take bath. I put enough peppermint oil in bath.  My girlfriend and I get it seeping into our pores. Has the effect of icy hot.  Balls and asshole are in pain.  Girlfriend cries, we have to wait out the pain.  

Edit:  Holy shit, this is in the top ten all time TIFU's.  I'm honored and ashamed.

Circumcising males when they're infants should be illegal. I've never met a person who agrees with me and it's infuriating.,"I think it's barbaric. The foreskin is there to protect the glans. And as an infant it is literally fused to the head of the penis. So as a newborn, males have their foreskin ripped off the head of the penis and then cut off around the rim, sometimes with no anesthetic. And idk how you care for an open wound while keeping them in diapers that will eventually smear them in shit. 

It breaks my heart that my fianc√© wants any future boys we have to be circumcised. And his only reason is ""I want him to look like me"". I've told him I want him there to watch and listen to his newborn cry and scream from being mutilated for cosmetic reasons. I told him he will be the only one changing his diapers and treating the wound. 


""It's gross lol"" because you've grown up in a culture that has done this since biblical times. 

It is the exact equivalent of cutting off a baby girl's labia. Oh, it's for aesthetics. Oh, it will make girls less prone to utis. Oh, it'll eliminate smegma that builds up between the folds. Oh, it'll expose a mucus membrane and desensitize the clit. Oh, it'll make them less likely to get labia cancer. Oh, it'll prevent stds because there's less folds for the disease to hide in.

Every ""benefit"" of circumcision is a matter of hygiene and the same ""benefits"" would apply to girls who get their labia cut off.

TIFU by hanging out alone with 5 drunk girls,"So, these 5 girls asked me to come and hang out with them in their pool. 
I thought it was gonna be a little party, but no. It was just me and 5 ladies in a pool. Sounds like a every mans fantasy, right? 

Wrong. 

I was invited over to start up a fire pit because ""I can't do it myself"". 
So, I ask ""having a pool party, huh? Yea, I can do that!"" I get a reply ""yea, a party, sure!"" 

Red flag one. So, I take my happy and hopeful ass over to this house where the ""party"" is at. 

Red flag two, the fire pit is already a' blazin. 

I didn't think much of it, but I also noticed that only 5 girls in a swimming pool is kind of a small party, but I'm not complaining. I settle in, have a few drinks, hop in the pool and hang out with these ladies and all seems well.... then the night actually started to take off...

One of them got super wasted, stripped down naked and was running around the house hysterically crying, while we tried chasing her down so we could clothe her. Funny thing was, she was the only girl I didn't see drink alcohol. 
And like a brick wall showing up while your doing 90+ in you car, BAM she was blitzed. Then, Another girl looked at me at one point and said ""come here, I gotta tell you a secret"" So, I swim semi-drunkenly over to hear her little secret, but instead she kisses me. I'm thinking, ""okay not what I expected but I ain't mad."" 

As I go to kiss her back I hear, in an extremely angry tone, ""What the FUCK?!"" One of the other girls (the one who invited me) saw it and was irate.
She swims over to us, and I'm thinking that I'm about to be castrated, but my presence doesn't phase her, she moves straight to her friend and grabs her by the shoulder and a fistful of hair, and drags her out of the pool and onto the grass. 
They start fighting, like literally throwing fists and tackling each other on the ground, UFC style. 

But, in the blink of an eye, they stop and starting hugging each other and crying like they just saw some cheesy romantic movie with a predictable ending. I'm thinking to myself ""what the fuck. Should I be aroused or terrified?!"" 

I assure you, I was both.

After that, shit got scary. They threw me into the pool, and were trying to play some wrestling game, so they held me down. Now, I grew up with sisters who were rowdy, so I know how to push a lady whose trying to kill off me, but 5! IN THE DEEP END OF A POOL WHILE DRUNK. That shit got me praying to every God in every religion. I wasn't sure if they were trying to kill me, or got caught up in the moment, I was just trying to stay alive, man. Their ""playful"" laughter is something that will haunt me until my dying days. I thought it was the last thing I'd ever hear. 

Then things kinda settled down, so I, cautiously and reluctantly, stayed the night on the couch because I had too much to drink and I'm not trying to get a DUI or wreck my motorcycle. 
But I woke up to this god awful sound, like a beast was chowing on its prey, and I thought ""aw fuck. This is it. These ladies are a coven of witches or demons and my soul is due for atonement. MY LUST, MY GREED, I DESERVE THIS."" So, I flip around to better see what's happening, and the previously naked hysterically crying girl was vomiting everywhere. I mean really going at it. Like a fire hose. 

Then, after painting the floor with a fucked up rendition of Blue Poles by Jackson Pollock, she looks at me and says ""sorry, didn't mean to wake you"" and walks away. Like it was nothing. Then, I just closed my eyes in bewilderment, and waited until I was sober. And I got the fuck out of there.

AITA for lying to my son's girlfriend's parents?,"My son has been seeing this lovely girl for about 4 months.  They are both 16.  Her parents have a litany of issues (super controlling, narcissistic mom and alcoholic dad.)  Generally, because she lives much closer to the school, my son goes over there occasionally after school, and I pick him up in the evening.  I will also drive him there sometimes on weekends and pick him up when he's ready.

The mom has all sorts of odd rules for my son when he's there, which is fine.  It's her house.  Most of the rules seem to be based around her daughter's chastity.  He is allowed in her room, but not on the bed.  Then, weeks later, he is allowed on the bed, but not under the covers .WTF?  And she will check on them quite regularly, making sure they are being 'proper'.  (not under the covers, the door open etc.)  They also want him out before a certain time (which changes depending on ... ? )  Sometimes it's 7:30, sometimes it's 9:30.  Whatever.

Regardless, she usually doesn't come to our house, because her parents are so controlling.   Well, today she came over for the first time.   The night before, her mom called and wanted to talk to me.  I am a correctional officer and was working that night, so I wasn't home to take the call.  My son offers to let her to talk to my husband, who was home, but she only wanted to talk to me.   Later on, her dad calls, and he talks to my husband.   I don't have the details of the conversation, but basically, he wanted to make sure that there would be at least one parent home at all times and that we would keep an eye on them at all times.  My husband agreed.

Thing is, we don't really care.  I was sexually active at a younger age than them.  My son and I have had lots of talks about consent and not being sexually pushy with people and respect and birth control, etc.  He is a lovely boy, and I believe he would never push her to do anything she wasn't comfortable with.  They have been sexually active with each other already.  (teens will find a way!)  Anyway, not only did I not check on them constantly, I told him that as long as she was willing, I would give them as much privacy as they wanted, providing they were using protection.  My husband and I actually had to go out for a couple of hours, and I asked a good friend who lives just down the street if she would 'cover' for me, if this girl's parents called or showed up and pretend to be my cousin.  (parents did not have our exact address yet, so we would have had a warning about them showing up.)  Good friend laughed and agreed.   Turns out it wasn't needed.   Dad eventually came and picked her up.

I absolutely stand by my opinion that MY son can have privacy and agency over his own body at this age, but I am kind of wondering if I should have made that choice for someone else's child.  I kind of feel guilty, but I think her parents are WAY over the top control freaks.

TIFU by trusting some rando on Airbnb,"Shit River 2K19

We have a thousand words to explain all that transpired with Our Dear Friend Paul from August 3rd to August 4th, 2019. Let me spin you a tale...a tale of Shit River.

4:30 pm

Our initial impressions of the house were terrific! Our illustrious host, Paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. Paul was friendly! Check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. Everything was looking great!

6:00 pm

We return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. We fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. We had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! A few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.

8:15 pm

After a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. We discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). Plunging half successfully, we messaged Paul and let him know the situation. Only one working toilet isn't ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we'd make it work!

8:38 pm

The remaining toilet won't flush. The party grows worried. Paul assures us that he will call a plumber.

9:00 pm

Paul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won't be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. A five second Google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in Virginia Beach, but Paul did not want to call them. After ""informing"" Our Dear Friend Paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. A plumber was found! Magic!

9:30 pm

Raw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. Kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. The House likely possessed. Drinks have been drunk like it's the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or Uber to safety. After all, where would we go? We pray to whatever Eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.

10:01 pm

The stench. Dear god. The STENCH.

11:20 pm

Emergency plumber arrives with Paul and Paul's Friend in tow. One of them goes to the roof. One of them pounds a Pabst Blue Ribbon. Advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. We split the party.

12:20 am

Plumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for ""The Final Blasting."" Paul's Friend fails to discover how to ""switch off his nose"" and taps out (""I'm out man, I'm out.""). It's been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. The backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *For now.*

12:22 am

Paul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. Classic Paul! We oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.

12:24 am

THE FINAL BLASTING. The Stench. The Horror. The Splatter. We all take 2d6 damage.

1:00 am

Paul & Co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. He requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. We decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. We also decide to leave the next morning.

2:00 am: The Witching Hour

Lights flicker ominously. The House isn't finished with us yet‚Ä¶

4:30 am

Paul offers a full refund (excellent). He later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). We ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. He offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).

10:30 am

The party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. We take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the Toilet Gods.

11:10 am

We commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. After completion, we agree never to speak of this again. Who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?

11:11 am

THE GREAT GURGLE. We hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. Was it the broken spirit of Paul's Friend chugging another PBR? NOPE. The shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.

11:15 am

We hasten our efforts to flee. Paul is called. We finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.

11:30 am

We convene to discuss departure. Suddenly, one of our party realizes we've been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping SHIT RIVER POOLING IN THE HALLWAY. Fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the Rubicon. We form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.

11:32 am

Water oozes up from the baseboards. Satan's Septic Tank thirsts for blood. The lights flicker once more.

11: 35 am

Our Dearest Friend Paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: ""This house is fucked."" Agreeing with Paul's uncanny observation, we flee The House. The smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.

TL;DR I trusted my Airbnb to have functional plumbing but instead it exploded.",tifu
WIBTA if I buy my girlfriend a cheap engagement ring?,"I guess it goes without saying that I am proposing, but I should mention my girlfriend doesn't know I will be. I picked out a ring I think she'll like. She never wears rings and isn't a massive fan of diamonds. So I found a really nice gold one with an emerald that's surrounding by small diamonds. She loves green and gold jewellery, and I spent a long time finding this one. It's a created emerald which I think she'll prefer because she definitely wouldn't want any sort of conflict jewels. 

The ring is cheap. It was ¬£300 and has actually gone down to ¬£180. I mentioned this to my sister who said I was a dick, essentially. Apparently, she'll be showing it to her friends (some of whom are engaged), who will know about rings and clarity and such. She says they will see that it's cheap and it will be embarrassing for her. I'm 90% sure my girlfriend doesn't know much about jewellery and clarity.

I could probably get a similar ring that's more expensive. I certainly wouldn't know why I'm paying more, I don't think she would either. However, I am starting a new job soon and was going to buy a new TV for ¬£250. I kind of realised I'm willing to spend more on myself for a random treat yourself present than an engagement ring and I started understanding my sister's perspective a bit more. So WIBTA?

Edit: I just want to clarify that we have talked about marriage and are both on board. It's the proposal in terms of when and how I do it that would be a surprise.

Edit 2: I really want to thank everyone for contributing and helping me out. I left to run some errands and returned to an overwhelming response full of additional advice which goes above and beyond, I really appreciate it.

If you make your husband/boyfriend sleep on the couch because you're pissed at them (and you share the same bed) I'm gonna assume you're a bitch,"Short of them cheating on you or something similar that is a huge breach of your relationship, no one has the right to force someone else out of their own bed. It's just as much theirs as it is yours. If you're too pissed at them to sleep in the same bed then that's on you and you should go to the couch.

This goes for guys too, but I've never heard a guy say he's gonna make his wife sleep on the couch because he's upset with her. I've heard it multiple times from women both in real life and on tv.

Edit: I really appreciate everyone's concern, but I'm fortunately not posting from the couch. The issue was between two friends in a relationship and my wife and I both thought it was terrible.

Fast forward and were fucked hardly holding our shit together, being somewhat responsible we leave and call an uber. We went to his apartment and chilled and watched netflix and whatnot until we made a bet on some weird shit. I dont remember what it was on but if he won he would get a titjob and if I won he would get Graham crackers and icing from the store and we would make those Graham cracker Christmas houses, yes it was Spring, yes we were wasted.


So the outcome had us in bed with me lying on my back holding my tits together and him on my chest thrusting between my tits. The liquor probably helped a lot but I thought it was hot as fuck. He starts moaning and groaning a whole lot more and I close my eyes and he cums on my face and chest. Not a second later I hear a girl screeching. It scares the shot out of me so I scream and open my eyes and instantly get cum in my left eye. The guy starts laughing his ass off, his girlfriend/ wife starts crying while still screaming and I'm still laying down and I cant see shit. She runs out of the house and the guy grabs a pair of pants and runs after her. 


I dont really know what I was supposed to do so I just kind of took a shower and left. Their shower was really nice though. It was really tall and open and kind of looked like the top of a lighthouse.

TIFU by leaving a dildo on the table and ruining my sons life,"This happened Saturday night into Sunday morning but my shame has subsided enough for me to write this out. Also no throwaway because whatever. 

We have a 12 yr old son. 

Saturday night after he went to bed, husband and I decided to get a little sex in. After quite a few drinks, we also decided to break out the ""toy"" box. Husband leaves the room with a few dildos and says he will be back. (He was putting new batteries in them, etc). He comes back, we do our thing and go to sleep. We wake up in the morning and our son comes into our room and says ""what is that on the table?!""
...I immediately realized the FU. Husband did not so he asks ""what is it?"" 
Son: a purple banana (ps he's 12 so he knew what it was) and he walks out of the room. 
Cue immediate shame/laughter. I wanted the floor to open up and swallow me. 

Side note. We did not use that particular ""purple banana"" that night-thank god. 

After we composed ourselves husband goes into sons room and says ""what do you want for breakfast?"" 
Son says ""I lost my appetite"" 

I'm still dying inside. I'm sure son is too.

TL;DR left a dildo on the table like a moron, son won't ever be the same.

Edit: ok guys-you realize it's 2019, the internet is alive and well, and 7th grade 12yr old boys are exploring etc right?! It's not crazy that he knows what dildos are.

Also edit: I didn't treat it like it was shameful and I know I didn't actually ruin his life. But no one wants to think of their parents having sex. We laughed about it afterwards and made purple banana jokes the rest of the day. We are open and communicate etc. I was mortified and still am, because it's embarrassing.",tifu
"AITA for telling my wife WE are making our daughter, not her?","Okay, so my wife and I are expecting our first child. She is 7 months along and we got an ultrasound yesterday to check on the progress (my wife's medical issues caused the OBGYN to be extra cautious). 

During the appointment, the tech was pointing out our daughter's different body parts, telling us where the legs and feet are. It was the first time we didn't really need the help, because we could see our baby looking like a real baby. My wife started crying, and I was comforting her, when she said the words. ""I can't believe I'm making a human being.""

I kept comforting her, but I waited a few minutes and, once the tech was gone, gently reminded her that we are both the parents, not just her. I also told her that saying she's ""making"" the baby on her own is not accurate, since I provided half the genetic material. 

My wife was still emotional at this point, and she started crying again thinking I don't appreciate what she's putting her body through to be pregnant. Obviously this is false, especially since her pregnancy has been so tough that I've attended at least two doctors appointments every month. I show her with actions, not words, that I appreciate her. 

I just don't think it's fair to claim I haven't contributed something to making our daughter. She is still upset the next day. So, AITA?

AITA for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?,"I have waited tables for the last three years.

During my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. They were a pleasure to have as customers. They ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

When I was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, I walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. When I rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. I figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. They ordered their entrees and I went off to handle other tables.

About five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. At this point I started getting concerned, but I took the order and cheerfully said I'd be right back. This time, I went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. He was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, I told him to just trust me. 

A few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and Mrs. Pregnant Woman was also getting into it. I figured that since she didn't notice, things were OK. The problem came when I took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. When Mrs. Pregnant Woman got to the counter, I saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). My bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

It was too late for me to edit them back, so I just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. They all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. They were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an Uber.

Several minutes later Mrs. Pregnant Woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. I fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. She blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. I said no, but told her that I assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. It was a lame lie and I'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. I did so. Then she talked to my manager. My manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

I stood my ground and told her that I'm not going to be responsible for FAS. She told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. She also informed me that I could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

But when I talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. The entire staff at the restaurant is against me and I think that I'm going to call in and tell my manager that I quit, but I still feel in the right here. I would like some perspective on this and if I'm the asshole here.",AmItheAsshole

[Update] [ME / CA] My teenage daughter was sexually assaulted while visiting her father for the summer.,"Well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. Christ.

Yesterday afternoon, after I made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), I called her gynecologist. (I have uterine issues so I got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.) 

She was very understanding, and offered to stay late if I wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. So, I called the police, let them know I was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.

My daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when I explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention. 

The doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the STI tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. Though I know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, I'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.

After the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. He sat down with my daughter in our living room, while I hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear I'd hear it.)

The detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in Maine I needed to speak to. I made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. He left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. He also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family. 

After he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on Facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. Within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that I make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. I told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up. 

This morning, I got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. His assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in CA, the custody arrangement is in CA, and it will be amended in CA (since CA is her state of residency), and in CA they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. He also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she HAD to go visit her father, much less in this situation. 

I have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that I could help her as needed. Right now she's mostly been playing World of Warcraft and eating junk food, but I feel like at least right now I'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.

I want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. I will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.",legaladvice

AITA for wanting my girlfriend to wear makeup and take care of body hair?,"I know how the title sounds, hear me out. My \[26M\] gf \[24F\] takes forever in the bathroom. Upwards of 1 hour, sometimes closer to 2. When I playfully ribbed her about this, she'd get irritated but nothing major. 3 months ago I was playfully teasing her and she flipped out. She said she won't do anything anymore, and true to her word she hasn't shaved, waxed, or put on makeup since then, and wears her hair looking like bedhead. I told her that I got her point and would appreciate it if she resumed doing things that I also do to stay presentable. Her head hair improved a bit (although not even close to how it was before) but she still has hair on her legs and underarms, semi-unibrow etc. Now she's saying I have to pay her to resume taking care of herself, which I find crazy as I'm not her sugar daddy. Why should I pay for her to upkeep herself like she's my sugar baby?

I understand that it's her body, her choice etc., but if there are any guys out there who think they would be ok if their gf had long underarm hair then you're a better man than me. I haven't pushed her to do anything, nor am I enforcing any ultimatums. If, as she says, I've been conditioned to want her to look a certain way... well, that sucks, but it's not my fault. If we broke up, she'd pay for all of this beauty stuff herself, so why should I pay? Anyone who says I'm TA, are you going to then start paying for all your girlfriends' beauty regimens, or else be fine with 100% body hair and no makeup or hair care ever? Be honest with yourselves.

**Gf's side:** He keeps being a dick about how long I would take in the bathroom, so as he said, I quit things he didn't even realize I was doing. No makeup, no shaving/waxing, no brows, no waxing those moustache hairs, I have curly frizzy hair so I stopped using product or straightening/curling with an iron, no mani/pedi, no touching up or redoing my highlights. Do I look like a beast? Sure. Am I a comfy, smug beast? Hell yes.

He rightfully pointed out that he takes care of himself for me (by shaving his beard and cutting his hair), so I obligingly waxed my upper lip and got a haircut. I'm continuing to do this whole thing because 1) it's so much less effort for me, 2) it's way cheaper, and 3) now that I stopped, I feel like... why do I ever have to do all this shit. It's unfair. And if I have to do it because both of us have been conditioned to see me doing these things as the basic standards for a woman, then he should pay half the costs. I conservatively spend at least $1k a year on brows, shaving supplies, hair products, highlights, haircuts, and makeup. Conservatively. He should have to pay me at least half if he wants me to do it, and extra for painful things like bikini waxes if he wants me to do them again. Otherwise it's not fair.

**Both:** We love each other a lot and aren't actually fighting. We recognized that we're having a difference in opinion, and since neither has been able to sway the other we came to the court of public opinion.

**EDIT (from bf):** alright, I'm the asshole. You know, it wasn't even the people saying I *was* the asshole that convinced me so much as the people saying I wasn't. No way in hell do I want to hold the same opinion as some of you, so if you think I'm not TA then I definitely am. My girlfriend not wanting to *remove body hair* is not the same as me walking around without showering, ""in stained shirts and greasy hair"". Jesus. The amount of sexist pigs that personally reached out to assure me that I'm not TA and the Reddit commenters are comprised of libtards, cucks, feminazis, etc... man.

I think it's reasonable to say that I'm allowed to no longer be attracted to her physically after this, and in that case I would either pay up or we break up. However, luckily, I am still very much into her. I would *highly prefer* the lack of body hair, but it's far from a dealbreaker and I think those who pointed out that I should be trying to unlearn these standards are correct. As I said before, this was never a fight. And for all of you calling my gf a fugly whatever and telling me I can do much better, she's always hot as fuck, have fun in your mom's basement tonight.

**EDIT 2 (from gf):** Thank you, Reddit, for knocking some sense into this mans. He let me shave his legs. He said he feels like a dolphin.

Others who report similar behavior to HR have been fired.,"NJ: I am an adult male and my boss (male, few years older) consistently touches me in front of dozens of other people in a professional office setting. He has put me in a headlock, he often grabs my shoulders or neck and shakes me, he tousles my hair, he often hipchecks me when I'm standing at someone else's desk. I've told him to stop but that makes it worse. Other people have complained to HR and been fired for this exact complaint, so I feel like I have no recourse there. 

On top of that he is a blatant racist and sexist, and says shit out loud in the office that I wouldn't even say to my friends at the bar. 

Should I get a hidden camera on my desk and present footage to him or to HR? or try the HR route myself? Should I just talk to him first and then get a camera? Not sure what the best path forward is. Interested to hear your thoughts. ",legaladvice
Waking up early is fucking awesome.,"Seriously, it's pretty damn great. You get to watch the sun rise up, you have more time to get stuff done, and the world is quieter. Not to mention it's way easier to get to sleep when the night comes. 

Waking any later than like 8 makes me feel crappy and like I already wasted the day, and I end up feeling super frustrated when the day's already done and I haven't done anything.

Spamming suicide hotline numbers at depressed people or suicidal people doesn't seem that helpful.,"You know the last thing I think most suicidal or depressed people want to hear is? You need to talk to someone. You should talk to a therapist. You should call this hotline. 

You think they haven't fucking thought of that? No shit. It's the first thing anyone says when someone is depressed; you should talk to a therapist.

Honestly? I don't think there's a way to measure it, but if someone calls that hotline I don't think they were going to do it anyways (other than the ones that called it and did it on the call).

It's just annoying to me that when people say they're depressed and society sucks, and they joke about (or are serious about) killing themselves, no one ever offers real solutions but just says ""call this random number and talk to someone, oh I just know how you feel I've been there before""


Edit: this seems split in terms of popularity. I'm gonna take this time to lay out what worked for me. Feel free to tell me I'm an idiot, but I swear to god this worked for me. You know what pulled me out of my slump? Realizing all of these other styles of help were bullshit, and that it was entirely my own mental state. If I was going to get out of it, I was going to have to be the one to make changes. At face value it sounds silly, but I really internalized this idea. I forced myself to stop relying on other people for my own happiness. It made me a more cynical person towards society as a whole, but damnit if it didn't help I don't know what did. Realizing society's shortcomings were what put me in that place to begin with made me understand that in order to overcome, I was going to be the only one that could truly change my own personal mental well being. I took this mentality to heart, and started focusing on things like hobbies. It wasn't easy, but I spent my time learning to do things like play guitar, or build circuits, or get really good at a certain video game, or produce beats, etc. This idea may be a crock of shit, but I gave this advice to another one of my depressed friends telling them I thought the advice people generally give is bullshit. I actually found that giving a bleak response of understanding and being real with them and not being all ""yeah, talk to someone!"" Etc. was more helpful. If you can actually relate to how that depressed person feels instead of just telling them everything will be okay, you have a better chance of helping. They don't want to hear ""everything is okay"", they want to hear ""yeah you're right everything really is fucked."" If you can truly relate to them and the way they feel without trying to tell them how to fix it explicitly, they'll appreciate it.

Edit 2: I should have been more explicit when I wrote this. I'm sure hotlines help some people, I'm not saying they don't. I'm also not saying therapy doesn't help people.

Edit 3: Here's an analogy. Your friend is in a hole (depression). You're standing outside of the hole. You're shouting phone numbers down into the hole and saying things like ""you're gonna be fine, it's okay"". In reality, it would be much more helpful if you could jump into the hole with them and show them the way out.

 It bugs me the fuck out that just because americans are seen as ""good"" people in todays society, we dont treat native american killing at the same level as holocaust, when it should be. 

Seriously, you see media whine about asylum for immagrants, what about killing and kicking off native americans and confining them in ""reserves"" because americans were fucking shitting themselves for more land?

Alcohol is overrated and drinking in General is not that fun.,"I personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me I personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. I never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am I missing something ?

And before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends I doubt that since I have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. Hes probably part of the reason I dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon....,"A woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. As she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. 

After a moment or two, the vet 
shook his head and sadly said, ""I'm sorry, your duck, Cuddles, has passed away."" 

The distressed woman wailed, 
""Are you sure?""
""Yes, I am sure. Your duck is dead,"" replied 
the vet.. 

""How can you be so sure?"" she protested. ""I mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. He might just be in a coma or 
something."" 

The vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. He returned a few minutes later 
with a black Labrador Retriever. As the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. He then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head. 

The vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. A few minutes later he returned with a cat. The cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. The cat sat
back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room. 

The vet looked at the woman and said, ""I'm sorry, but as I said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."" 

The vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and 
produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

The duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$150!"" she cried, ""$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

The vet shrugged, ""I'm sorry. If you had just taken my word for it, 
the bill would have been $20, but with the Lab Report and the Cat Scan, it's now $150.""

so she calls Hannah's dad to sort the situation out and he tells her that he is still at work and hannah should be home alone. 

I walk over to Hannah's mums house and we drive up to Hannah's dads. 

turns out hannah and my daughter wanted to get drunk and throw a house party with older guys, I was seeing red at this point and grabbed her by the arm and dragged her out.

 when we got home I made her hand over her phone and laptop which she has lost the privilege of having for 2 weeks (exluding school work) and she is banned from going to the shops with friends for 2 months.

TIFU by walking in on my teenaged son masterbating.,"This just happened and I am still wishing it didn't.   My  15 year old son and I are home, I'm working on a puzzle and making dinner, he is playing Fortnite.   He disappears for a little while and I go to find him.    I didn't really need him for anything, just wanted to say 'hi' since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.

I start walking down the hallway towards his room‚Äîour house isn't super big and I knew he was in there.   The lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but I could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.

I decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   He was lying with his back to me, I could tell by where his phone was.   As I am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, I see it.   My son's boner.   As I was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   It all happened so fast and I was already airborne before I realized what was happening.   I did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son's boner through his boxer briefs.   

The entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, I'm sure.   I have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, AND I DON'T WANT TO.

At that point, I am still flopped down on his bed.   Both of us are well aware that I just saw him whacking off.    Both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   I say, 'Dinner is almost ready.'   (It wasn't)
He said, 'Ok, I'll be out in a minute.'
I said, 'No hurry.'

Now I'm standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he'll need if he ever finds out I posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering WHY DON'T BOYS CLOSE THE DOOR WHEN THEY ARE MASTURBATING?  

tl/dr:   Basically the title.     

Edit: spelling.   Dammit, I can't change the spelling of 'masturbating' in the title.   Oh well.   I fixed 'Fortnite' though.   

Edit 2:  for those asking:

‚ÄîI am mom.
‚ÄîI want to be clear, I have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   I am a nurse.   I talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   The horrifying part is that I walked in on him.   That was not ideal.  For either one of us.  
‚Äîhis door was OPEN.  
‚ÄîI have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before I walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   
‚Äîhe isn't on any social media.   I am quite confident that his identity is protected.

I [23m] unknowingly outbid my GF [26] on eBay on a present for her. Should I tell her I was the other bidder or keep hush?,"Hi Reddit,

Glad to be posting something that isn't cheating or something fucked up.

My GF and I really love this particular band, I always keep an eye out for cool/rare merch to get a little 'anytime' gift for each-other.

Cue last week. Her birthday is coming up and I found a rare version of a Vinyl on eBay for waaaay under market price. I instantly bid on it and day later someone bids back, I end up in a little bidding war with this randomer and eventually win. The next day my GF and I are chatting and she begins to tell me that she had found this really cool rare bit of merch but got out bid and she really wanted it for our collection. That's when it hits me, I was bidding against her.

Now, normally I would've just told her it was me and we would've got a good giggle out of it, but considering I was buying it as a surprise (birthday) I kept quiet. However now I'm starting to think I should just tell her as she's pretty bummed out about it (May seem silly to some but its a really important thing to us)

Reddit, should I just own up and tell her or wait a week and a half for the big reveal then?

But we have literally everything thing in common so I figured I'd give it a shot. So after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

I get there and pick a table. After waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. That's very strange so I assume she must be after something. Free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, I don't know.

So I explain to her that I'm actually waiting for someone and I don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

That's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one I'm waiting for. She told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

And she was also testing me to see if I would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. So here's the thing, I don't know how I feel about being ""tested"". I don't want to live my life questioning every decision I make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

But she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. I'm not sure how I should proceed.

TIFU by stripping in front of my girlfriends BFF's [NSFW],"It's as stupid as it sounds.

Yesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her BFFs. They usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.

Around that time I'm usually at the gym so to not disturb them. But yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so I went there an hour earlier.

Sometimes after I come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.
So I come home early and hear the TV running and I assumed, that she didn't hear me.
That's when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.

I busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.
Her best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. Some get red and look away, some stare at me like they've never seen a man's privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved WTF. 

The silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. I uttered a loud FUCK and she instantly replied with: ‚ÄûGood plan, bad execution."" Her friends all laughed and even I had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.

I even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. Of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.

AITA for telling my mother-in-law that she can't control how I act in my home?,"My mother-in-law moved in with us about three months ago. It's been ok. She and I are clashing personalities and cultures, and it's come up more often now that we share a similar space. She is a traditional Hispanic woman with a strong sense of decorum and family hierarchy. I am white, liberal in all ways, and agnostic about most traditions, including and especially the need to obey elders.

Before, out of consideration to my spouse and out of a belief in the my ""my house, my rules adage,"" I used to watch what I said around her very carefully because we only visited with her about once a month. But when my spouse asked if she could live with us, I said I was okay with it as long as I no longer had to walk on eggshells around her. My spouse agreed and told their mother that she needs to respect that we do and say things differently in our home than she may like. I don't know how her mother responded to that but it never came up again.

Last week, my 10-year-old and I were chatting while having breakfast while she was in the kitchen. We were goofing around and making bodily function sounds to each other. We are very mature, I know. But when I said, ""I fart in your general direction!"" and made a loud raspberry sound at her (she was giggling like crazy), my mother-in-law slammed down her coffee mug and said, in Spanish, ""Don't you dare teach my granddaughter to be so disrespectful. I will not allow this kind of vulgarity in my home any longer."" And I said, in English (I can understand Spanish but can't speak it well), ""This is my home. You don't get a say in how I interact with my kids, or how any of us speak or act."" She stormed away and now isn't speaking to me.

My spouse says ITA because I embarrassed her in front of our daughter and because I expected her to accept too much, too quickly. They also say that I am being a little culturally insensitive and that I need to respect that abuela will be deeply offended by how I spoke to her, so I need to apologize. But I think it was important for her to see that I will stand up for our interactions/myself and also to stick to what we originally agreed on--that I won't be policed in my own home.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for telling the guy my fiance left me for how our relationship ended?,"This happened a couple years ago but some of our mutual friends still think I was the dick in this situation, so I thought I would submit myself to judgement.

I was living with and discussing marriage with a girl I'd been dating for around 3 years.  She went off on a school trip around the end of February/beginning of March  and when she came back,  things seemed off.  It was just little things, like she started texting ""luv ya"" instead of ""love you"" and stuff like that.  I finally asked her what the deal was around the end of April, and we ended up ""taking a break"". I moved out, but we still hung out almost every day, still went on dates, still had sex. 

I had bought her a new cell phone around the time she got back, an LG V10 (believe it or not this is important). Around the end of May or so, the phone malfunctions and bootloops endlessly, as they are known to do.  She gives it to me so I can try to warranty it or something to get some of my money back, while she buys herself a new phone.  I did some research and discovered that the bootloop could be temporarily bypassed by freezing the phone, so I decide to give it a shot so I can try to pull her pictures and stuff off and generally just try to win some good guy points.  It works, and as soon as I boot it up she starts getting messages from ""David"". Lots of messages, of the not so innocent variety. 

I pop open the messages to see that they go back all the way to her school trip. She's been seeing this guy in secret for months, both before and after our ""break"" while also giving me the runaround and acting like we're on the verge of getting back together.  It's also clear that he doesn't know about me at all, every time he tries to make plans with her while we were doing somrthing, she was just making excuses like ""spending time with family"". 

I shoot him a few texts, tell him who I am,  that I just discovered I was being lied to, and that I suspected he was being lied to as well.  Turns out he was recently divorced because his wife had been cheating, and he was horrified to discover that he had been the ""other guy"".  Long story short, we both washed our hands of her and went our separate ways, but literally every female I know has told me that it was not my place to tell him and that I should have left well enough alone.  I even had to leave my job because the women there ostracized me so heavily because of it.  The way i see it, he deserved the truth and I helped him dodge a major bullet before it could hurt him like it hurt me.  Clearly she was the asshole for cheating, but am I the asshole for exposing it?

Edit to answer some common questions:

>Why did you tell everybody?

I didn't.  I told one person at work, because I thought they were my friend, and who doesn't need a friend to talk to when shit like that goes down?  That one person told everyone else in the office.  We also lived in a really small town at the time, and gossipers gonna gossip.

>Why are you calling her your fiancee when it sounds like you never proposed?

When I said we discussed marriage, I meant that we had sat down and decided that we were getting marries. Plans were already in the works and a date had already been set.  I've always believed that a step that big should come from mutual agreement rather than springing it on someone and putting them on the spot for an answer. Maybe I'm wrong.

>What did you do to make her cheat on you?

Well, to paraphrase her reasoning, we had been together for a while and the relationship wasn't ""new and exciting"" anymore. She met a dude that made her feel the new and exciting feelings again so she decided to fuck him. Also, fuck you for asking that.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by having sex with an upset stomach [NSFW],"This happened today. My husband will probably find this and laugh, so if so, hey babe! 

Earlier today my husband and I began to fool around; I've had a somewhat upset stomach for the past few days but I thought I'd gotten past the worst of it. Evidently, I had not. 

As my husband and I got closer to finishing I felt a pressure in my bowels but decided to keep going because what was the worst that could happen? Once we finished I felt a sort of ""pressure"" by my butthole and went to feel only to stick my finger in poo. I had literally orgasmed so hard that I shit, and on my husbands balls too. All I could utter was a simple ""oh no""

My husband immediately figured out what had happened and started laughing; I was a mixture of laughter and tears of embarrassment, but he just comforted me and was gleeful in that now he could claim he ""actually fucked the shit out of [me]."" I'm lucky to have someone who gives that little a shit (no pun intended). 

tl;dr: Had sex and pooped on my husband

*Update: I avoided this for 3 days to see if my husband found it. Though there are people claiming in the comments they're him, they are not lmao. Also, no, we're not getting divorced! He's still making jokes about it so I think we're good.*",tifu

[Edit at the bottom: Better timeline] 

[Second edit at bottom: Thank you and some understandings] 

First of all, thank you to all the kind people who commented on my original post. Those who told me to stick to my guns made me feel stronger and had saved me from further years of being totally stepped on. 

Like the original post said, my boyfriend and I got into a heated argument because I, a rape survivor, was incredibly uncomfortable watching A Clockwork Orange with him. 

I had left our apartment for a few days and had some time to think. I've been with him for three years now and it is almost as if this tiny little bomb caused my whole world to blow up. I've realized how many times I've put my own feelings aside for him, how many things I have missed out on because I was busy catering to his feelings.

Yesterday, I went home so we could talk. And needless to say, it didn't go well. He was still furious with me, claiming I never care about him or his interests. I counteracted this by listing almost everything I've done for him. I asked him why he was being like this, he knows what I've been through and has always been so understanding.

Cue the real person that he is coming through. He said something along the lines of ""honestly, I was just going along with it because you seem like you needed support but I don't see the big deal."" Asking me why I couldn't just ""get over it"" because it happened ""so long ago."" (I've been assaulted three times. Once when I was ten, again at 16, and then again last year. But that's besides the point, even if it happened once a thousand years ago, it would still affect a survivor.) 

He then continued to blame me for his aggression, saying he was angry because we haven't had sex in a couple weeks. (I have bad spouts of body hatred due to my PTSD and do not like being touched when I'm in this headspace.) He advised that I maybe try going to therapy twice a week instead of just once and maybe that could help. 

I didn't know what to say or what to do. I was terrified of the man in front of me. All of this over a movie? I was shocked and hurt. So, I left. His name is on the lease so I'm not in any binds with him, thank god. I packed my shit and didn't look back. 

I'm still really shaken up. I've known him for so long and never saw this coming. It was like an immediate switch flipped on in his brain. I didn't know that man who I was talking to and I never want to again.

I'm staying at a friends place for now until I make enough to rent my own. Very thankful for my steady job and even steadier friends.

Just needed to get this off my chest I suppose. I haven't really told my friends the extent of what happened. I don't know why. Maybe I'm embarrassed. I don't know. 

Thank you all for the support. Thank you for reading <3

[EDIT] Someone commented and I now see the timeline seems a little murky. Apologies that I wasn't more specific.

Original fight happened on Tuesday. I left that night and stayed out Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Yesterday morning, I made my original post looking for a little bit of outside advice in this situation and then yesterday late evening is when this big blowout happened. Apologies again for any confusion, I now see how it could've been a little weird because of my wording and lack of specifics!

[EDIT 2] Thank you for the two silver. I'm not sure why I've gotten them? But thank you. Second, I've been thinking about it all day, really stewing on everything and thinking back to the past three years and the weeks leading up to this and I've realized that X wasn't as peaches and cream like I really thought him to be. Yes, he was incredibly supportive and kind to me, especially surrounding my trauma. However, I believe this to be because I never said no to him. Everything I did was to make him happy. These past couple weeks, I have started to say no to him. I really believe he never thought I would do this and it caused a lot of anger for him. The film isn't why we broke up, or why he blew up, the film was simply the ""final straw"" in terms of him tolerating me saying no. 

Truly thank you for all the kind words and support. I really just posted this to vent and surely didn't expect all of this. <3",relationship_advice

My (17M) twin sister (17F) has been sleeping in my bed with me,"We're fraternal (obviously) and we've always been really close. Her boyfriend unexpectedly died in an accident about two weeks ago, which has made her so sad that she can barely function.

The day after he died, she knocked on my door at like 3 AM. When I told her to come in, all she said was ""I can't be alone in my room for one more second"". Then she climbed onto my bed, got under the sheets, and went to sleep. I didn't protest or say anything, I just let her do what she wanted.

After that night, she slept in my bed every night for about four nights. It was the same situation each time. She'd come in my room and not really ask, she'd just get in my bed and go to sleep. Sometimes she'd say something like ""talk about anything to distract me until I fall asleep"". She doesn't sleep in my room every night anymore, but she does it every few nights. She did it two nights ago and I'm pretty sure she'll do it again.

I have a king sized bed so it's not like she's too close to me or anything, we don't even touch all night and it doesn't really make me uncomfortable, but I'm just wondering if this is normal for someone who's grieving. Also, should I tell my parents? She asked me not to but I don't know what to do

AITA for becoming hysterical at a school secretary's expense?,"Throwaway- Im just going to get in to it.

I (19M) got a call from my mother frantically telling me that she got a call from my sister's school because apparently she had ingested peanuts, she is deathly anaphylactic, I was at home for reading week, and am studying for upcoming midterms, but dropped everything and drove as legally fast as possible to get down to the school.

I ran in to the the office which was really crowded. There was only one secretary, and I knew instantly who it was- My mother and alot of other parents complain about her being a short-tempered smart ass.

I ran in but there was a line up, I told her my urgent need to talk to her right now due to my sisters allergic reaction and she looked at me and asked if I was blind ""there's a line hun"".

I waited for about 2 minutes before telling her this really cant wait, she put up a finger and picked up the phone.

I got upset and she called a hall monitor to escort me outside the office until she was ""Ready to talk to me"" I was yelling to tell her about my sister's allergic reaction yet she told me she didn't want to hear it. I was in absolute awe at her attitude, especially with the situation I was in.

I dialed 911 because it seemed like the school didn't give any fucks about my sister. The secretary saw me and ran out to to tell me to hang up.

She started by telling me ""See hun, I told you to wait for a reason- there was a mix up, A student told your sister that she gave her something w/ peanuts as a joke, we are dealing w/ that student right now, I could have handled this situation a lot better- I have a lot of students to deal with""

I looked at her and said ""what on earth are you talking about, my sister is deathly allergic and you expect me not to be worried and to wait and do nothing? Every fucking second counts in an emergency you fucking idiot, what were you expecting? Were you waiting to keep me on edge for as long as possible before telling me?""

I yelled at her for a bit more and she started to tear up and walked off, the monitor told me to leave ""The school isn't going to deal with a hysterical child, we are waiting for your parents, where we will then deal with your attitude""

Are you serious? How am I supposed to react in that situation? Yes, I agree I was really angry, but I feel like I was justified- My sister could have fucking died, all she had to say was there was a mix up- I would have waited if I heard a logical reason like that as to why she didn't need to talk to me right at that moment. AITA?

EDIT- 

To add context, some people are confused as to why I didn't immediately go to the hospital, the reasons why are because

1.) I don't know what hospital to go to

2.) they were not contacting me, even though im on her emergency contact

3.) from my understanding, she ran to a teacher and told her she was going to have an allergic reaction, so she got sent to the nurse and my mom was notified, before anything went down the idiotic student who tricked her, told the teacher that it was a ""prank"" and that she didn't actually have any peanuts, obviously it was a really dumb and small prank that turned in to a big situation, I guess the faculty themselves were confused about what was actually going on so they were unsure what to actually do.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by falling asleep in the back of my boyfriend's car,"Last summer. We're on a road trip from New Mexico to Mexico. We have a Honda Element converted for living in, so I crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. He stops at a gas station in the desert of Arizona and while he's pumping, I get out to use the bathroom. Come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. I jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. I sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. I reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.

I go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. Obviously they do, but whatever. So I start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think I'll steal it I guess. I go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. I realize I don't know my boyfriends number by heart so I just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. He doesn't. I use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when I call.

I resort to explaining to everyone whose phone I ask to use my situation. Some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and I was just being modest. It's been about 2 hours now. The store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, I'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

A cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. I explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. She tells me I can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. I ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. We're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. I just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. And there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

He said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized I wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. And that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. He thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

EDIT: I understand IFU by not relaying my need to pee.
Also that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. Also have never heard of this Last Man on Earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. I have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened IRL.

I (30m) and my wife(31f) decided to take custody of my half sister(10f) after my stepfather died in an accident. I suspect that she was abused.,"This is actually so heartbreaking to write. I really never knew my stepfather that much, because my mother married him after I moved out. My mother died fighting breast cancer and the custody of my half-sister was given to my stepdad. She was only 4 when my mom passed away.

I used too see her once in a while. She was always a quiet child. She didn't speak much to me. I always remember thinking something was wrong with my stepfather. He just didn't seem like a nornal person.

So, he died in an accident and I was asked if I was willing to adopt her. I and my wife have a 5yo daughter and we were trying to have another child when this happened and we felt that we could give her a better life. We were actually so happy. My daughter was very excited because she got an elder sister. She was very auiet and reserved but we thought that it was natural. 

But yesterday she came to me and she told me that she ate some chocolate from the fridge without asking us. I told her it was fine, and that this was her home and she could have whatever she wanted to.

But she suddenly started crying and told me that she deserved to be punished because she stole something. I was really taken aback by what I heard. My wife was alarmed and talked to her one on one and I was really shocked.

I (37m) just inadvertantly stumbled upon some suspicious activity with my wife (36f),"So our phone bill came due but it was more than usual so I gave it a once over to see where the extra charges came from. Turned out to be new activations, no big deal. Although, while on the main page I noticed my wife's last month text count was over 7k. Shes a very busy lady, a demanding job and 2 separate volunteers positions. I expect her to have a lot of texts. I got to thinking about it and still decided that an average of 250 per day is insanely high given that shes at work 10+ hours a day and even gets snippy with me when I text her at work cause shes busy.....Who could she be texting? I decided to go ahead and look at the detail and sure enough theres one number that she texts every day from pretty much when she gets in the car in the morning till shes laying in bed at night. 

I honestly dont know what to think. My curiosity got to me and I started plowing through old phone bills. This number started showing up on August the 8th. Since then over 16k texts have been exchanged. Often into the wee hours of the morning. Shes never mentioned any new friends... 

So I get home this evening and get the kids ready for dinner, she starts looking for her charger and I start helping her find it. I found it and go to put it in her purse right when a text comes in. I HATE being that guy but I did it. Checked her phone, dont have the passcode but saw who the text was from. Some dude . She has him programmed first and last name. Checked time against latest activity and that dude has the number that shes been texting so much. Looked him up, hes a single guy that has absolutely zero to do with anything that shes affiliated with so they aren't coworkers....they are friends on fb though... oh and I also found my wife's vibrator which has been in the closet for 6 years sitting right in her purse! Said nothing about either and just let it go until i figure out what's going on. 

I love my wife and I trust her completely, i think. I dont even know when she would have time for an affair given how busy she always is. Or maybe this dude is the reason for all the late evenings. And actually now that I think about it a lot of little wierd things are starting to make more sense. üòï I really dont like the direction this is heading. Am I reading to much into this?

AITA for sticking up for an ex instead of my girlfriend?,"Throwaway. My girlfriend and I are in a huge/ potentially relationship ending argument. I need to know if ITA. 

I'm in a very LDR with basically the girl of my dreams. Absolutely beautiful, smart, driven. Things have been great despite being a several hour plane ride away from each other. 

She came to town, and I was so pumped to introduce her to my friends. They threw a party, and while on the way, GF randomly asked ""are there any girls I should be worried about"" This is probably where I fucked up,  but I explained that a girl I used to see will likely be there. Explained that we were supportive of each other during our respective divorces, and we hadn't seen each other since well before I met GF. I was asked if we ever slept together. I said yes, because...we had. Also important to say that we never told out mutual friends about our fling, it wasn't a big deal. 

Everything started out great. Everyone was so welcoming to gf, including ex who was there with a new guy. 

GF gets drunk and made a comment about single moms dating being weird, almost directly after ex mentioned  her children. She randomly asked why she divorced ex husband...in front of everyone, and then asked, again in front of everyone, where we had gone on dates. I was honestly so surprised. So was everyone else. 

I apologized to ex and her guy as they were leaving, and she said ""no worries. Play 23 year old games, win 23 year old prizes"" (were all in our 30s) and gf heard this and sobbed in the bathroom for the rest of the night. She was so devastated that I didn't tell her that was out of line; however, I feel like nearly everything gf said to her was out of line. 

We got into the biggest argument about how I didn't have the decency to stand up for her. I told her honestly, I should have stood up for ex when gf relentlessly tried to embarrass her, and she can't be surprised at a little passive aggressiveness after the way she acted. 

She's now back on a plane, and we will ""discuss further"" once she clears her head.

Am I the asshole?

Edit for clarification: friends are all in our 30s, girlfriend is 23. 

Edit 2: update: I've gotten a ton of requests for an update, so here it is. I admitted that I'm an asshole for how I've gone about things, and how uncomfortable she must have been. I adore her, but I'm not comfortable with the default response being ""I'm jealous, I'm going to be rude to someone I don't know"" 

She is embarrassed and feels that those friends will always ""choose"" the other girl. I tried to explain that they would never choose, that they do love other girl (in their wedding, kid was a flower girl, etc) and that I can't do anything about that, but I do know that every person there has embarrassed themselves drunk in front of each other. Every one of them, and I definitely think she can recover. But she doubled down on the jealousy a bit, and the situation made us both realize that we glorify each other from a distance, and that it's probably not going to developed past this. 

For the record, neither me or the other girl have feelings for each other that aren't strictly platonic. Yes, I understand her comment was towards me. Plus, her new guy is a great guy, and really tried to make her (and everyone else) comfortable in an uncomfortable situation, guess I should take a page out of his book. ",AmItheAsshole
AITA for ruining jeans for women?,"I work at an office where I'm allowed to have a beard and long hair, but my manager is stringent on the ""no jeans policy."" She frequently ensures that no one is wearing jeans and is wearing professional attire. 

Problem is, for the past few months that I've been here, the women of the office have always worn jeans. Tight, dark, professional looking jeans, but jeans nonetheless. That is, until a few days ago. 

I love wearing jeans, and have always felt I could make them professional too. I was complaining about it to a friend and coworker when my manager walked into the staff room. She said something basically confirming her stance on jeans. 

I said ""Well, the girls get to wear jeans.""

""No they don't.""

Then, my coworker, Amanda walked in wearing jeans. I pointed that out. My manager confronted Amanda, telling her that she wasn't allowed to wear jeans. 

In the moment, Amanda appeared playfully mad at me. But I went over her house last weekend, and she brought up the incident twice, again sort of playfully, but I think she may actually be mad. I apologized, saying I didn't want to ruin jeans for women but to prove that someone can look professional in jeans. 

AITA?

EDIT/ UPDATE: Wow, did not expect all of the responses, though I can't say I'm surprised about the polarization. At work today, it wasn't bad.

Little sister (16) needs an abortion. Texas wants parental consent which we can't get. Can I take her to New Mexico?,"My sister is pregnant and she wants to get an abortion. In our home state (Texas) after talking to an abortion clinic it seems like they require one parent to be notified and consented. Our parents do not know about the pregnancy and will not consent, not in a million years.

So I guess the question is how much of a legal trouble would we be in if I took her to an abortion clinic in New Mexico? Which doesn't seem to require parental consent or notification. There is one less than two hours away, I can take her and being her back the same day, tell our parents that we were hanging at my place or went to a zoo or something.

Ideally they wouldn't ever know about it but let's assume they figure it out somehow, can I (or her) be in any legal trouble here?",legaladvice

TIFU by relaxing too much during a sensual massage,"Bit of back story. I started talking to a guy on Reddit last week. We hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. We decided to meet for a date on Friday. I have IBS and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. I was also very tired.

The FU: So I'm at this guy's house and I've made us a very nice Mac n Cheese. There was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. We're then snuggling on the sofa and I feel a big fart brewing. I'm hoping I can just absorb it back in to my body if I hold on to it long enough. 

We start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. I choose a 'relaxing' oil. I'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. He starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. I'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

I then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart I have ever expelled. The fart I was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. It was hella loud and it was hella long. And it was right on his balls. It was so forceful, they vibrated.

His response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'At least you didn't shit yourself'.

TLDR: Farted on a first date's balls.

Edit: For anybody interested, the mac n cheese is a very tasty recipe for those on a fodmap diet. You can replace pretty much all elements for low fodmap alternatives - gluten free pasta, lactofree milk and cheese, asafoetida for onion and garlic oil for garlic!",tifu

&#x200B;

Well, it's been like 12 days. The long and the short of it: The truth came out. Wedding has been put on hold while ""she gets help"" and I am left to pick up the mess and deal with everyone. I need a stiff drink and a vacation.

&#x200B;

A lot of people said some things that really struck with me. The photo of the stripper seemed to be odd, and you're right, it made no sense. Why would he take a picture that was so compromising? Why would he risk possible criminal charges if someone felt he went too far? How was he so cavalier? I sat her down and demanded the whole truth. We talked the night that I posted and we talked from 6ish until 3 or 4. We went moment by moment, step by step, and I demanded to know what happened. So, here's what *actually* happened:

&#x200B;

They got together for pre-fun cocktails and dinner but ate very little. They drank and drank and then had a hotel room booked as their base of operation from which they'd change and go to a club then crash at the end of the night. They got to the hotel and everyone was drunk. Instead of cooling their jets, they wanted to have more fun. Two of the bridesmaids suggested getting topless (one is a school teacher and the other is a surgical nurse...) and then my fiancees bright idea? *Get high.* But on what you might add? Oh, only painkillers she illicitly procured during her mother's final months and had been taking to help deal. Yeah, fucking lovely. My MIL had been on dilaudid, ativan and others. They all popped a pill, finishing the bottle and then the MoH's surprise - a stripper. So, who took the pills *and drank?* Only my future wife. Yeah, the rest of them realized that was a shit idea and instead just stuck to booze. It's why my fiancee was fall-down dumb and couldn't hold herself together. My fiancee doesn't drink, so I should have connected the dots there. That's on me I guess.

&#x200B;

The reality of the stripper is that they jumped around topless, drank and laughed while my fiancee was stoned and drunk. Stripper never fingered her. She kissed him then he kissed her neck and she hugged him but he was clear what the rules were and not only did he not touch her but they are pretty sure he ended things early and left to avoid a problem. The photo was a set-up and she was wearing underwear but not much else. She then admitted she would have fucked the stripper so that I would leave her. She said that she was mad at her mother for declining treatment early on and for her father for not pushing her into treatment earlier. She was mad at the whole situation and she began to take some pills. Then she was mad she was taking the pills and wanted to put distance between us. I couldn't figure out what pills she was taking until it dawned on me: near the end her mother was in pain and they gave her a prescription that made her really sick so another was issued. I thought the pills were destroyed but I guess my fiancee didn't do that - I had no reason to assume she would lie. In the years we've been together/known each other she's drank MAYBE 3 times and been really seriously drunk only once. I didn't think she'd do that.

So, that brings me to the texts. I ask her why, if she would have fucked that guy to hurt me, she didn't want me to know. She explained that she felt horrible guilt, didn't know what to do and realized it wasn't what she wanted and got scared that I was going to find out and leave her. Her MoH, who hired the stripper, wanted me to know about the drugs and thought she could scare her into telling me. Her bridal party were divided all wanted the wedding to proceed but half wanted her to disclose the pills she stole and the others didn't. By this point I didn't know what to do.

I followed advice given her and said we needed to delay the wedding. She began to panic and begged me not to. She started making bizarre fucking suggestions - we could do whatever I wanted for the next year and even offered to let me hit her to get back but begged me not to walk away from us. She then said she had a problem and needed help, Her dad is a nice guy but not emotionally all that available. She said that without me she'd be alone and that despite everything she loved me. That I don't actually doubt, I think she really does love me.

&#x200B;

So what happened?

&#x200B;

She saw her doctor on Monday who immediately used the words ""abuser"" and ""addict"" and strongly recommended blood tests, medical tests and a referral to a psychiatrist. We got the name of the doctor and I guess they move quickly because by the following day she was meeting with the psychiatrist. He recommended different types of therapy. We had a ""group meeting"" and he's said my wife is absolutely an addict - she was using the prescription pills and alcohol and my fiance admitted she had been drinking on the sly for some time. She's taken a leave from her work and is in group therapy sessions, meeting with a psychologist and recuperating by focusing on diet, exercise and self-improvement. We're down to one salary (mine) and absolutely cannot afford extras, so the wedding is currently on hold.

&#x200B;

This meant that I had to have very uncomfortable conversations with everyone, including my family, her family and our friends. Her father talked to me and told me that he feels terrible. He knows he has trouble being emotionally available and said that he wasn't really there for his daughter and felt horrible. My parents are well-to-do and helped with some bills that unexpectedly came in and have been helping a lot with everything. My fiancee has been going to my parent's house to work with my mother on gardening and to do other things around the house. The bridal party & maid of honor came to meet with me and bought me breakfast. They admitted that they suspected she had been taking the pills as she was a little looser with them and felt that the bachelorette party was a huge mistake. She drank way too much and they didn't stop her. I thanked them for their apology but said I didn't know what to say. They just offered their apologies and said that I was a great guy.

&#x200B;

The long-and-the-short of it is we're not sleeping in the same room. We aren't having sex. We are right now in this weird healing phase. Her team has recommended I see individual therapy which I haven't yet had the time to do. A lot of bills have come in and we've delayed the wedding - no rest for the wicked, I guess. My parents have been absolutely wonderful in all of this.

&#x200B;

Fiancee and I are in a weird place. She's overly nice and sympathetic. Since she's home, she cooks a lot more, focuses on tasks around the house and has been working hard on exercising. She submits to drug tests and we have a BACTrack if I'm concerned she's drinking. I'm a lot more aware of what's going on. She's attended a secular sobriety organization and meets with them. She's in group therapy and individual therapy.

&#x200B;

I kind of feel like I got shat on again and don't have a next move planned. People keep telling me to watch out for myself, but I'm not sure what to do.

&#x200B;

So that's what happened. I'm stunned and confused. Turns out people can really surprise you, and not always in a good way. I still love her and depending on how things go, we'll see about getting back to a place where we can think about a wedding. For now, I'm going to eat some bacon and try to enjoy the weekend.",relationship_advice

"Cousin confessed to falsely accusing my brother of rape. He was arrested, convicted and later committed suicide. I have her recorded confession. What should I do with it? (Arizona)","She accused him of rape years ago. She was 18 and he was 22. It was false and never happened. He was arrested and eventually convicted. When he served his stance and got out he was broken. From what he told me, he was heavily abused during his prison time by other prisoners. He tried to get back to his life and he couldn't. His record, his name on the registry and lack of options. He went from being a student in a top college in the country to having almost no prospects. Within a year of being out, he committed suicide.

Yesterday was 3 years since his death. This cousin sent word through a friend that she wanted to speak with me and seek my blessing on visiting my brother's grave. I said yes, but figured something doesn't seem right. I went and had a recorder with me and recorded the conversation. Also had my boyfriend record a video of our meeting from a distance (it was in public). She told me she's sorry and my brother didn't deserve what happened to him. I asked why and pressed her for an answer, she broke down and said she didn't know who did it and she accused him because he had refused to lend her money she desperately needed and she was angry at him.

The voice recorder got everything, and the video also has audio in parts that match the voice recorder perfectly.

Are these evidence useful in overturning that decision? I want to make my brother's slate clean. Not only for his memory but also because he has a son he never saw (his girlfriend was pregnant when this happened, he lost his parental rights as a result of this conviction). His son should know this is not the kind of man his father was. If so, how do we begin the process? Do we need a lawyer here, or do we need to go to the police?

What consequences (criminal) will she face? Will she go to jail?

And, does my brother's estate have a claim against her for damages? Of course this belongs to his son now although I don't know how that would work with respect to his parental rights being terminated (doesn't matter, as we'd want his son to be supported more than anything else). And can his son have a separate claim for damages against her? This conviction deprived him of a chance to know his father, because parental rights were terminated.

I know this won't bring my brother back but it can at least provide some comfort to us and to his son, and maybe making things more fair. So please help put me in the right direction.",legaladvice
TIFU by accidentally committing theft as a Police Officer in full uniform.,"Poilce don't seem super well liked on reddit but what the hell. This happened a few weeks ago.

I woke up one morning at 5:00 A.M. tired as fuck. I put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on TV or in a video game.

I started my normal routine: Got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best ""prepare for a police shift"" album of all time: ""The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST"". Now for my 15 minute commute to the city.

My vehicle was getting low on gas so I stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. I went in, put my Sausage, Egg, and Cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. Then I grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like I do as the beginning of every shift. After this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.

At about noon, I get a call from my Sergeant, who simply said ""I need to talk to you at the department.""

Oblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, I began heading to the police department. Millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. Upon my arrival, I was directed to my Lieutenant's office. When I walked in, I heard a stern, ""Close the door"". At this point I knew this wasn't good. I sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my Corporal. Sergeant, and Lieutenant.

After a preface from my Sergeant, he says, ""Tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.

I didn't say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. ""Aaawww.......shit. I forgot to pay for my burrito."" Then I just heard ""Guess what, that's theft.""

After a ""Come to Jesus"" moment with my superiors, I left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. They didn't want to press charges.

Although nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is I can't go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. All they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito. 

On a lighter tone, Now other officers have nicknamed me ""The Burrito Burglar"" and jokingly ask for tips on how to steal stuff when I see them.

Tl;dr: I'm a police officer. Walked into a gas station I go into every morning and, being in ""autopilot"" mode, I walked out with the same burrito I get every morning, and forgot to pay for it.",tifu

AITA For going off on a lady for calling the cops on me? WIB if I reported her?,"I'm black. My husband is white. He has a sister, who has a 3-year-old daughter who LOVES me, and who I think isn't too bad herself. My niece is equal parts terror and lovely, but mostly with me lovely. We hang out a lot to give my SIL a break, and my husband doesn't really ""get kids"" so it's often 1x1. 

I was out with my niece at a kid's playplace/mall for kids, and she was more terror than lovely. She was defiant, and I'm all about consequences after two warnings. She kept running from me laughing her butt off, so I told her it was time to go. Normally she'll go quietly but this time, filled with vim, vigor and grape juice, she pitched a GIGANTIC fit so I had to carry her. She wasn't screaming in a ""WHO IS THIS HELP ME"" way but in a clearly understandable ""NO, I WANT TO STAY AND PLAY. AUNTIE(ME), NO"" way. But also she's 3, so maybe if you're not used to her it's not clear. 

As we're leaving, a lady stops us asking if everything's okay. I smiled at her, and told her yes, that we just had to get home for a nap. She then got in my face like ""Do you KNOW this child."" I'm wrangling a screaming toddler, so I just said yes and tried to step around her. She then said, ""you're not leaving until you prove you know that child."" I told her, it's fine, we're related (my niece now was calm and holding me), she's just acting b-r-a-t-t-y and she said like, ""No mother would EVER say that about her kid"". Yeah, maybe. But she can't spell so. She then demanded I give her my niece, or call someone to confirm my identity. 

I was pissed. I told her I don't have to prove anything to her and I'm leaving with my kid. She then literally RAN  to security, screaming that a kid's being kidnapped. Cops called. Security guy asks what's up. I was polite to him but I told the lady off. I said it's way too damn *present day* to be act like  mixed race children, or blended family don't exist, and to IMMEDIATELY jump to kidnapping was insane. The cops showed, and they asked my niece who I am ""AUNTIE (ME)!"" and I showed them some pictures of us together in clearly different settings, they apologized, reprimanded her. It's done. 

She  works somewhere in the complex, but not where we were. I want to report it. She'd been watching us and saw my niece and I hanging for at LEAST 30 minutes familiarly. So while I could have showed her the pictures, I didn't feel like I needed to. It's not her job and in fact the person whose job it was apologized to me as we left. Now, I have had this happen before, and someone is a little sketched. I'm polite, it becomes obvious that she knows me, and they drop it. I just had flashforwards to a time when my niece might pull the ""THIS ISN'T MY MOM"" card. And then I really WOULD need the cops to be called because I'd kill her.

I have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  In my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions I rarely see him.  It has been about a year and a half since I have seen him and I was surprised to see him in my area today.  He has lost about a hundred pounds so I thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  I said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  He responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  We aren't incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which I was completely expecting as I awkwardly stood in the hallway.  

When I got back into my office I brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  My office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.

My mother posted a photo of another girl in her Facebook post when she was wishing me happy birthday.,"I know social media is toxic and I barely use it.

Yesterday was my birthday and I got tagged in a post so I checked it out and my mother posted a photo of another girl in her graduation photos parading it around like it was me on Facebook.( more than one post)

I am feeling hurt and upset since we just took a trip together and took so many wonderful pictures together, it was a special time for me and it makes me sad that she used someone else's photos instead of a photo of me to wish me a happy birthday.

When I pointed it out to her (publicly on the post) she just posted ""lol I'm getting old"" but this hurts so much because the girl is fat like I am we don't look alike at all. the girl in the picture is darker skinned than I am has black hair (mine is dyed blonde) and the girl is in her cap and gown (I haven't finished my education yet)

I feel as though she wants me to be this girl she saw pictures of instead of being me. I don't feel loved and I asked her to take down the post but she hasn't yet.

Am I being unreasonable? Am I overreacting? I think my mom should know what I look like. Am I being insecure of immature about this situation?

Edit 1: She deleted the post and has not said a word to me.

Edit 2: I called her to thank her for taking it down. She said very shortly, ""I can post a picture of a flower or something and you won't get upset I pick that picture because I want you to graduate soon"" and then hung up on me.",relationship_advice

Update. My parents joined a new age cult and tried to drag me to a compound against my will.,"Since [my last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ccd4vh/fl_my_parents_have_joined_some_new_age_religion/) got popular and people still seem interested in my situation I thought I would give you guys a update on everything. It's been over a month and i'm sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn't the best idea to rant about it online till I felt ready. Well, now that i'm settled down a bit I feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. Sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says I should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though I know the group now I won't be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).

&#x200B;

So after I stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. My dad said not to go so I somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and I would come home that night. This plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. It didn't take long before my mom caught on that I was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  My mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because I had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. My friends parents called the police and I called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. I'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.

&#x200B;

My mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. In the end my dad made it so I would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. I stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. My mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: My step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month I was coming no matter what. 

&#x200B;

After a week of this, everything changed. My mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. Me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. My sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. During this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  After this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200B;

She proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". All to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand I was being used by evil.""During these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn I was."" According to her I am a ""evil seed"" and that I not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". I also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. She told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. She ended by telling me that I was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". The last contact I know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

&#x200B;

At the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. I moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. Things are still pretty raw right now and I really don't feel like getting into the emotions I feel towards this. But I feel like at least updating this may be a start.

TIFU by telling my friend to go ahead and send a picture,"This happened 1 week ago. I'm a man, my best friend is a woman. It was before class and I had my laptop opened up to chat... 

She had said to me, for whatever reason, ""do you wanna see me eat this taco?""

And I, being open to and accepting of her antics, replied ""do I ever!""

After a few minutes of nothing back, I went up to ask the professor a question. While the professor was explaining something to me I noticed a very dramatic flurry of reactions from those seated around my computer screen.

Now, my friend is great but she is also wildly inappropriate and I knew immediately that she had sent something super weird... Everyone was staring and laughing at me. One guys was smiling and nodding. I could feel my whole head turning beat red as I took the long walk back to my seat.

When I got back my heart lurched as I saw that what she had actually sent was essentially a picture of her deepthroating a burrito while looking directly into the camera... To make matters worse, she had typed ""YOU PERVERT"" across the top in big blue letters, so there was no possible way to interpret it as anything else... I was horrified. How do you explain to your classmates the kind of friendship dynamic that leads up to you getting pictures like that?

After that point there was no coming back, every single thing I did or said somehow seemed to confirm in everyone's mind that I am just some weirdo dude who gets girls to send him pictures of them choking on food... I am still super embarrassed and probably will be until this class is over.

TL;DR: My friend sent me a weird and suggestive photo that my entire class saw and now everyone thinks I get off to girls stuffing food down their throat.

Edit: Wow gee thanks guys I was hoping by sharing this amusing story that I would be made to question all my feelings. Simply grand!

AITA for giving my ex wife a large amount of money I won despite the anger of my gf?,"I recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. I won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. It makes me feel funny even typing It's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

My ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. She is an amazing woman and good to the bone. We divorced 6 years ago because I had an affair with my current partner. I was in a low place in my life and I fucked up. She was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that I know she was hurting. She still is close with my parents. She is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

She was actually the first person I phoned after my mom and pops after I found out I won the lottery. She was pleased for me, joked that I could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. Nothing else. as soon as I won, I knew I wanted to give her a significant amount. I still love her. She's the mother of my babies and I feel like this is some small tiny way I can show her that I'm not a complete fuck up. She deserves to know that I care despite my mistakes. She also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. Give our kids a better life between us. I haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but I have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

Long story short, when I told my gf, she was my livid. Screaming that I'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- I'm not *in* love with her. We've both grown apart, but of course I still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. My gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh I'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. I don't plan on changing my plans, but AITA?

AITA for walking out of my own birthday.,"so my birthday was 3 days ago, mum asked me last month my plans for it and I said that I would love for me mum dad and brother to go to a nice restaurant and have dinner, she agreed and thought it was a great idea. 
I made a point of saying that all I want is us to celebrate ny birthday and I do not want anyone else to join us. 

I get a text from my mum to tell me to get to her place at 5 (this was 2 days ago) and so I got ready and headed off. I get to the house and noticed that the lights where all off but walked in anyways. all I hear is SURPRISE and around 20/30 people leap out to surprise me. 
when I looked around the room I noticed that most of the people who where there where not my friends but my mums friends, like people from her church and job. 

I looked quite shocked and pulled mum to the side and told her how much I did not want this and asked her why her colleagues and friends were at MY birthday party, she claimed that she wanted more people to surprise me. so I asked if we were going to head to the restaurant and she told me that we would be having a bbq here. 

I said nope and walked out the door got in my car and drove home  

I ruined the party and my mum has been a trainwreck.

People who commit suicide by jumping in front of trains/buses/cars etc are the worst type of asshole.,"Suicide is a real issue. It's a worldwide issue. People kill themselves for many different reasons and it's tragic.

My heart goes out to the people suffering so badly they want it all to end. My heart goes out to their families and friends. 

But if you jump in front of a train (or any vehicle driven by others) to end it all you're a piece of shit. 

You want to kill yourself that's your business. I wish you didn't feel you had to and I wish you felt you could get help. But don't completely fuck up others lives! How dare you destroy the life of the innocent drivers and lives of their passengers for your selfish desire to end your own!

End of the day you don't care. You're dead. The living have to try and put their lives together and go on. You don't.

But fuck you. Asshole.

Edited to fix spelling.

Edit to add:

I didn't expect this to blow up like it did.

To those people saying I don't know what it's like to be suicidal or I'm underestimating the pain,
I don't underestimate. I've been there.

I'm not saying people who kill themselves in this manner are  annoying ME persay, I'm saying their actions by killing themselves in that manner can potentially fuck up the lives of strangers. Innocent people like the bus driver just doing his job. The kid going to school. The person struggling with their own mental demons. 

How is that not selfish?

How is that not wrong?

It's terrible when people feel they need to end it all. Some, like me, get help or pull themselves through it. Some don't and that's tragic. 

But yes I get upset when innocents suffer because of the actions of one. I've seen it too many times not to get upset. 

So I make no apologies for my opinion other than to say perhaps the aggression and swearing could have been worded better and still got the point across. 

If you choose to think I'm an asshole well that's ok. Thank you all for your comments good and bad. It's certainly made me think reading them and has opened my eyes.

If you are struggling yourself I wish you all the best. The world is better with you in it.",unpopularopinion
"Matched with girl on tinder. Profile said 18, got phone number, she calls and reveals she's 10.","I blocked her and the texts were super short and completely non sexual. She randomly calls me and I was like shit she sounds super young. I text her and ask if she's 18. She said yes. Later she texts me and said she was lying. She FaceTimes me and she's in fucking kid pajamas and says she's 10 and calls me stupid. 

This is dangerous. What can I do to notify her parents ?  It is an ATT number. Should I call them? 



Edit : I looked up the number on social media. Nothing. I reported it to tinder using their online form. 

She used fake pictures of course. I could certainly tell a 10 year old from an 18 year old. I will not be notifying parents or local agencies of any kind. I reported it to tinder and that's all I will do. Some parents think their children are perfect and could twist the blame on me instead of themselves. The second she said she was 16 (before she admitted she was 10) I hung up and reported the profile, and unmatched. She revealed she was 10 while I was in the process of blocking the number. 

Even before she said she was under 18 I said absolutely zero things that wouldn't be okay to say to a ten year old, so I know I'm in the clear. I believe there's zero case to be made for any sort of enticing or anything like that. ",NoStupidQuestions
TIFU by giving my 19 year old Puggle the fat off my t-bone steak,"this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. 

on mobile so forgive me for my sins. 

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he's been my best friend my whole life cause I'm 22. so he's all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, I was cleaning my T-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. I thought, ""man, Buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so I proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. I proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (QUICKLY for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so I didn't expect this, but I suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. I'm watching him eat it cause I'm all stoked he's enjoying himself & feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk Irishman.   I instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so I grab the fucker & tug it out. he's unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. I'm FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. so i start giving him CPR. (I don't know how to do CPR for humans, let alone a dog, but I gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day I die. he lays there for a second & I rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug I gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat I ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. I monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. I gave him some love & he went to sleep. 

my life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us. 

TL;DR I brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat.

edit; wow, thank you for the silver, kind stranger ;-;

edit; this post blew up. thank you so much for all the love, very pleased to know so many enjoyed.

TIFU by getting Google to ban our entire company while on the toilet,"**TLDR; Company uses Google accounts that are all connected. I fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the Google account, and ALL associated accounts. Everyone in my company is now blocked by Google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. Google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

Preface, this happened on Friday and is still on-going. I've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so I won't be outed since I guarantee someone will read this eventually. I still do not know if I am the culprit, but I am 90% sure that I am. I feel like this is a fireable offence and I will step up and take it if it comes to that. I'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

I work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. We migrated to Gmail and other Google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. It's safe to say that everyone is using Gmail or Google in one way or another. Now, our Gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. Keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

I have a friend who creates Android apps on the side. I do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called Titanium Backup. 

As a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), I buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. After that, I send him an e-mail with the cloned version through Gmail with something along the lines of: ""Look at this cool app I found on the store, it was completely free! Try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. It was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

Recently he uploaded a new app and I did the same thing as usual. I was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. I was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. I e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

About an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their Google accounts. At the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

One of my colleagues requested help and I went to check it out. It turns out that their account was blocked by Google due to ToS violations. Their Google Payments account was blocked as well. I thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. We got banned by Google, all of us. 

The afternoon was pandemonium. We were all freaking out, our IT guys were trying to get a hold of Google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. We could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. All our work was shared with Google services.

Eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. It wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. Anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. One of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

Anyways, we were all told to go home on Friday. I went home and looked this up myself, and I found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the Google Payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. It bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how I said all our work accounts were connected?

Yeah...

So it's been two days now and we've been chatting over Skype, no one knows what happened and the IT guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that Google isn't helping us out. Their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. The posts I've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since Google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

So yeah, that's that. I'm 99% sure that I am the culprit who caused this. I do not know why Google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from Google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. I might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**EDIT1:** This blew up pretty quickly. Luckily, I have 3 PMs from people close to, or reps who can help me out. If I missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. I am in touch with one of them now and I am getting in touch with IT at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. I will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out. ",tifu
TIFU I said no to my Gf's proposal.,"WARNING: THIS IS A LONG ONE. SCROLL DOWN TO THE TL;DR IF YOU DON'T WANT THE FULL STORY. 

Yeah... I f***ed up today. See, I've been dating my GF (K) for 5 years. We are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. I've wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. The reason I haven't is that about 2 years ago, I got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. 

It's been VERY rough on the two of us, but K has stuck with  me every step of the way. My disease, GPA, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. I'm starting drugs that haven't been FDA approved for my condition. All other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. This new drug is promising, but hasn't been guaranteed to work. I'm terrified to say the least. All of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. 

I want to be healthy and stable before I even think about marriage. I don't want to leave K as a widow with no support! K & I had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that I needed to go into remission first. We agreed to it, or so I thought. Flash foreword to a few hours ago and K is with MY FAMILY in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. 

I saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. I immediately started freaking out. First thought: I haven't even gone into remission yet and I have no clue if I'm going to get better. I cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren't working. What if I die from all of this? Second thought: GODDAMN IT DAD! Why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!

I guess I'm coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my Dad was a very involved parent when I was young. When I entered High-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. The expectations would get so high that I couldn't live up to them. Similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. Both my brothers and I find this to be a real problem, if my Dad is left unchecked. I would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. Back to the story!

Anyway, I'm freaking out. I just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. Sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of ""no-nno waaay!"" With my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, I ran out of the building... I made the love of my life cry as I selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. I've never felt so ashamed in my life... After calming down, I talked to my Mother, and drove back to talk to K.

In the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. Tears were shed and things were said. K told me I was being selfish. ""We've been dating for years, who cares if you die, I want to marry you!"" She also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. She understood why I would be paranoid about my dad though. K understands that my Dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn't include them.

In the end, we reconciled. We made up, decided that I was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn't forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. We came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. We want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.

Now I'm engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if I do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, I'll be with my best friend/lover. K is my world, and I'm an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. 

Thanks for listening.



TL;DR
I said no when my GF proposed bc I'm on chemo and don't know if I'm gonna go into remission or die. Decided I was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.

Nuclear power is infinitely better than anything we currently have and people need to stop fear mongering,"People think of Chernobyl and automatically discredit nuclear energy because they dont want that to happen again, although nuclear energy is much safer than it was decades ago.

The breakthroughs that nuclear power could unlock if it was adopted worldwide would be enormous, we could basically solve the worldwide power shortage overnight and have so much left over that we could advance other renewable energies 10 times faster.

On top of that, I had to put down my beloved fur child last Saturday, so as expected, he hasn't really been putting his wand in my Chamber of Secrets..if you catch my drift.

After an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in Conan O'Brien's words, ""take grandma to Applebee's."" It's been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. As in, I felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. When I was cleaning myself up after, I noticed just how much was coming out of me and when I told him he laughs it off and says,"" Haha, yeah, that was a lot.""

Anyways, this morning I check my calendar and of course I have a gyno appointment. I'm the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, I completely forget about last nights sexscapade. 

Fast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. I guess my gyno was training a Physician's Assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. 

For the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner Sasha Grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists' viewing pleasure. They then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. Ya know, nothing's better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified vag while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.

Anyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. My experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions (keep in mind that he was not behind her but was to my left). Midway he stops, walks over to take a quick look, smirks, and goes,"" Do you finally have a bf?"" (It's worth noting that he's a really cool gyno and obviously, I must talk to him about my sex life every check up; at this point, I wasn't sure if he had actually seen the semen inside me or was just making small talk). I awkwardly answer ""yes"" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. The new PA still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. That's the EXACT moment that my soul leaves my body. As she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, I see my boyfriend's freaking baby batter DRIPPING off this thing into the floor. Once the speculum was removed, I proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. Yes, I was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. 

The poor PA looks at my gyno and asks,"" Did you want me to clean that?,"" referring to what dripped on the floor. Before he could answer, I made a strange ass sound and rushed out,"" It's okay, I'll do it.""

Before they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,"" Guess your dry spell is finally over!"" We speak casually like friends so I'm not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.

Guys.. I am seriously fucking horrified. What the fuck. I'm seriously considering switching gyno's but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. 

Also, not using a throwaway because I have no shame.

TL;DR: Boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me.

EDIT: For those of you suggesting that this is an April Fools joke.. it is unfortunately not. My dignity is in shambles but I'm glad a few of you were able to laugh, cry, and cringe with me.

Also, yes, I did shower. My after-sex routine always involves a shower where I proceed to push my pelvic floor muscles like I am a reborn Christian, trying to expel the demon spawn that my sinful boyfriend had pushed into me. Although a hefty amount DID come out last night, apparently, not all of it. Contrary to popular belief, cooter's are not wide, gaping holes, with lips that flap whenever there's a breeze. Washing the outside of your vagina does not clean the INSIDE which, if you're not dipping your 'nana into the Nutella jar, is where the semen goes. A pap smear looks at the inside of the vagina and a speculum is an instrument that basically spreads open the walls of your tight vagina so the gynecologist can get a better look at your cervix.

In my case, just like ~~Noah~~ Moses, that speculum split the waves and onto the path that was just formed, onward gushed my beloved boyfriend's high fructose porn syrup. 

EDIT 2: For those that don't believe this is true.. or that I am female (grrls don't use the the interwebz hurrhurr), here are the screenshots of me talking to my boyfriend after.

EDIT 3: For those that STILL don't believe me:

Also, please don't speak badly about my gynecologist. You may think it's unprofessional but I've been seeing him for years now (prior to my bf, I was single for 3 years and I'm not one to partake in one night stands) and we're really close. As part of a regular check up for STD screening, he always asked if I have engaged in any sexual activity and for three years, I'd say no then tell him how much I longed for a relationship. If this happened in one of our first appointments, he would have NEVER acted like this. I have PCOS/am high risk for cervical cancer so I am constantly there for testing, ultrasounds, and general check ups regarding birth control/Metformin/etc. (we're still working on a method to regulate my period). He's become really close to me and we always joke around because it eases my nerves. It took us a while to get as comfortable as we are with each other and I wouldn't change it for the world. Though it'll always be nerve wracking to see any kind of physician ESPECIALLY a gynecologist, for me, it really helps that I view him as a friend. 

To clarify, bf and I had sex around 3am last night, I cleaned up, then we went to bed. Today (or I guess yesterday since it's 12:33am right now), was my day off so I legitimately woke up and Netflixed in bed all day until around 1 pm since my appointment was at 2.

Believe me or not, that's up to you. All I'm saying is I swear on my beloved fur baby's soul that it happened and I am still super embarrassed. In the years that I've been his patient, I have never seen this young female PA before. I do not know if this was the first time she encountered a situation like this but from the look on her face, I can only guess. I'm sure she'll become seasoned in time and things like this wil not phase her. The PA gave me my pap smear and I had to come back in a week to get an ultrasound for my PCOS anyway so if results were unclear due to semen, I'm sure we will redo the pap smear. My appointment was at 2pm but I was not seen until 3pm due to him having an emergency regarding a patient to attend to at the hospital so the exam was very rushed since he had a full waiting room. However, I'll be sure not to have PiV sex for at least 48 hours prior (very thankful for this advice as I genuinely did not know and this was my first visit where I am in a relationship ever).

I honestly was NOT expecting this to blow up like this in anyway.. I never even really post on Reddit, hence not using a throwaway since nobody knows I have this account *shrugs*. I guess this will become my ""throwaway"" account now since all this attention is making me a bit uncomfortable.

Some of you are criticizing my writing style and that's okay. I decided to have some fun with this post since it honestly was an awkward situation. I also happen to be a fan of euphemisms and personally challenged myself to use as many as I could. Sorry to those that felt it was hard to read or cringey and thanks to those that light heartedly laughed with me. I appreciate all of you - both the bad and good comments.

It was nice feeling semi-popular for one day, as things have been pretty gloomy around here ever since my dog died but some of your comments have really brightened my day.

TIFU by not realizing cheese isn't supposed to hurt you,"I guess this is three decades in the making but I only discovered it Saturday, so it feels like a very fresh FU.

This weekend I was eating a sandwich with some extra sharp parmigiano-reggiano cheese flakes on it and I made the comment over voice chat with my friends that it was so good but so sharp it was tearing up my mouth. I had a momentary pause before a chorus of puzzled friends chimed in at the same time to ask me to elaborate.

""You know, it's extra sharp. It really cuts and burns my gums and the roof of my mouth.""

And that's when my friends informed me that none of them have this reaction, and futhermore, *no one* has this reaction. I hear several keyboards going at once with people having alt-tabbed to google around and our best webmd-style guess is that I have an allergic reaction to some histamines common in sharp cheeses, and that I've had this reaction for *thirty years*, and that I always assumed *everyone* had it. 

""What the hell do you mean when you call it a *sharp* cheese if THAT'S not what you're talking about?!""

I figured the mild-sharp spectrum for cheeses was like the mild-hot spectrum for spicy foods. I love spicy foods. I love sharp cheeses. I thought they were the same kind of thing where they were supposed to hurt you a little bit. Apparently ""sharp"" just means ""flavorful"" or ""tangy.""

TL;DR: I have an allergy to some cheese protein and for 30 years I've been thinking that sharp cheese is supposed to sting.",tifu
[Update] Blind furry sexually harassing me at work. [FL],"https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8zaehq/blind_furry_sexually_harassing_me_at_work_fl/

Sorry for another update so soon, not good news. I'm an idiot. 

Last night I called one of the numbers provided to me and spoke to one of the employee assistance people, who assured me that they'd get back to me.

I had a short shift this morning, and he came in right at the start, which he often does. I bought a mini spiral notebook at the dollar store and recorded the time and exactly what he said/did as someone told me to do a few minutes after he left when there was a lull in people coming in, and my manager came and saw and asked me what I was doing. He didn't press me or anything but I was dumb and told him what was happening and that I was just recording it ""just in case"" (again I've already told him about that customer and he basically ignored the problem and told me to do that too). He didn't comment on it at the time beyond saying ""Oh"".

I woke up from a nap less than an hour ago and just checked my texts and he sent me a text telling me not to come into work tomorrow and that my services wouldn't be needed anymore. I'm freaking the hell out. I won't be able to find another part-time job that fits my schedule, I won't be able to move out of this fucking town. I feel like I'm going to puke. I'm so pissed at that dude and my manager and myself for not doing the notebook later. 

I was told to edit this to formally add a question or I wouldn't receive advice? I mean, just what's the best thing to do from here. Thought it was obvious I meant that, sorry. Thanks.

TIFU by saying I was tired to my wife.,"Came home from the gym. Its leg day. Had full day at work too. Work isn't bad. Came home to happy kids. Wife does a great job at keeping them alive. The best.

Wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. I do not dispute this since I am not a total moron. Kids are exhausting but totally worth it. I tell her as much. She is most tired. I am only kind of tired. Not good enough. She is more tired. I agree with this in order to ease the tension. Unsuccessful.

I'm not talking posts or comments that are ""MAGA"", I'm talking about opinions that differ slightly from the narrative. Anything that offers a slightly different viewpoint or may point blame in any way to the circlejerk.  

/r/politics is breeding a new generation of rhetoric. They've normalized calling dissidents and people offering varying opinions off the narrative as  Nazi's, white supremacists, white nationalists, dangerous, bots, trolls and the list goes on.  

They've made it clear that they think it's okay to harrass, intimidate and hurt those who disagree with them.

This behaviour is just as dangerous as what /r/the_donald was doing during the election. The brigading, the abuse, the harrassment but for some reason they are still allowed to flood /r/popular and thus the front page with this dangerous rhetoric.  

I want /r/politics to exist, but in it's current form, with it's current moderation and standards, I don't think it has a place on the front page and I think at the very least it should be renamed to something that actually represents it's values and content because at this point having it called /r/politics is in itself misleading and dangerous.

Also not white nor a fascist nor Russian. 

It's still my opinion that /r/politics should be at the very least renamed to something more appropriate like /r/leftleaning or /r/leftpolitics or anything that is a more accurate description of the subreddit's content. /r/the_donald is at least explicitly clear with their bias, and I feel it's only appropriate that at a minimum /r/politics should reflect their bias in their name as well if they are going to stay in /r/popular

I think my (31/M) girlfriend (26/f) cheated on me and stole my money.,"We have been dating for around 2 years now.

Friday night, one of my friends called me and told me he was watching my girlfriend kissing another guy at one of the bars in the area. It's a place her and I don't really frequent, but many of my friends go there on the weekends. Since it was crowded, he didn't think she saw him. Apparently a little while later, his girlfriend shows up there and sees my girlfriend hanging with this guy they don't recognize, then watching as they kiss again. She never came home Saturday morning, ended up coming back around 1 in the afternoon.

There is no reason either of them would lie to me, I've been friends with the guy since 6th grade and with his girlfriend since they started dating 4 years ago. Both super nice people.

I confronted my girlfriend about it last night and she freaked, calling them liars, calling me manipulative, and (after initially denying there was another guy) calling the other guy ""just a friend"". I went to work about an hour later and came home a few hours ago. All of her stuff is gone, which is fine with me because I don't believe her and I think she was cheating. Worse though, she took MY fire safe which contains an emergency credit card, about $700 in cash, my social security card, my passport and the title to my truck.

My boyfriend hit me in a fight. Is this who he is? [UPDATE],"Last post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/djf9pq/my_boyfriend_hit_me_during_an_argument_is_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

I greatly appreciate the support that I received on my initial post. Some of you asked me to update and I've decided that I would. 

There was a lot of concern about the possibility that I might have broken ribs from the assault. Upon going to the doctor and getting x-rays, I found out that while I suffered no breaks, he did bruise my ribs. Essentially I was told to rest and it should improve within 4-6 weeks. It still hurts to do just about anything involving movement. Deep breaths feel like a knife in my side. I'm tempted to get a second opinion if it continues being this bad. My doctor didn't ask many questions about how I obtained my injures. I told him that I had a fall and he seemed to accept that story. 

I told my family what had happened shortly after going to the doctor. They came the following day to move me out of our flat. It was one of the most difficult things I've ever done, but I am grateful to have them to get me through everyday. My parents were just as shocked as I was to learn that my ex boyfriend was capable of something so awful. They have urged me to file a report despite my decision not to. I do not want to go through that process. It's been a terrible ordeal that I want in the past. If I'm honest perhaps there might be some loyalty to him inside me that doesn't want him in jail. We have taken photos of my injuries and saved texts (I'll get to that momentarily) should I need them in the future.

We explained the situation to my former landlord who was unexpectedly sympathetic. She let us break our lease without excess penalty other than keeping the deposit. 

My ex boyfriend had been trying to get in contact with me from the day I asked him to leave. Endless phone calls and text messages that I never answered. His texts included apologies as well as promises to get help. I ended up calling him to tell him that I had moved out. To my surprise he didn't fight me. He agreed that it was for the best though he was clearly heartbroken. We have both completely moved now and I have no intention on contacting him further. 
 
I'm trying to be strong, but in my darkest moments I miss him. I miss my life. I miss waking up to and going to bed with my best friend. I miss talking to him. I miss the love we had for 3 years. I miss the person that I used to be; confident and brave. I'm fucking scared all the time now. I'm scared that I'll never be able to trust anyone in the same way I trusted him. I miss not being in pain. I'm angry at him for ruining everything and angry at myself for not seeing the signs. I alternate between being in utter denial to despair. This has been the worst experience of my life that sometimes feels like it's impossible I'll ever smile again. 

Don't worry about me taking him back. Telling my family cemented that that will never happen. As for the rest of it, I don't know.

Update to this post.

The comments helped me calm down a little, I really needed that. I was really stressing tf out. And yeah I know I'm stupid, didn't really think my actions through.. I did went back to her soon after my post and well, we cried hah. We've both had a lot of time to think and we've met everyday to talk, and we're pretty much 100% certain what's going to happen. So she revealed that she wants a relationship and be exclusive with me and asked me to seriously think about it, and that she wanted to know what I wanted before making a decision. And well yeah, I pretty much realized I don't know why we're NOT dating.. Lots of common interests. Always lots of fun together and the same sense of humor. Good chemistry in general. But I honestly thought I was only interesting as a FWB to her, because of our age difference. But apparently (lucky me) not. So I told her I want to be with her too, and after lots of discussion we agreed to go for an abortion.

 One thing she said stood out for me. She is serious about us, and wants to make it this work. And starting off with a child this early in the relationship is going to be very tough, so the chance that our relationship will survive is slim, and she doesn't want to take that risk. And she didn't plan on having kids for a few more years, and obviously I feel the same way. So yeah who knows maybe she or I will change our mind but this is the plan for now. Luckily abortion is legal in my country. Thanks for the advice everyone. On one hand I'm ridiculously happy that I'm now officially with her, like I honestly thought that wasn't a possibility.  But yeah the situation kinda sucks. And yes we'll be using condoms..",relationship_advice

AITA for getting upset that my sister's fianc√© pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?,"The title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

I'm 24 and I'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

I used and used until I was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

She's my best friend and I know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

She also met her fianc√© two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. He's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much I put my sister through. 

Despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because I am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

When I get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

When I walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure I ""didn't bring anything in"".  I instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't I, and I tell him not to touch me. 

He tells me to ""calm down"" and that if I want to be here then he needs to do this. I tell him he's being ridiculous and I try to push past him. He stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" I told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

At this point I'm getting more and more angry and I'm practically yelling in his face at this point. Bystanders came between us and separated us and told my BIL to just ""drop it."" He said he would but that ""they can deal with it when I get out of hand.""

I just went to go find a seat after that. 

After the reception, a lot of my family told me that I should've let him just do it and that I was acting like a huge asshole and like I had ""something to hide."" 

I don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and I don't think my reaction was over the top. If anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. My sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"AITA for sending my kid to school with ""adult"" snacks and lunches?","Living a healthy lifestyle is important to me, and it's important to pass it onto my kids as well. I have a second grader who I have brought up (so far) to be very involved in the kitchen, what we eat, diet and exercise. 

She came home with a note from her teacher the other day asking to please send her with more ""appropriate"" snacks and lunches. I thought for a minute that maybe I accidentally grabbed one of my Quest Bars or something for her and asked my daughter.

For her morning snack, all the other kids had something like cookies, fruit by the foot/gummy snacks, etc. My daughter's absolute favorite snack ever is pickles, and she has said herself that she's never that hungry at snack time because we have a nice high protein breakfast, I put in a cut up pickle for her along with a babybel cheese in case she *was* hungry. The teacher commented on it.

Lunchtime came around, and I guess a similar thing happened. My kid goes nuts for anything spicy, so for lunches this week I made a cold spicy sesame noodle dish with lots of peanuts, shaved carrots, etc. Her friend wanted to sample it so she gave some to her friend, and I guess it was crazy spicy for the friend and she cried to the teacher. This is what sparked the note. 

So I explained that she shouldn't share ""spicy"" foods with her friends, and figured I'd skip the pickles next time. Well, it wasn't good enough. Just yesterday, the teacher sent home a letter to everyone explaining that she's requesting we make sure to send ""age appropriate"" foods to school, and gave examples of things like a PB & J, snack pack pudding, fruit cups, etc.

I called the teacher and asked her about the note. Teacher became very judgmental and said to please just remember my daughter is ""a little kid"" and that she doesn't need to worry about eating ""adult food"" yet. I asked if there was some kind of school policy about this, and she became very icy and said ""No"" and ""This really shouldn't be a big deal.""

This might be where I fucked up. I told the teacher that I'm the parent, and there's nothing wrong with my child's diet. That when she (the teacher) has kids, she can feed what she might she'd like, but that unless there's some kind of school policy, I will continue to send my kid to school with the foods I pick. Teacher got huffy and hung up.

"Young people need to be taught that emotions can be deceiving, and don't necessarily reflect the state of reality. I think this is what has truly created the generation of snowflakes.","Pretty much title. 

Young kids growing up need to learn that their emotions don't always tell the truth, and that just because you feel a certain way, doesn't mean that your emotion is warranted. Just because you feel disrespected doesn't mean you are, just because you feel angry doesn't mean you're right, etc. 

We need to focus on educating our kids about taking emotion out of it, and using rationale instead to come to conclusions.

Edit: I'd also like to say this applies to positive emotions. Just because you like something, or feel good about something, or feel righteous about something, doesn't mean that that thing is good or positive. The Nazi's were enthusiastic about Hitler.",unpopularopinion

[CO] My retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. I fear that she intends to abuse other children and I want to stop it. I have proof of her abuse against me. How do I go about this?,"Between the ages of 9-11, I took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. If memory serves, I believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that I took lessons with her. The only reason I stopped going to her was because she retired. 

My teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". I won't get into specifics, but I have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

I never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

Recently, I found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. I am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and I want to stop it before it's too late.

So my question is: legally, what can I do and what should my course of action be? I don't want money, I just want her stopped.

I have the photographs, but I am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

Please walk me through this, because I genuinely don't know what to do, and I'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because I didn't stop it sooner.

TIFU by misunderstanding the ugly duckling,"The other night, I was out getting a drink with some friends from university, and for some reason or another, the conversation turned to swans.

Now, as a kid, I remember reading the Ugly Duckling - and for some reason, I completely misunderstood it. Not the lesson of the story or anything, but the reason that the duckling was ugly in the first place. The reason being that it was, of course, a swan.

But for some reason, I got a few wires crossed, and thought it was in fact a duckling like the rest. Instead of thinking that the swan was a different kind of bird, I thought that swans were just male ducks. For some reason I never stopped thinking it, even though I've seen plenty of ducks, and literally had the differences between male and female ones pointed out to me before. I don't know why it never got through to me. I guess I just thought they were different kinds of duck or something.

What this means is that when one of my friends mentioned something about female swans, I scoffed and very loudly proclaimed that ""you can't have female swans"". I stuck by this, convinced they were fucking with me, until they realised I wasn't kidding.

And that's how I, at the age of 19, finally learned that female swans exist. My friends won't stop laughing at me over it, and I really have no defence other than it made sense at the time.

TL;DR I didn't think swans could be female, my friends won't let me live it down.",tifu

1.

Mispronounced my new girlfriend's name when I introduced her to old friends of mine.

2.

Dropped an F bomb during an important job interview when I accidentally bit my own tongue.

3.

Ignored my broken tooth for weeks and ended up in hospital with inflamed and infected gums. 

4.

Changed my Instagram name to @onetruegenuis and realized I misspelled 'genius' when several of my friends and colleagues jumped on the chance to point out the irony of my illiteracy. 

5.

Unknowingly opened a dick pic sent to me from my father who thought he was sending that shit to my mom. 

6.

Speaking of dick, somehow drunk me managed to get his poor balls stuck on his zipper twice in one night (the second time I had to call my best friend for a helping hand: I said no homo, he did not). 

7.

Took a random ride on my younger cousin's BMX bike, sat my ass down mid-ride, and was painfully reminded there was nothing but exposed steel to fucking sit on (tl:dr got butt raped by BMX).

8.

Suffered an asthma attack while masturbating in the shower and almost blacked out while waiting for my dick to defuse before I had the courage to call my roommate for my inhaler. 

9.

Visited my sister in law who told me not to freak out if her pet bird decides to fly over to sit on my shoulder. The bitch fucking flew like 10 seconds later and I freaked the fuck out. I dodged the damn bird on instinct and inadvertently caused it to fly face first into the window behind me. It survived, but my sister in law made damn sure I didn't.

AITA not caring about or accommodating for my roommate's girlfriend's baby,"I (27F) and my roommate (23M) rent from our landlord (60M) and are both on the lease. Recently my roommate started dating a woman (19F) with a kid (toddler). 

Both the woman and the kid are really annoying. I'm childfree and dislike being around children. This annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. I could deal with this until now. Roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). I am very vocally not happy with this and I told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. It's been a month so I'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.

Best thing I can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. I don't acknowledge the kid, I bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, I moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since I hate going out there now anyway. Apart from that business is completely normal. I smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as I do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who I have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as I want during non-quiet hours. I refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. One time I was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating. I saw a bunch of texts from roommate saying that they need me to babysit. I lied and said I was out which lead to them having to cancel their plans for the day.

Roommate's girlfriend HATES me and thinks I'm being selfish. Thinks that the baby needs to come first. She has no money and my roommate makes a lot less than me so she thinks I should be responsible for childproofing the house. I told her to take it up with the landlord and that I wasn't wasting my money on her and her kid that isn't even wanted here.

Today I was having my lunch with my mom and vented about this to her and she said that I'm being really mean because even though the circumstances aren't ideal ""babys should come first, always"". Am I really the asshole for wanting to live my life exactly the same as before some unwanted kid started squatting in my house?

The venue/bar I was attending is actually on the city line between East Lansing and Lansing, so the officer directed me to the Lansing PD. 

The LPD officer told me that bar always calls about fake ID's and-- in his words-- ""90% of the time, they're wrong"" so he told me not to worry and he would get my identification back for me.

TIFU by unzipping my balls,"Not sure if this disqualified me but it actually happened a few minutes ago. Just before my shower I decided to do a bit of manscaping on the ol' vagina miner. Grabbed the dedicated clippers and went to town knocking back some of that Kentucky fescue when I spotted one slightly angry looking follicle. Positionally, we're talking less on Alvin and moreso on the chipmunks. As any sane person would do, I grabbed some tweezers with the intention of yanking the little shit out (the hair not the dick). I squeezed the hair with my tweezers, and being the baby I am, gave it a fast tug. And because the universe is a cold-hearted bitch, it turned out that this hair wasn't your standard ingrown. Nah. This greedy fiber decided it wasn't enough to coil up in a small ball and just uncoil like your grandmother's knitting yarn. Instead, it chose to grow at a near 90¬∞ to my taco bender so when I gave it that sweet tug of justice it split open my hog like FedEx shipping envelope. And so here I stand with one hand clutching toilet paper against my angry inch while the other types this out to you fine dimes. Hope you have a great Saturday and can manage to keep your favorite penis in better shape than I have.

Officially as of today Jane has vacated my apartment, and building management has changed the locks. We were able to come to a signed agreement where she agreed to vacate the property within 7 days if i refunded her last two months of rent. (\~4200$). Which i did. Honestly between this and my other legal fees i am basically in the hole, and i would have been better off not having anyone rent my apartment. 

I talked to someone who is doing a story on Jane, and they were able to confirm that she apparently works for a company rents out places on AirBNB (said person who was doing a story basically told me they weren't going to pursue this anymore due to time concerns). She isn't a grad student nor is she even a student. 

I don't feel like i won, and honestly i just feel absolutely infuriated with the entire situation. AirBNB to this day still has my place being listed on AirBNB. Who knows why she doesn't have keys anymore. 

My apartment is a disaster right now and from what my property manager has stated it seems like people definitely did smoke in my apartment. There are burns on my couch from cigarette, my dishwasher is broken, and pretty much everything needs a desperate deep clean. But my apartment is safe more or less. 

Anyways i wanted to thank everyone for your advice. It probably isn't the best ending but it taught me an extremely valuable lesson, and i can go home at Christmas and hopefully clean my apartment. ",legaladvice

TIFU by treating my Horse like a Dog,"Technically, my fuck up was last night. Let me start by saying, I rent a beautiful home in the country on 200 acres of land. I have a horse, dog, and 3 cats. My horse lives in a field in my backyard. 6 acres of beautiful grass, hills, a stream, and a huge 20x10ft stall, all properly fenced.

Last week, my horse bruised his foot and was limping. I decided to put up a temporary fence in my yard and keep my lame horse in my backyard where the ground is soft and the grass is greener. He could barely walk so there was really no concern over him escaping. He was beyond over joyed.

Yesterday, I had the ferrier come and fix his shoes as he was no longer limping. Here's where the fuck up  begins. I loved having my horse in the backyard. It was like having a giant dog hanging out with me. So I figured, what's the harm in one more night?

6 am, my phone is ringing. It's my landlord. There are 12 state trooper at my house trying to wrangle my horse who is leisurely strolling down the main road. He was fine, they had fun, my horse made friends with a super sweet lady trooper who was giggling the whole time she was walking him back home while he was nuzzling her face.

Not nearly the worst of fuck ups but I thought everyone might enjoy something that doesn't involve sex.

TLDR: Treated my horse like a dog for a week while he was injured, only to have him escape when he felt better, causing a closed road and a bunch of state troopers a fun morning playing cowboy.

TIFU by forgetting I pranked my friend and accidentally giving him mild depression,"Mandatory this didn't happen today, but rather a few years ago...

Back when I was at Uni my best friend (James) and I used to always try prank each other creatively by getting on each other's Facebooks/social media. Think things like messaging our friends with odd messages trying to sell them a ridiculous pyramid scheme , changing each other's profile picture, etc... you get the idea.

One day near the end of my final year, we are in his room about to go for a night out and James goes to the bathroom, leaving his laptop unlocked (with facebook logged in). I take this as my opportunity to execute my latest master plan - I was going to change his post settings on facebook to ""only me"" (i.e. his posts would be invisible to anyone else) and post something outrageous and completely inappropriate (knowing he has his family on facebook). Plan was that he would come in, see the post and freak out / get super pissed, for me to reveal the gaff to him and have a laugh.

However, I only managed to execute the first part of my plan (i.e. changing the setting to ""only me"") before he came back into the room, and I had to quickly exit facebook to avoid being found out.

Now, the fuck up was that we went out, got quite drunk, came back home, and I COMPLETELY forgot about this prank. Fast forward to almost a year later...

My friend is still at Uni (doing a masters degree) while I have moved to another city and started working. I should add that James is a big time electric guitar player, and in the last year got into recording videos of himself and posting them on youtube / social media. He messages me one day asking what I thought of his latest video on facebook. I went to his page and noticed there was no post... in fact, there were no posts for around a year...

I call him and tell him there's no post, to which he says that can't be, I posted it yesterday and am looking at the post now. I'm on the phone with him when it suddenly just \*clicks\* and I am immediately MORTIFIED - This entire time, I had left the ""only me"" setting on, and he hadn't realised. I hang up to compose myself before calling him back and telling him the truth.

For the last year or so, he had been posting several videos and had received 0 likes or comments. He had taken most of his previous videos down, had wondered why nobody liked his videos, if people just hated him since most of his friends graduated, if he was really crap at guitar... One thing he told me in particular was particularly heart-breaking - ""I often layed awake at night thinking about this"". I don't want to use the term depression too loosely, but it really affected him and he considered going for counselling.

Luckily he was good about it and didn't hold a grudge, and we now laugh about it. Bought him a lot of drinks next time I saw him though.

TL;DR  Forgot I changed my friend's facebook settings so that nobody else could see his posts, he thought nobody liked him and was mildly depressed for a year.

Edit: Grammar

Edit 2: I should add that I was of course extremely apologetic and remorseful after this happened, and still feel terrible when I think about it. He understandably was pissed at first, but realised it was completely accidental and was just a colossal fuck up. The ""reveal"" itself was over 6 months ago, I was reminded earlier today when I saw an obvious ""stupid facebook prank"". We still talk amost daily, and he is staying with me until he finds a flat once he also moves to the same city as me for work in a couple weeks (will make sure to keep my laptop locked though...)

Edit 3: Just to clarify, he wasn't just starting to play guitar. He has played since he was a kid and is genuinely a great guitar player. During his masters, he started filming cover videos/recordings as a hobby. His videos now get several likes and complimentary comments

Edit 4: So a lot of people have been asking for posting a link to his videos. After watching this blow up, I called my friend and linked him the reddit. He is amazed and wants everyone to know he's fine. He isn't keen on me sharing his actual profile for privacy reasons, but said I could post some (starting with one) of his videos on a separate youtube account and linking it to this post. Here is the cover he wanted to share with me that exposed the fuck up: [https://youtu.be/eH\_m88IUoVk](https://youtu.be/eH_m88IUoVk).

I was drunk and pretended to be asleep so I wouldn't have to talk to my boyfriend but It turned dark.,"I (21f) was on a work night out two nights ago and drank a bit but wasn't too drunk just tipsy. My boyfriend also went out for drinks and met me afterwards and we went home together.
He was acting rude towards me and was pissed off that I walked out of the nightclub with a male colleague that he knows I'm friends with.

Fast forward to when we're in bed, turned off the lights and start to cuddle. He asks if I'm alright and I didn't answer I wasn't in the mood to talk and he just presumed I was asleep.

This is where it turns weird on both our parts, I'm slightly embarrassed to say I let it go this far but at the same time I wanted to see what he was going to do I DID NOT let it go on because I liked what was happening because I genuinely felt sick. 

He put his hand down my pants and started rubbing and when I didn't react he spit on his fingers and put them in me. He then went to the other hole which is something I would never let him do and something we have never done before. I held back every urge to stop him because I needed to see what he was capable of.

He started to wank off and then started going under the covers with the torch on his phone. This is where I couldn't let it go on any further and I started to 'wake up' I asked what was he doing and he said nothing and asked was I okay and started to tickle my back till I 'fell asleep' again.

He tried the flash light thing 2 more times and then ran into the bathroom. After he was in the bathroom awhile I asked was he okay and he said he was taking a shit. 

Now I've asked him to move out and he's making it difficult saying he'll convince me to stay with him. He doesn't know I know what he did, as far as he's aware I was blackout drunk.

EDIT/UPDATE: I packed up his stuff and had it ready when he finished work. My mom was home too so at least I had someone nearby.

He sat down and told me he thinks I'm making a rash decision since he thinks this is all over choking and a bite mark he left on me. He went on and on about how he won't do it again and said he'll get help and he wants this to work.

I caught him off guard and asked what was he doing with a flashlight under the covers and his whole face went white he was shaking and blamed it on his heart beating. He said he fingered me for 10 seconds because I was talking back to him which made him think I was awake which I know wasn't true and that he went down with a flashlight because he thought I was bleeding and had to check it wasn't on the sheets.

He ended up saying he felt sick and I said it's because he's caught out and feels guilt. I also told him I might go to the police over the bite. He played victim and stuck to his story even tho I know what really happened.",relationship_advice
"If you cut off Mike Wazowski's legs, does that count as decapitating him?","me and my friends can't come to an agreement on this topic

opinion 1: yes it counts, the entire round part is the head, and the whole face must be cut off for it to count, pretty simple

opinion 2: no it doesn't, he still has arms, one would assume he has a stomach and stuff in the bottom half of the round part which wouldn't be considered the head, decapitation would be cutting him across just above the arms, this would mean that Mikes eye is on his head, while his mouth is more on his torso, in addition, most creatures in the movie(s) come from a source of realism (eg. randall being a generic lizard, the mean lady being a slug, and the boss guy being a spider, and sully being some kind of bear or something if you count that) so it's fair to assume there's some kind of realism as to where Mike's stomach, kidneys, bladder, etc goes

"Friends reported me as a suicide risk as a prank, I was taken to a psych ward for the whole weekend. Need advice on legal consequences of their actions.","A few of my friends (not anymore) thought it would be funny to report me to the police as a suicide risk. I was out with them on Friday night and we had a few drinks. After I left for home, apparently they decided to call the police in turns (maybe 6 or 7 calls) each telling them that I was very suicidal that night and I had repeatedly told them that I was considering suicide and that I also own a gun. They lied about me being cheated on by a girlfriend earlier this week. I don't have a girlfriend.

Anyway, that night police showed up and I was drunk. Obviously at the time I didn't know what was going on. The police asked me several questions and I answered them, but I was also very sleepy. Police told me that I need to be checked by a medical professional and they're waiting for the ambulance to arrive. I was checked by the EMS and asked to go to a hospital with them for further tests to ensure that I was fine. At the hospital they wanted to perform blood and urine tests which I refused to consent to. I was told that I'm not allowed to leave until I am assessed by a social worker in the morning. This left me so frustrated and in the morning I was a little agitated by all of these when I did speak with the social worker, who then recommended that I'll be taken psych ward for further examination and ensuring that I was not a danger to myself and others. Up until this point I had no idea that my friends had reported me for this. The social worker said this decision is made based on the testimony of multiple people who know me personally who were concerned for my well-being and they can't take these signs lightly.

To make it short, things were cleared up at the psych ward (although very slowly) and I was let go on Monday morning in time to make it to work without being significantly late.

My friends (not anymore) had bragged on Facebook about how they've made me committed and were praising their skills of deception and pranking. Luckily, another friend noticed these and took screenshots.

Assuming I go to the police with these, are they facing any legal consequences?

My wife and I have been together for 10 years. Married for 5. We met in college and has been the love of my life since.

2 days ago she told me she doesnt love me anymore and for her happiness wants our relationship to end.

I probably should have seen this coming, our relationship has been rocky since we met but for whatever reason I always wanted to make it work. 

We have 3 kids together, all under the age of 6. They are amazing and so happy and the best thing from our marriage.

Financially, my wife is a stay at home mom. She owns our house outright from family money. She has no student loans but also no college degree. I make a fairly decent income and support our family. 

Since my wife doesnt have a job and no way to pay bills, she wants me to move into her finished basement and continue to pay utilities and food for us and our kids, in addition to keeping her on my health insurance. She wants to take time to get her degree and file for dissolution afterwards, so she can support herself and our kids.

She also wants this for continuity for our kids. While she doesnt love me anymore, she doesnt want me out of our kids lives even weekly, and still wants to be friends with me.

I'm honestly dying inside right now, because as rocky as our relationship has been I've never loved her less, and she has been all I've ever loved or wanted.

I dont know how to proceed or even feel at this point. Im terrified because I've let my friendships go since we've been married and while my family will support me i dont have many friends left. I'm terrified about finances. I'm terrified of not being able to be happy without her. Honestly i'm so confused about everything going on in my head.

TX - Update. I informed the father of his possible two kids who are married to each other.,"Met up with him after work and got right down to it. I informed him that his son in law had asked me to find his dad and that I have a very good idea of who it was. 

He did not take the news well when I told him his son in law was probably his son. Lots of screaming. Lots of blaming me. Eventually lots of apologizing to me. I told him I would like to approach this differently as there is the chance he is not the father. I told him to get a dna test done and that I would inform his son in law that his supposed father refuses to meet without a DNA test being done first to prove it. He agreed this was a good idea. His thoughts were on his grandkids asking if it would be a good idea to have them tested for any genetic abnormalities. I told him to hold off until this can be done first. 

I told his son in law the news this morning that his possible dad refuses to meet until he gets a DNA test proving parentage. 

He agreed without any hesitation. 

So now its a waiting game. The lab I use for this takes 2-3 weeks but is very thorough with their work. The dad is scheduled for a swab tomorrow morning and the son in law is scheduled the next day. I did this on purpose to avoid any chance happenings.

[UPDATE] My room mate is accusing me of grand larceny. I've been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street. NYC.,"First and foremost, I just want to say thank you for the support and the advice given to me. I did not expect such a huge amount of outreach. 

When I posted yesterday, it was just a jumble of words that I put together without putting in much thought because well I just got a phone call telling me all my things were being thrown out the window and I pretty much panicked.  

For some context, I've been living in the same apartment complex for about four years. I'm very well acquainted with the neighbors, security, superintendent and so on. So while I was away on vacation, when the accusation happened my room mate went around the complex to anyone who would listen that I stole $3700, I'm wanted for arrest and there's a restraining order refraining me from even coming onto the premises. This is how I was able to get the information through word of mouth. 

So from all the advice that I was given.. I decided to check on this RO and couldn't find it at all in the system. Turns out my room mate merely just filed a police report and none of the things I was hearing was true. 

So I got to my apartment complex and a lot of my things were in garbage bags and was thrown out of the window. My things were everywhere. So I called the police. I let them know the situation and they came into the apartment with me along with my landlord.

My room was indeed broken into and trashed. Many of my valuables such as my laptop, some sentimental jewelry that was given to me, shoes, etc were all missing. I was devastated. I filed a police report with the officers and stated everything that was missing and took a lot of pictures and videos like many of you stated.

During all this my room mate was there and it also looked as if other people started living there too. Turns out my room mate is using this situation to now squat on the property, not pay rent and also brought other people and friends to live there as well? Unfortunately because of this, there was no arrests even though all my valuables were missing and half my things were scattered across the street. The police said that because there is so many people coming in and out of my apartment and no witnesses they were not able to arrest anyone. I was advised that this was a matter of civil (I think) court and I would have to settle this there. They also advised me that I could stay here BUT they believe that it wasn't in my best interest or my safety to stay since he seemed violent and will be squatting on the property anyway which can take months to evict. So they escorted me into my room to collect whatever else I had left and I am now still staying with my friend. 

As for my lease, my landlord is understanding and feels sorry for everything's that happened. We're mutually agreeing to end the lease without any problems. 

I don't really have a place to call home now and I pretty much have to start over since I was only able to grab clothes. Even if I did end up grabbing all my things, I wouldn't have anywhere to put it. In hindsight, I feel foolish for being tricked. I guess this is a do over but thanks to all of you, at least I know the next steps to take and have some understanding of what to do and I find comfort in that. Again, thank you.",legaladvice

"I don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.","Using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't I? If I contended this in public, I'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. But from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. Here's why.

&#x200B;

**1,153.** That's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per [The Washington Post.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) This averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. Below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - Terrorism.** Let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. Notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on United States soil in 2016. This is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. [Source](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - Falling.** Whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 US lives in 2011. The amount of fucks I give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around Mercury. So why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   [Source](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - Diabetes.** If you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. Yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. [Source](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200B;

And, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **Airplane/Spacecraft Crash** \- 26 deaths
* **Drowning in the Bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **Getting Struck by a Projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **Pedestrian Getting Nailed by a Lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **Accidentally Strangling Yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200B;

Now, here's a [New York Times Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*New Reality for High School Students: Calculating the Risk of Getting Shot.*"" Complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. Why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? What it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the [Washington Post:](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>That means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed¬†by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly¬†1 in 614,000,000**. And since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. The chance of a child¬†being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200B;

In percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. It's a number so remarkably small that every calculator I tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. Thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. There is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",unpopularopinion
Does anyone else stay up at night because they feel if they go to sleep then they havent gotten enough free time at home?,"I'm a high school student, just a freshman, and sometimes I feel that if I go to sleep early then I'll just be like ""Well, this day just felt like school, barely any time at home.""

My (21M) girlfriend (21F) went on an anti Semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. I'm Jewish...,"Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/beskkf/update_my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

We've been together for 3 months and I had no idea that she held those beliefs. She's always been a calm, ""make love not war"" kinda person and very kind to everyone. This is completely out of character and I'm still not sure if she was trolling or not. 

Yesterday evening we were sitting in the car and she was talking to some guy from her internship. She sounded heated and they were clearly arguing over something. When she hung up she said that he was an asshole, a douchebag etc...then she started calling him a ""dirty ass Jew"". I was shocked to say the least and didn't even know what to say, it came out of nowhere. She said that all Jews are ""extremely arrogant"" and that they disgust her. 

For the record, we never discussed our religious backgrounds. Neither of us are religious (she's Middle Eastern) so that's just not something we ever brought up. 


She continued saying that you can't trust Jews, that they're all ""rats"" and that she'd rather die than associate with someone ""so corrupt"". I asked her if that's how she really feels and she said yes of course.


I still haven't told her that I'm Jewish, I'm not even sure how she will react when I do tell her. Should I even bother? It sucks because she's an amazing girl and I'm ridiculously attracted to her but had no clue she was like this. Any advice?

TIFU by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door,"Throwaway account because obviously.

My boyfriend and I are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. We got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. We're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. I started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so I figured on going to completion. Unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

So there I am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. His mom comes in! I freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. Meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. Eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

Anyways, it's 5:40am, I've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

TL;DR: Bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

Update @7:31am - Thanks for all the reassuring comments. My bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. Anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. More to come.

Update @8:38am - Of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... Anyways thanks! So breakfast started off totally fine. I mean, yeah I was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. That is, until I excused myself to go shower. She stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. But then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". It was sweet and cringy all at once. I guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

Anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

Update: A lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. Actually I assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); I didn't actually see her do it. I asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while I was...ehm...cleaning.",tifu
"WIBTA if I quit my job, sell my share in company and retire to be a ski patroler? I would essentially leave my adult kids (18 and 22) to fend for themselves with no way to pay for college. Ex wife as well.","So years and years of backstory here. Ex wife has BPD and life with her has been a continuous struggle. We are in the middle of a divorce because while she's lied, stolen, abused, hit, etc... she never cheated. But she crossed that line and enough was enough. Divorce is bitter and ugly. 

For financial reasons we had set kids college savings up with my wife as custodian. I implored kids to go to the brokerage companies to remove wife as a custodian now they were adults. The both blew me off and ""yeah yeahed"" me for almost a year. Ex cleaned out every penny of the accounts, probably to buy her new house. Instead of my kids even asking thier mom why, let alone taking legal action they both held their hands out to me and expected me to make up for it. Then getting mad at me when I said I had far too much on my plate to add another battle with thier mom, they had to handle it. Since there was no way to pay for school this semester, both have essentially become shut ins at home. 

I've had it because niether shows an iota of interest in thier future. On a lark I called my college roommate who is head ski patrol at a small resort in NM. He said I'm hired. I talked to my partner and he'd gladly buy my half of the business. With the 50% id have to give my ex wife I could live modest and comfortably for the rest of my life. I could spend my summers hiking, my winters working and maybe just not spend 15 hours a day at a desk working for 3 people who just see me as a wallet.

Kids would be cut off. I wouldn't be able to afford ANY help. They have avenues and legal recourse with thier mom, whether they take it is up to them. But they'd have to grow up and fast.

"AITA for giving my concert ticket to another girl after my friend said she only wanted to go with me as ""friends""?","I am 24M and I have a friend who is 21, she is really nice and we've known each other for a year. She is my sister's acquaintance and we met at my sister's birthday party. I have a crush on her although she isn't exactly my type. Lately I feel like I've been getting vibes that she likes me back.

Last week I won a raffle and have 2 tickets to see a famous singer perform next month in a nearby city. She also happens to like this singer so I asked her if she wanted to go with me as a date. I said I can book us a hotel room and we can spend the night together. She said she'd love to go, but only as friends. She says she's alright with us splitting a hotel room as long as it has two beds. She told me she doesn't feel ready to date anyone at the moment, and she doesn't do flings either, so unfortunately we can only be platonic friends. I said I'll think about it. I was quite hurt because honestly I don't have much experience with rejection, and I was annoyed that she turned me down. 

Today, i asked my female coworker to go with me to the concert as a date. She immediately said yes and seemed quite excited about it although she admitted that she never listened to any of their songs. Still, I'm taking her out for drinks on Friday. But just now, the friend who I asked originally asked if we were still on for the concert. I told her honestly that I already asked another woman, and she seemed disappointed but dropped the subject.

When I told my sister about what happened, she said I'm being really douchy. She says her friend is a huge fan of the singer and I should take her instead of my coworker who doesn't even like the band but only wants to go because she likes me. I said she can't understand because she's not a dude. Because let's me honest, if I had the choice between going out with a girl who only wants to be my ""friend"" versus a girl who is super into me and wants to take things to the next level, then obviously I'm taking the second one. AITA for just being honest about what I want?

**EDIT**: Because a lot of the hang up is over the hotel room thing: YES I would have been fine if the first girl agreed to go with me as a date, but wanted separate hotel beds/rooms. Nowhere do I even say that we have to share a bed...

But the part where she says she's not ready to date anyone essentially means she is not interested in me. She likely said she'll go with me as friends just to be nice and not hurt my feelings. So why would I make the experience awkward for the both of us when I could bring along someone who actually is interested in dating me? **EDIT OVER**",AmItheAsshole

AITA? Told GF to move out and life has gotten 10X harder for her.,"Hi

I'll keep this simple, and avoid going over the top.

In a nutshell my GF (33) and her little girl (7) moved into my (35/M) house last year.  The house is owned and I bought it because I have two children (8 YO twins - M and F) from a previous relationship.

When she moved her and her girl in I made it clear she was welcome to stay as long as she treated my house as she would her own.

Yet when she moved in her amd her daughter did the following over the last year or so.

- Left mountains of food everywhere.  - Left pans of food on the kitchen counter until it went green with mold.
- Got muck/handprints everywhere
- Broke and refused to replace things in my house
- Would leave the radiators, lights, gas on all day
- Refused to tidy up saying she was tired
- Left mountains of clothes everywhere
- Used the floor as a rubbish bin (ended up with mice)
- Constant drama, shouting, arguing - Witnessed by neighbours
- Literally drained me emotionally and financially
- Both of them gave me attitude non-stop, for no particular reason other than to stave the boredom.
- Put holes for shelves etc in all my walls
- Would spend money on fun things for her and her daughter, yet left me to pay the grown up things like bills, debt etc
- Kept leaving the toilet a mess
- Treat my own 2 children like dirt when they came over, ie shouting, drama, constantly blaming them for everything etc

When I questioned her on any of these matters she would say I was being controlling.

About a month ago, a serious argument erupted and I told her it's best she leave.  I said 'if you want to live like that, then go and get your own place'.  It was a shame for me to see my hard earned investment become ruined by someone with no respect for it.

We are still seeing each other, but now she has gotten her own place I feel terrible.  She's having to walk everywhere as she dosent drive, and her working hours have altered as previously I was taking her little girl to school to make life easier for her.  Also, she was only paying me ¬£165 per month for everything, but now her bills will be in excess of ¬£600 per month for her rent alone.

I feel dreadful for this, I feel like maybe I should have had more patience towards them or been a better guy when they were here.

AITA?  Or would anyone else have reacted in the same way?


Edit: Just to follow up - She doesn't drive and I also feel bad that now she has to walk/get the bis everywhere as before I was acting like her own private taxi service.  Ie, taking her shopping, giving her daughter lifts to school and to dance classes etc.

UPDATE:  Wow, didn't expect such a response from this!

After getting many responses, roughly 90% of which say I'm NTA and the rest saying I am for staying with her I've decided to break this off.
Like some of you've mentioned, I owe this to my children and myself to give them what they need.  A good, solid, strong dad who is happy and secure.  As of this point, she is no longer in my life.

A while ago I asked my 8yo daughter if she thinks about me when she's not at my house, her answer was:

 ""Yes I think of you getting shouted at by XXXX""

Some of you have said I'm a shit dad for staying with her after all of this.  I would argue against this, but if I stay with her I would have to agree with you all.

UPDATE:  I wasnt going to post this, but as many of you are asking about it as you consider it a factor, I'll respond.

A)  No the sex was mediocre at best, once a week if I was lucky.

B)  She never gave BJs

"Michigan; I have dash cam footage of my dealer abusing my car (racing it), they want to meet this week to discuss it.","I have already made one post about this asking about if I should share my dash cam footage with the dealer in question, or if legally I was better of not doing so.

It seemed like there was no harm sharing the evidence, as long as it was unmodified (it was not modified).

The manger of the dealership has finished reviewing the footage and called me yesterday to set up a meeting to discuss the abuse to my car. 

To summarize everything that occurred;

1) CPO Vehicle was damaged upon pickup, I foolishly agreed to let the dealer fix it rather than taking my Credit Union's check and leaving

2) Repair work was less than average in quality, clear coat runs, body panel still was damaged (it was a fender and it was still bent on the inside). Found the passenger fog light is also damaged after the repair, dealer claims I bought the car like that, its a CPO and it should have been inspected (as per Manufactorer's inspection sheet). 

3) dealer agrees to fix it again, I drop the car off during my 2 week long vacation. Car sits at the lot, gets joy ridden back and fourth between the body shop (~75 miles round trip), Body shop wet sands clear coat, doesn't address additional damage, says ""we stand by our work.""

4) Found footage, emailed dealership with clip of footage explaining I am upset and want compensation for the wear to my vehicle, unhappy with the body repairs that are still not done properly.

5) ~1month to get a response, had to reach out to Corporate customer relations to get the dealer to respond after multiple phone calls/voice mails and no returned calls.

6) Dealership manager reaches out, wants video footage of incidents, I dropped footage off 

7) setup meeting with manager this coming week to follow up and discuss.

The car was ran to redline multiple times, the driver seemed to not be very good at driving stick, so he/she frequently was riding the clutch during these jaunts to high RPM, he clutch dumped it once causing wheel hop/spinning tires. My trips to the dealer have added about 500 miles overall to the car just trying to get the body work addressed and now the excess wear to the vehicle from being driven hard, this has been going on since the end of March. 

I am not sure what kind of compensation I should see to be acceptable (legally speaking). Initially I asked to have the dealer buy the car back from me so I could walk away from all of this, but I don't anticipate this to be given as an option.

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men","It's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

Cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. Who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. Most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. But every woman I have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. And a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

And if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. If men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. But most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. Its ludicrous.

TL;DR: Women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. This is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. Sorry this was so long.

Edit: Okay obviously I didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so I would like to clarify some things. 

1. This thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. I have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. People who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. I am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. But there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. People refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. Those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, I think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have A LOT to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society.

She just says ""I'm just being honest"" a lot. The problem is that she can't take a joke herself.  Even polite criticism pisses her off A LOT and makes shit super awkward.  My friends and I have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it's about her.  

Today at lunch though I had enough.  She was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  ""Are you sure you're not trans?  I've never heard of a guy being anorexic.""  And then, ""It's not attractive. Just being honest.""   So I said, ""You're not just being honest, you're being a bitch.""  She asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  And I was like, ""No one thinks you're funny.  The only thing that's funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  Take a look at yourself.""  

No one else was saying anything. She got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  I was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me I went too far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  ",AmItheAsshole

(Update) I (35M) caught my wife (29F) rehearsing a speech for my funeral (?),"OP: [ttps://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/9ik5nt/i\_35m\_caught\_my\_wife\_29f\_rehearsing\_a\_speech\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9ik5nt/i_35m_caught_my_wife_29f_rehearsing_a_speech_for/)

Tl;Dr overheard my wife talking about me as if I was dead, she said she was reading a book out loud

There were 2 edits to this OP

1 - To clarify I don't believe this woman is capable of murder one

2 -  I looked through her browser history (not snooping, but details won't matter) and she is shopping for wedding dresses?

&#x200B;

Update:

Met a buddy for lunch and told him the whole tale. He too found it morbid af, but did't see her committing first degree murder. Asked me if I thought she could be having an affair (he has a history with weird stuff turning out to be cheater SO). Suggested I get a PI in case of cheating, and call my lawyer in case of murder.

I said I'll consider it. But I know my wife, she is usually pretty shy. I'm still REALLY thinking this might be something silly that got her embarrassed. Was it any other topic, I'd have asked right away. The funeral thing just got me creeped out and I probably would leave it alone if not for my growing curiosity.

Buddy makes a point that there is no harm in calling my lawyer just to check on the procedure to change beneficiaries on life insurance and such, so I'm prepared in the event things go even more weird. I agree, no harm in that. Call the lawyer, tell him I'm discussing finances with the wife and we are thinking about changing both our beneficiaries (trying not to make it look like I suspect her, you know), he says he's stepping into a restaurant with a client can he call me back.

I move on with my work, have a long day, so, honestly, I forget about it.

When I get home late at night, my wife is *upset*. And that is an understatement.

I am quickly educated on two things that happened on her day:

1 - Lawyer called. He wasn't able to get a hold of me anywhere else. Was wondering what were the questions we had about changing the beneficiaries on life insurances. Wife had no idea what he was talking about. He seemed uncomfortable upon hanging up.

2 - Turns out my buddy talked to his wife (in confidence) and told her everything. His wife told a couple of close friends (in confidence) as well. And on it went until the gossip reached a friend of my wife's who actually knew what was happening. She called my wife and told her she should talk to me asap.

She is mortified. Upset, hurt, confused, embarrassed. The whole deal. A little mad as well. Maybe more than a little.

She tells me she joined a community theater, drama club, something, and will be playing a widow. The monologue is an acting exercise to tap into emotions. (Which btw is something many of you told me was a possibility, so thank you, you were right). Her friend (the one who knew what was going on) was the one who convinced her it would be a good idea, to help her out with her shy personality.

She lied about it being a book because she too thinks it is a creepy thing to do, and didn't feel like sharing at the time, since the whole drama club is something she was doing for herself. But she thought I only heard her speaking, as in ""her voice"", not ""what she was saying"". Had she known what I heard, she would have explained it.

I ask her why didn't she tell me about the drama club. She looks at me like I have no business asking her another question for as long as we both shall live, not even about the weather. But she says it is ""her thing"" and she even made her friend promise not to mention it because she didn't want all of us at one of the plays (we are a tight bunch) until she was more comfortable on stage.

I say she could have just told me, to which she replies with something like ""are you telling me that you can keep something private that happens in our household to yourself without bringing all our friends into it?""

After the latest events I don't have an answer for her.

But I'm still missing a piece of the puzzle. So I ask ""what about the wedding dress?"".

This is when I realize this part of the story didn't reach her yet. She asks me ""what"" and I have the pleasure of telling my wife I went through her personal computer.

**Now** she is homicidal.

Grabs me by my shirt, drags me up to our closet and shows me ""the wedding dress"" (in the making) for the play. It is amateur theater, so they have more than one job and she is also helping with the costumes, wardrobe, whatever it is called. She was looking online for cheap dresses or for styling ideas to make her own (she is quite skilled in making clothes and such, and the search history did say ""old"" or ""vintage"" wedding dress). She also shows me nun's clothes and a pirate's in her closet and asks me if that means she is attacking the British. By now I am just wondering what the fuck is this play about? A bride, a pirate and a nun? Who the fuck is writing this shit? But I'm guessing I shouldn't be talking anymore.

She is pissed that I would think she is capable of murder enough to call our lawyer, that I told all our friends about her embarrassing monologue and went through her personal computer. Not to mention ruining the drama club she was enjoying.

I just nod, apologize profusely, try to explain that things didn't happen quite like that, and show myself to the guest bedroom because we both know where this is going.

She then tells me I can't even sleep there. Since my brother and his wife will be staying with us for a few days, she already changed the sheets and had everything cleaned and ready and says ""you will just make a mess""

So last night I had the privilege of sleeping on the couch.

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr Wife was practicing my eulogy, turns out it was a play. I got to sleep on the couch and am currently hoping she wont file for divorce.

&#x200B;

Edit just to be safe: I realize I took some liberties with my writing.

Just to make it clear: I think she was more upset with the version of the story that reached her than the actual facts. It will take her a moment to process the stuff (what actually happened) I told her. Also, she didn't use any literal physical violence against me. That was just bad writing on my part.

You all be good, you wonderful people

&#x200B;

Edit 2:

People calling it bullshit made me smile. People saying the fact I didn't answer to those calls proves that it is bullshit made me smile some more.

I mean no disrespect, but I have a job, guys.

Look, I had a weird problem and I want to say ""thank you"" to everyone who took a few moments of their days to help a stranger. I was creeped out and you all truly helped, so thank you!

To the ones asking for more details... I mean, I could say my wife is a Pilates instructor who has most of her day to herself, that our study is a mess of fabric and half made clothes so she could be working on costumes for the whole Cirque du Soleil and I would still be oblivious, I could answer every single question you all have until my fingers went raw, but let's face it: it would be pointless. And I would have to share more personal details than I am comfortable with. I even mentioned on comments I kept some details (and people) out of the story for this very reason.

So thank you to the ones who believed me enough to help, I read all the comments, though I couldn't answer them all. This update was for you, since I received more help than I thought I would, when I first posted. You guys were amazing.

Thank you to the ones who called it bullshit as well, you guys keep this sub in check. It's part of the ride.

And if you are neutral, but my story amused you. Thank you for stopping by and you are welcome.

To the ones suggesting I should post on TIFU, I might later if I get some time.

I haven't read all the comments yet, not even close, but I will do my best to!

AITA for being mad my girlfriend took my keys?,"My lovely girlfriend and I have been together for 8 months. She slept over at my place last night, and in the morning she woke me up saying she had went out and brought back a couple of lattes and pastries from a coffee shop around the corner from my apartment for breakfast.

My issue with this is that my apartment has a two factor entry, first my student ID to scan in and then my key to get back into the apartment (it auto locks).

I asked her how she was able to get back into the apartment and she said that she grabbed my keychain (which has my ID on it in a wallet type thing) before heading out to buy us breakfast so she would be able to get back in. I told her that I didn't appreciate her violating my privacy like that, and she got upset, saying that she was just trying to do something nice for me. We started to fight about it and I ended up asking her to leave.

Since then, she hasn't answered any of my texts or calls. When I told my roommate about this he said that I was the asshole because she did something thoughtful for me and I yelled at her about it. I think she was violating my privacy by stealing my keys. AITA?

Edit: I thought it was weird that she took my keys without asking, they could have gotten stolen or something while she was out, I get that she was being nice but why couldn't she have asked??

Edit 2: and no she still hasn't responded to me

Edit: I'm at work now obsessing but I know that I screwed up. I had a bad experience with privacy in my last relationship and i guess I'm projecting or something. And no, my girlfriend hasn't responded to any of my voicemails or texts besides sending back money I tried to send her for the breakfast last night but she might not be awake yet, it's early in my time zone

Final edit because people keep messaging me: long story short, she texted me and we met for coffee earlier this afternoon. I brought her flowers and apologized for being insane. We had a long talk about my privacy issues from my last relationship.  She chose not to break up with me, she will be getting lots of dates and back rubs in the future.

AITA for being too honest about having a baby?,"So as I write this I'm feeding my 7 week old son. I am totally in love with him, he is amazing. However... The process of bringing him into the world was not good. At. All.

In order to explain why i might be an asshole I think its important to explain the circumstances surrounding my sons birth.

I had incredibly bad morning sickness, to the point that I weighed less at the end of my pregnancy than before I conceived (my bmi was 23 pre pregnancy). I could barely walk due to bad hips, my stomach muscles tore apart, and I got a ridiculous number of stretch marks all across my stomach and back.

Then came labour and delivery. I was in labour for 92 hours. My son was back to back, so i was in agony. I had two failed epidurals, ended up on gas and air, paracetamol, and morphine, and still spent hours screaming into the abyss. In the end his heart rate dropped and I had to have him delivered in theatre by ventouse.

I ended up with a second degree vaginal tear, which got infected. My son was ill following delivery and ended up in the NICU for a few days. I had issues breastfeeding once he was out of NICU, and ended up getting mastitis twice within a week, before my milk supply dried out totally. I spent 12 days in hospital total before going home.

Once home my son got ill again and ended up back in hospital on three occasions.

He's finally better and we are finally a normal happy family at home.




So why AITA?

Well, before I got pregnant / gave birth people would tell me how magical pregnancy was and how giving birth wasn't that bad and that you forget the pain as soon as you hold your baby etc. Which, pardon my French, is bollocks. I still remember every moment of pain and currently don't believe I could mentally deal with another pregnancy.

Part of the reason I think I have struggled so much emotionally with all the issues I had was that my experience totally jarred with my expectations. Nobody told me that everything can go wrong. I didn't expect my birth plan to go as I hoped, but i thought I might get some things I wanted. I never expected to have such difficulties feeding my son. I didn't prepare for him being ill. I didn't prepare for feeling totally helpless and useless.

So when my childless friends (who planned on having children in the future) asked me how labour and delivery went, I was totally honest.

I didn't sugar coat anything. I explained everything exactly as it was, and told them of the problems we had as they happened. I have been very honest in saying that whilst my son was worth all the pain, I probably won't be doing it again.

Well my friends have said that I'm an asshole for being so honest as I've put them off having children in the future. I didn't mean to scare them, but I felt that I would have rather had more realistic expectations of what could happen.

I don't feel like I should apologise or say that I exaggerated anything to make them feel better, but maybe I'm wrong.

TIFU by teaching my baby sign language,"I go to this ""mommy and me"" thing every week with my daughter. Not because it's my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as ""a Christmas gift"" to my one-year-old (AKA she doesn't think I am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

Anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the Pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. But all these kids know sign language, and I thought that was pretty damn cool. So I start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! Suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! She can call me mom and my husband, dad! Holy shit! Thanks Pinterest moms! I take back all the shit I talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

Well today with my husband out of town, I didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants I decided to go out for a quick dinner. The kid loves French fries and so do I. So we hit the local burger joint and I order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. The server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and I set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. So of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". And every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. Ok, whatever. 

Well I notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. I'm like okay, I did like 4 quick google searches, maybe I botched some of what I taught her. It's fine. But then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iPhone down with a message typed out for me to read. It says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

I'm like... wait... what? So she continues to show me that I have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since I am her mom. I can only imagine what the Pinterest moms would've done had I shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

TL;DR ASL is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

ETA: Thanks, everyone! I'm glad you all enjoyed this post. Please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that I was trying to teach my child proper ASL. They were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as ASL. They just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

Also please note that I literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. I have no idea how close they were to the real signs. Additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. She speaks English well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. We were always sure to say the words while signing them. She now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that I decided to share with you all.

Before that, the human brain is not yet fully mature, meaning that psychological and behavioural patterns still undergo changes. Thus, our ""true personality"" only manifests itself during the late twenties.

Before that happens, people are often ""in lust"" rather than in love, but without realizing it. Our bodies are wired to produce as much offspring as possible as soon as possible, because early humans used to die young.

"My [16F] Mom [36F] acts ""competitively"" around me since I lost weight.","Hi reddit, 


So this is a weird one probably, I've always been a quite chubby child, but around a year and a half ago I've decided to do something about that and started working out and doing other sports, I'm playing Volleyball and I'm in my high schools cheerleading team. 

Around like 8 months ago my mom has started acting like I'm some sort of ""threat"" to her relationship with my stepdad [41M].

Yes, I've catched my stepdad staring at me few times and I think that's kinda gross but I had hoped she would talk to him about that, but instead she is mad at me.


At first she started teasing me with the fact that I'm lesbian, something she never really had an issue with before, said that I'm still the ""chubby"" girl and other mean things. 

Over time it has only gotten worse to the point where there are some serious restrictions on what I'm allowed to wear. For example, we've a pool, she absolutely doesn't want me to go swimming in it, because she doesn't want me to walk around in a swimsuit or a bikini. 

I'm not allowed to wear my gym clothes or any form of leggings, skirts or dresses or even my cheerleading outfit. 

At multiple occasions she has tried to hide or throw away clothes or make-up. Including Lululemons I've paid for with my own money. 

She always asks me when I'm getting a haircut again and tries to pressure me into my old short hairstyle by saying how unattractive my longer hair looks. (Fun fact: We are both blonde and have similar hair lengths)

AITA for flipping out on my boyfriend for eating my cake?,"My birthday was this past Monday, and my parents got me a cake for it, naturally. I'm originally from Michigan but go to school in Texas, and as a surprise my parents mailed me something called a 'bumpy cake'. They were like my favorite thing when I was little and I'm not sure if they're ONLY available in Michigan but I definitely can't get them in Texas. 

My boyfriend and I each had a slice of the cake, and then put it in the fridge. When I got back from work the next day I was super excited to eat more of it, only to find that not only was pretty much all of it gone, but it was butchered in a way that suggested it had just been eaten out of the box with a fork. 

I went into the bedroom where my boyfriend was and showed him the cake box. He laughed and said something along the lines of ""I couldn't help it!"" I called him a selfish asshole and told him I couldn't believe he felt so entitled to something that didn't belong to him. 

He seemed really shocked and upset and said he didn't think it would be such a big deal. He started apologizing profusely and said he'd get me another cake but I was so upset with him I just left. I came back a little while later and he had gone from sympathetic to angry. He said he couldn't believe I was so mad at him over a ""stupid fucking cake"" and he ended up storming out. 

I realize it seems stupid and I might have overreacted, but I still think it was completely out of line for him to do that. I've told some friends about the situation and they similarly thought I was being ridiculous and that I shouldn't have been so mad over cake. 

Am I the asshole?

UPDATE: I've gotten a few messages asking for an update, so I figured I'd post one here. I haven't been able to read every comment, but I've looked at responses from every viewpoint and have taken everything to heart. A lot of you seem to think I'm just really stingy with my cake, but what I articulated to my boyfriend this morning was that I moreso was extremely upset that he felt entitled to what was essentially my birthday present. 

When he came back he had cooled down a lot, and we talked about everything. He apologized for eating all of the cake, and I apologized for losing my temper about it. When we argue we both have a habit of leaving instead of letting the argument escalate. I'm still not sure if this is the right move or not. 

  

P.S - To all the people messaging me offering to send me a replacement, your generosity is very much appreciated, but a new cake has been ordered!",AmItheAsshole
A man heard that masturbating before sex...,"A man heard that masturbating before sex often helped blokes last longer during the act. The man decided to give it a try. He spent the rest of the  day thinking about where to do it. He couldn't do it in his office, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe. 

On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck.

Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to wank.
He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.

Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, ""What?""

He heard, ""This is the police. What's going on down there?""

The man replied, ""I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted.""

Came the reply, ""Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.""",Jokes
[MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm being accused of cheating in a math exam. I am 16 years old. I got a perfect score in the exam and the teacher asked me to stay after the class and she told me that she knows I cheated. I didn't cheat. My math has always been good except last year when I was dealing with depression. She says she knows someone of my mental faculties will never be able to get a perfect score so I must have cheated.

I told her that I didn't cheat and I'm offended at the accusation. Two days ago I was asked to see the principal who said the same thing, that I should confess to cheating and tell them how I did it so that they can stop other students from doing it. He more or less threatened me ""this can go very well or very bad for you depending on your cooperation with us.""

I told him that I'm happy to retake a new exam right now or at any other time to prove that I didn't cheat but he said that I could have had time to prepare since the time my teacher talked to me. I told him that if their evidence for my cheating is my lack of mental faculties then no amount of studying should make a difference? He still did not agree for me to take another exam to prove that I could get that score.

Yesterday I was asked to his office again and he told me that he knows about how some students are cheating and offered me a clean slate if I let them access my social media and emails to find out who they are and if I give them evidence of other students cheating he will let me retake the exam. I have no knowledge of what he is talking about and I declined access to my social media and email.

I'm now suspended for disobedience of school staff and lack of cooperation for proving my innocence from a cheating charge. This to me sounds very unfair and I can't help but feel like I'm being targeted here for maybe a personal reason? Because this does not make any sense. They have no evidence that I cheated and refused my offer of retaking the exam and they insulted my intelligence.",legaladvice
Someone borrowed my photography gear and suddenly dissappeared and deliberately dropping my calls and won't answer my messages. Now I messaged all of his friends asking for help and the next morning he responded to me and returned my gears. He is now filing a case against me for humiliating him.,"Location - Philippines

Facts:

He usually borrows my photography gear regularly and this is the first time he dissappeared completely. Before he dissappeared he agreed to borrow my gear for a day only.

He has been deliberately avoiding me for about 10 days before I thought of asking help from his friends and families thru social media private message.

I have even filed a report to the local authorities on the 5th day, but this was taking too long and I need my gear for an event! So I decided to asked for help from his contacts.

This was effective as some of his families contacted him when they saw my message to them. The day after that he shows up and returned all of my gear. It turns out that some of them got damaged but he promised to pay for them.

He is now threatening to file a case against me for humiliating him to his contacts. But if I haven't done that, I don't think I can get my gear back!

This was my message to his contacts:

""Hello, if you know Mr xxxx please tell him to return my photography gear as I have been trying to reach him and he is deliberately evading me! He borrowed my gear 10 days ago and he has not returned it. I need the gear badly and this is costing me too much. Appreciate your help if you can help me contact him."" -- Then I attach a photo of his identification card with his photo

Can he really file a case against me?? He won't even answer my question when I asked him why is he evading me.",legaladvice

TIFU by basically buying a serial killer starter kit at my local hardware store...,"This happened earlier today and I'm pretty sure I'm on a police watch list now.

Needed to pick up a few things from my local hardware store I was running low on that I like to have around. Zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. 

While I was there I noticed they were having a store wide sale. I'm an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up I like to keep certain back up items in my truck if I need them. I figured I would grab some things while they are on sale.

Walking through the isles I start randomly grabbing items I think I might need for my kit. Such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.

Keep in mind I already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when I walk up to the register. These are things I generally purchase, buy never all at once.

Girl at the register greets me as I start placing items on the counter. I give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.

About half way through she slows down a bit. She looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. I'm just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.

Then we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:

Her: ""Wow that's a big knife.""
Me: ""Yeah I like having cheap, throwaway knives around. Same with tarps and stuff too.""
Stares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.

Her: ""Can I see your ID to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.""
Me being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as I've never been asked for my ID here. Pull it out and hand it to her. 

She quickly looks at my ID info and then glances up at her screen where I noticed my reward info was pulled up. Didn't think anything of it at the time.

She says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. Almost looking like she was taking inventory of what I had.

She gives me my total and I hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)

I get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. She yells back don't forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. I grab it as I notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.
I say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.

I get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. She glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.

I was like what? Still clueless. Before she points out that it looks like I'm about to go tie someone up and murder them.

Girl at register must have thought the same thing. Checked my info and I'm pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.

Told my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.

TL;DR: 
Bought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. Pretty sure cashier thought I was a serial killer.",tifu
WIBTA if I stopped inviting my triggered friend to movie night?,"Tdlr at the bottom

Every couple of weeks me (f24) and my friends get together for a ""classic movie night"" at my house. We drink, joke around, and watch old movies deemed to be ""important to film"". Good times.

The problem: one friend (23f) has been through an awful trauma recently which has affected her profoundly. Our group has really huddled around her to make sure she is okay and lend our support any way we can... but... in the last few times we got together she got triggered by the graphic scenes in the films we were watching and politely asks that we stop. (The first time was Rosemary's Baby and the second was Taxi Driver, if that matters.)

Of course we all wanted to be sensitive so both times we immedietly turned it off and the group quickly dispersed after (kind of a bummer). Independantly, friends from the group have asked that I not invite her the next time, because we want to watch Clockwork Orange which will definetly be triggering to her. Since I'm hosting, it is up to me, but since I usually invite everyone via a group chat that she is in, it would require some maneuvering to exclude her.

God I feel like such a dick but my friends and I really want to be free to watch what we want without worrying about making her uncomfortable. WIBTA if I went out of my way to NOT invite her?

Tldr: My friends and I want to watch movies that our traumatized friend may find triggering - WIBTA to just not invite her anymore?

EDIT: Wow. So it took just 45min for me to realize Im an asshole! Some smart commenter posted an obvious solution: i will be using https://www.unconsentingmedia.org/ from now on to vet our films before movie night.

To make things easier, assume my name is ""Dan Harris"". There is another ""Dan Harris"" who lives in my general area. He got in a car wreck and was seen by the hospital who then sent me a bill.

To make it perfectly clear - I was not in a car accident nor seen by this hospital.

Because his car accident required xrays, the hospital shared my (the wrong persons) information with this third party radiology group.

The hospital has fixed the mistake and is no longer coming after me for payments, but the radiology group is refusing to fix it saying that the information they have is correct and I am on the hook for it. They sent me his medical information, what he had done, etc. They refuse to call the hospital to find out and the hospital is refusing to call them to tell them.

Is there some sort of easy-button I can press here? I'm not ducking out on debt, I am literally saying ""wrong person, fix your stuff"" and getting nowhere. Pretty sure they are going to send this to collections if I don't do something soon. I refuse to pay for someone elses accident and I do NOT want my records mingled with this other ""Dan Harris"" - to put it bluntly it would be very bad if our records were mixed.

My brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. What actions should I take against him?,"Hello. I'm a first-time poster, and I'm also on mobile. I am 19, and I currently live in New York City.

My parents died when my brothers and I were young (Eldest was 11, Second (the brother in question) was 7, and I was 5). They left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. I turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. It was in March 2019 that I finally got it. It turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. I decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. I wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

Yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. I called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after I deposited the money. My savings account has also been taken from. I'll admit, I really should have been paying more attention, but I was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and I got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. We tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. He had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

When I confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. He spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. I know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. It's just line after line of Uber Eats, Postmates, and game purchases. My grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. It would take YEARS for him to make that money back on minimum wage. Should I call the police and have him arrested? Is there any way to get that money back?


Edit: Okay, I've decided to call the police and sue the bank. I know how to get my hands on bank statements, and I'll record him confessing to the theft. But I don't know how to hire a lawyer. Where do I start?

Edit #2: Okay I just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. My grandma sends him to the store with her ATM card sometimes to get money. He memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

Edit #3: Thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. I got a ton of messages and I'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

I've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. We're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. Haven't gotten him arrested yet, but I told her if need be, I would call them myself.

I like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. My mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. She explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. She had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an ATM.

Edit #4: So I went to the bank. Because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. No case to sue the bank with. There's nothing I can do to get the money back. I'm ruined financially. All I can do is sue him and put him in jail, but I'm never gonna see that money again. I'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and I'm sorry if I haven't responded to your messages yet. Also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. This will be the last edit I make, hopefully.",legaladvice

"Hey Assholes, you're doing it wrong.","Since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time I ranted about voting on this sub. So, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: Welcome to the sub! Second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

You may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **Upvote real dilemmas**. If you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the OP is an asshole or not, **UPVOTE IT**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **Upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. If you see a post where you think the OP is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **UPVOTE IT** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **Stop rewarding validation posts**. Upvotes are not a political statement. They aren't something you give because the OP is really nice. Every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the OP is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the OP, they're ruining the sub. If you want to tell OP they're great, write an NTA comment and praise them all you want. Don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. Give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

As you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. Judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. What makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. This is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. Please be the better person and vote correctly here. Interesting content depends on it!  (If you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

Also important: In the comments, show a little backbone. **Don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** If you say the post is NTA, and someone else says it's ESH, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. If you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. There are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. The whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. If you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and GTFO. You have come to the wrong place.

P.S. If you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. Maybe you're not an asshole after all.

My wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! I'm growing very worried,"Posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

Title says it all. We've been married for 3 years now. She's always been one for quirky, ""against-the-grain"" thinking and interests. However, it's not just harmless things like believing there's no gold in Ft.Knox, taking pictures of trash in ""aesthetic poses"", or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... No, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. But now there's this anti-vax bullshit. 

She got sucked into one of those anti-vax Facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she's worked at a fucking Wawa for 10 years. She messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on Facebook. 

I love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. Shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her Vitamin K shot, and the Hep-B vaccine. However, now She's refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

I know that in her mind, she's coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we've had a number of arguments already. All her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

""Oh well if you look this graph you'll see that the numbers of cases for <X disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <Y vaccine>""

""I'm the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, I know I'm right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc..."" 

I've tried explaining to her the basic idea of ""correlation doesn't equal causation."" By showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. She followed that one up with ""We aren't talking about ice cream and murder, we're talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! They're completely different!""

I've tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn't as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. She follows that up with ""Those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and ""big-pharma""

She won't budge and hasn't budged for weeks now. Our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and I'm worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could've been easily avoided. 

I am in Florida. Is there anyway I can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife's knowledge? What are my options here? Legally speaking, what kind of leeway do I have? I don't want this to lead to divorce but I just feel quite lost at the moment. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone for your advice! I come to the decision that I will try and sit my wife down one last time, as I am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome I desire. If that fails, I have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because I know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child.

Okay so when I was first hired on at my job (6 years ago) I was given a key that had access to some of the internal offices which hold sensitive information.  I was told that if I ever lost said key I would owe the company $15,000 to have the entire building rekeyed due to security.

I have lost this key.  (It was attached to my car keys which were hooked to the loop of my pocketbook. I was mugged and the key was stolen along with a lot of other personal belongings.) 

So now my boss and my boss' boss and his boss keep calling me to come in and fill out paperwork to get on a payment plan to repay the ""money I owe.""   I have received letters from their official letterhead and I am informed the next step will be termination and lawsuit. And they have also threatened to start docking my pay.  

I have no intention of paying the fine.

The catch is that I was told this was the consequence verbally when I was handed the key.  My supervisor told me ""you will need to sign an agreement at some point but we'll worry about that later.""   I replied with ""to be clear, I will not be paying that if I haven't signed yet.  Do you want to keep possession of the key until then?""  My supervisor laughed as though I was joking and said it was more convenient for me to just hold on to it and he wouldn't forget to have me sign, he promised.

Well he never brought it up again and I of course did not either.  

My question is.  Can I be legally forced to uphold this on the basis of ""verbal contract?"" At this point I have not reminded them that I never signed.  I have simply ignored them.  But I worry we will have to get lawyers involved soon and I'm not sure how to proceed.  I will be visiting my lawyer Monday.  So hopefully more answers then.

[MA] A restaurant manager purposefully switched out my celiac boyfriend's non-gluten meal with a normal one due to her disbelief that he was intolerant,"So I wrote about this last night just after it happened on another subreddit, and was advised by many of the comments to post here for some clarity on what recourse we could actually seek from this.

I won't be writing out the whole incident again in as much detail as before, but if anyone reads my earlier post and thinks I've missed out something crucial, I'll be happy to edit the post.

My boyfriend and I went out for lunch yesterday at a restaurant we have dined at before. My boyfriend is a diagnosed celiac and has been for many years, and when this place was recommended to us originally we were told the restaurant has specific gluten free items, and a specific area where such food was prepared to avoid cross contamination. We had a great time, and checked online before going back again yesterday and saw there were no complaints about people being 'glutened'. We arrived and ordered our meals, with my boyfriend specifically ordering a gluten free appetizer and entree, something that the waitress stated would come with a different sauce than advertised as the usual sauce was made in the general area of the kitchen and as such could be contaminated.

We have no issues until the entrees come, when my boyfriend is served a dish of pasta with the advertised sauce. The waitress thinks that there's been a mix up in the kitchen, and comes back a minute later to say that someone else has received his gluten free pasta and the kitchen were rushing out a new order. She said she'd comp our appetizers and try to get us a free dessert, something she'd have to check with the shift manager on first. We see her go over to someone we assume is the manager, and then minutes later the manager storms over and asks us what kind of scam we're pulling. She says that the pasta was definitely gluten free, and we tell her that because of my boyfriend's celiacs we were told that the normal sauce wasn't safe and were waiting on a new dish with a new sauce. She started to complain about fad eating and sensitive customers (something we attributed to us being young and therefore 'millennials'). The waitress came over with the new dish with the new sauce, but the manager snatched it from her and started to walk it back into the kitchen saying that the 'precious table' couldn't be served something that she hadn't checked. She came back a few minutes later with what we assumed was the same dish and wouldn't give it over to my boyfriend initially, sarcastically asking if she wasn't us to drag away the chef from their job and tell us ourselves it was safe. We said it was fine, and rushed to finish so we could get out of there, probably finishing our meals in about 10 minutes.

We flagged down our original waitress and asked for the check. She was a little while, and when she came back to us she looked like she'd seen a ghost. She told us that she'd gone back to the kitchen to check on another order, and noticed a pasta dish that looked exactly like the one my boyfriend had eaten sitting on the side. She asked if it needed to go out, and was told that it was the one the manager had brought back about 15 minutes before. The waitress said that she thought it had been brought back out to the customer, but was told that the manager had only come in and asked the chef working with pasta dishes to simply drain some normal, gluten-containing pasta and serve it with the gluten free sauce (my boyfriend had ordered a tortellini style dish and there was a similar one on the regular menu, so he wouldn't have noticed by appearance or taste alone).

The waitress had comped all of the food on our check, but I insisted that we paid for my dishes, and tipped her well over the average, just in case she was penalised for the manager's mistakes. She went above and beyond what was necessary by telling us the truth to help us in preparing for my boyfriend's future 'glutened' state.

My boyfriend started having a reaction just before we got home, and spent the rest of the evening locked in the bathroom having a serious response to eating a whole bowl of gluten. As of this morning the worst is over, but he is still having serious stomach pains that will be occurring for the next few weeks at the very least.

On my original post, I was given many different types of advice; I was told to both post and not post a scathing review, to sue and not sue the restaurant, and to get the police involved over a 'poisoning' incident or just go all vigilante on the manager. As I have been looking after my boyfriend all night, I have not been able to research any further, legal ways of dealing with this. As a note, my boyfriend has not and will not be going to the ER or doctor about this - we already have everything we could possibly need to manage this, and it would simply be wasting time and money. However, if people advise that we need medical 'proof', we will be happy to pursue that.


TL;DR - My celiac boyfriend was purposely 'glutened' by an irate manager who didn't believe he needed a specialist meal, who and what should we pursue to get this manager fired and the restaurant investigated?",legaladvice

AITA for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?,"[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

So, I got into Cornell last week. Honestly I think it was fluke. I'm not smart, at all. I got a 28 ACT, a decent GPA (because my school grade inflates considerably). I had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like Cornell. But anyways...

My twin sister is the opposite of me. She's a GENIUS, she has way more impressive stats (34 ACT and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. Everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. I didn't and still don't mind, it's true. The only reason I can fathom I got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while I applied to Arts and Sciences (I don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with Cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

Well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  Unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (Cornell). She checked as SOON as it was available and called me bawling. I consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

Well anyways, I pretty much resolved that I was getting rejected, so I didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. Well, I guess surprises do happen sometime, because I'm a Cornellian. I got in. I just don't know how but I did. 

I really want to go guys. But this would devastate my sister. All week she's been crying and solemn and sad. She's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  She's decided to go to NYU, but she just hasn't been herself. I haven't told our parents (I think they assumed I didn't get in because she didn't). 

Am I being selfish? Should I just go with her to NYC? We always thought we were going to school together but like... it's Cornell. I couldn't in a million years imagine I'd get in. I've been researching obsessively about it and I can't shake the desire that if I don't go, I'll regret it. Ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which I would LOVE to get away with from the huge city that is New York). It seems like a dream opportunity. 

Am I being a bad sister? I KNOW she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. It would crush her. I really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. AITA for going to her dream school? Especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

TLDR: dumb sister (me) gets into Cornell. Smart sister didn't. She's depressed. It was her first choice. I want to go tho. AITA?

UPDATE: so everyone here told me that I should go, so I decided to tell my sister. 

Well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't I tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

But seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. She went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. Like uncontrollably bawling. I tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

I going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

Update 2: Please let me know if my updates are annoying; I only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so I thought least I could do is update 

So after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. It said:

> I'm sorry for how I reacted; please don't be mad. I'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. It's just that after I got rejected, I at least had the consolation that I get to go to school with you and we can go together. But now you're going to be where I wanted to be and I'm just so sad. I worked so hard and did everything I could to go to the best school I can and I just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. I'm sorry I'm ranting I just need more time

I'm not going to lie guys, when I read this, I cried. A lot of you are saying that I obviously I have to have attributes that made me desiresble but I really don't. I don't deserve my acceptance. I did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest AP classes available, etc. Meanwhile I see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. She deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. I'm really strongly just considering going to NYU with her. Everyone at Cornell will just be just like her and I don't stand a chance. And I know if I go to Cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and I just don't want to lose my sister :(

Update 3: So I told my parents and they did NOT react how I would've expected them to. First, they tried to insist that Cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be IMPOSSIBLE; if we applied to the same school within Cornell, like we both applied to Arts and Sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. They couldn't have mixed them up). 

Then they went on to explain how I should go to NYU with my sister. I thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to Cornell if I didn't get in. My sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would I not go to Cornell, and they said how it was unfair that I basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. I don't know if I'm being dramatic, but that hurt. I knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that I don't deserve my spot sucks. Even though they're probably right.

I stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. She asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that I 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. My parents were SHOCKED because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. This started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. I'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. I realize that I have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. I'm glad I have my sister actually believe in me.

I still don't know if I want to go to NYU or Cornell, mostly because I just don't want to go to school without her. She's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. At the end of the day, I ALWAYS thought the NYU was going to be the school I was going to, so I wouldn't lose much by choosing it over Cornell. I'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. Thanks again everybody for your comments; I wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that I got in.

Update 3.5: No new news but I just wanted to say that I'm reading every single comment and I apologize if I don't get to you individually and I appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! You guys are amazing :)",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by giving myself a huge hickey on my forehead... With a dildo,"This literally just happened. 

My girlfriend and I decided to spice up our sex life by ordering some sex toys online, the main piece being a veiny 7"" silicone dildo. 

So the package gets delivered while I'm at home and the gf's at work. I unbox said dildo to check it out. The thing's astonishingly life like with a big ass suction cup, so I stick it on the coffee table. Yup works as advertised. 

This is when the idiot man-light bulb goes off over my head. 

I stick it smack dab in the middle of my forehead and sit there, laughing maniacally like the idiot, dildo headed unicorn I am before I snap a picture to send to the girlfriend. 

By then I realized my idiocy had reached record levels and went to yank it off. The sucker was really on there, so I yank pretty hard before realizing what I was doing. I stop and peel at the edges and it comes off, but my fears had come true. I look in the camera again and I've got a huge purple hickey about 3"" in diameter right in the middle of my forehead. It also hurts a little bit.

I've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. Cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. For example, I have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and I can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. But once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

Similarly, there was I time I had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. This goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. Properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.",LifeProTips
Working forcing me to give them (not donate) my blood (Pennsylvania),"Hello legaladvice

I know the answer to ""can my work fire me for....."" is almost always yes in the U.S., but this seems really wrong.

&#x200B;

I'm a phlebotomist in a hospital in Pennsylvania. I report to the laboratory supervisor. Recently I had to have some tests done. We are given a discount for having things that like done in our own hospital so of course I did. For medical privacy, I'd prefer not to go into what exactly, but it turned out I have something rare about my blood. I never told anyone this at work, but everyone found out anyway. My supervisor approached me excitedly, saying that they have to calibrate some kind of analyzer pretty frequently and that my blood worked as a positive control to save on some expensive chemical they have to buy to normally calibrate it. I laughed this off thinking she used my blood once to calibrate her machine. It turns out she is expecting to take my blood on a regular basis (at least weekly is the impression I got) to calibrate this machine. When I told her I wasn't ok with that, she got upset and stormed off to her office. She called me in later and told me I would be saving the lab a ton of money if I did this. I once again told her no. Now she has started dropping hints that the lab is in financial trouble and cuts will have to be made. I asked around to other phlebotomists and she hasn't said anything to them about these cuts.

AITA for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?,"About two months ago, my husband and I got ""married"" in a beautiful ceremony. It was SO MUCH FUN. We went on a honeymoon after. The price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it's their only daughter's wedding. As a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or I could afford! My husband and I paid the rest ‚Äî his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

The wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. About a year and a half ago, I was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). I had recently graduated from school and didn't have health insurance. My husband and I decided to get married so I could join his health insurance. It was a quick Justice of the Peace ceremony. We were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. A few months after that, he ""proposed"" (something I didn't see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

Very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. We weren't trying to be deceptive. However, part of it was that I wasn't comfortable revealing my health issues. My husband respected this. My parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. His mom (I'll call her Carol) and I aren't close. She's fine enough in low doses, but...

We're currently in the process of moving. This past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. As we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must've slipped out. Carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. And then she noticed the date. 

Carol lost it. She insisted we lied to everyone. She said our wedding ceremony was just a ""gift grab"" (our wedding website stated that someone's presence was gift enough‚Äî we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). Carol went and called her twin sister, my husband's aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. She said we were sneaky and deceptive. She is saying she may want her gift back‚Äîsomething we are fine with giving her. 

For me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so I could get insurance. A means to an end. Our wedding date is what we will celebrate. Are we assholes for not being more upfront? I've been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. My husband insists we are not assholes.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by unintentionally betraying the trust of my new kitten. (NSFW)?,"Obligatory, wasn't today, but 2 days ago.

So my gf and I adopted a new kitten a week ago. She's a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or I go. She also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.

Well my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and I had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as I had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. So I went into the bathroom and began to pee. As I was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all I could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. I looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. I started screaming ""OH FUCK!"" And managed to pinch off my stream. The kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as I pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. This all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.

It took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. I set her in the tub and I had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. I got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. The last few nights I've woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. I dont know what shes planning, but I'm sure she'll get her payback sooner or later.

My girlfriend thinks it's the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she's still a little salty that I pissed on our new kitten..

TL:DR - I gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... To my new kitten...

A lot has happened over the last ten days.

I realized, shortly after making my initial post that my life, as it is, has become unsustainable.  I cannot live like this anymore.  And I mean that literally, because this realization came to me just before i hurt myself very badly.

I was sitting in my bathtub and it suddenly struck me that I was completely prepared to just stop living because I was too scared to find help.  So I went and found help.  

I took all of last week off and with my ex-husband's help, I found a good, understanding and very very patient therapist.  I've also made an appointment to see a psychiatrist, to see what medication options are open to me.

When I finally went back to work, I took the head of the Fun Committee aside and talked to her.  I explained to her that I have PTSD and some very severe anxiety issues and I apologized for not being more clear to her when I asked her not to do anything for my birthday.

And she cried.  She wept openly and apologized, she told me she thought I was just shy, that she was just trying to help me fit in and she never intended to do anything hurtful to me.  

Then, I spoke to my Manager and my workspace is being moved to a far less-populated part of the building, where I can just quietly do my work and be left alone.  It is literally all I have ever wanted.

So, the moral of this story was, fucking talk to people about your shit before it gets so bad you feel like you have no choice but fucking die.  Apparently.

I opted for a playful serious way to talk about it with her, so I told her that I had a micropenis and that I was serious. She asked me how big it was and I said that it was in the 2 inch region, give or take a bit. She said that she didn't expect it to be so small and that she wished I told her sooner, but she said that it's okay as long as I make it up to her in other ways. ;)

Anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. I trust her ENTIRELY, I know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

Anyway, I went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order.

She recently brought up the idea of getting a tattoo of the first letter of my name on her wrist 

Im all for her doing what she wants with her body, and i really want to be with her

But i just dont think its the smartest thing 

We are very stable however i just dont think tattoos of a lover are a good idea especially since we are such a young age 

How should I approach telling her i dont think its a good idea and not making her think its because i don't believe in our relationship?

Edit: wow lol posted this before going to bed and just woke up to all this shame all the karma on a throw away account

Edit 2: will definitely be getting her a necklace as someone recommended, forgot who and will also talk to her about getting some sort of other tattoo! ",relationship_advice
[Update] My (28F) boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) are going on a week-long vacation. They uninvited me.,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/copzwa/my_28f_boyfriend_29m_and_his_best_friend_29f_are/)

Update, as promised.

I was really upset the day I dropped him off and he was texting me but I wasn't responding. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do, but I didn't want to do anything at all in the state I was in. I waited until the next day, and then I sent him a thought out text letting him know that I didn't feel safe or loved in the way the trip was handled and that I would be dropping his things off at his place and leaving his keys with the neighbor. He called but didn't leave any messages and then he messaged me that he didn't understand.

The rest of the week, he called and messaged me, but I couldn't bring myself to pick up or text back. On Thursday, I think that he realized that I was serious, and he asked me some questions about logistical things ‚Äî I told him which neighbor his key was with, etc.

When he got back and saw all his things at his place, he got pretty frantic and called and left me a long message. I was working all day, but also I still didn't want to respond. He asked me to explain because he didn't understand what was going on. The next day, I sent another text making it clear that it was over, and he got upset and sent me a bunch of texts in a row about how he didn't understand why I was throwing away everything that we built. He left me a voicemail that was really angry that said he had no idea why I was upset and that he did not accept the break-up because he had no say in it and that he wanted me to tell him the evil story that I had made up about him to his face.

I wasn't going to respond to him and I wanted to remain calm, but this upset me. So I sat down to write him this letter. It's long, so skip over if you want. I tried to call him but I started crying and told him I'd just send him an email instead. This is what it said.

""The time that we have had apart has given me some good space and time to think. I have had a chance to think about the things that are important for me in a relationship and I see that we should not be together. I am sorry that I have been asking for you to change things about your life that you shouldn't have to change at my or anyone's behest.

From the very start, this trip was made in an insanely disrespectful way in which it started out from you being given an ultimatum by your female best friend who I had never met that either she goes or I go on this trip, and you picked her. You didn't offer to have her meet me (theoretically I was your long-term partner, so this would have made a lot of sense), you didn't encourage her to find someone else to come, and you didn't consult me at all. That's enough for most people to have a deal-breaker, right there. However, I stayed.

This is a person who you have a history with that is not entirely clear to me. Here is what I understand: some bad rumors got started about the two of you in which you spent an entire night out with her on an acid trip while you were dating someone else. Nothing happened. The other thing I understand is that you were interested in her romantically at some, theoretically other, point and that she started dating her boyfriend and that closed the door on things for you. According to what I also understand, it took a long time for 29F's boyfriend to feel comfortable with you being around, but you apparently worked to ultimately make him feel comfortable with you after I'm not sure how long. This is the completely unknown person who shut me out of a trip that I was originally going to go on (unilateral decision). You did not tell me this was happening until I asked when the trip to Hawaii would be.

You purchase tickets in another very disrespectful situation in which I have cooked dinner and have guests present, and you choose to go into my room for well over an hour to select tickets with her, and in which I repeatedly ask you to please come to dinner because you say it will just be a few more minutes each time. There is absolutely no reason for doing it at that time and in that situation, seeing as how she is in the same time zone as us and has a 9-5 job. This makes me feel sick to my stomach.

So, to make myself feel better about this whole arrangement, I tell you that I want to meet this person. On my request, we arrange a trip to go meet her and her boyfriend ‚Äî a brief trip in which they are (and you explicitly agree) inexplicably cold. The first conversation that we have is one in which 29F and her boyfriend argue about how she dm'ed him while he was already in a relationship and got him to date her instead. You tell me about conversations that 29F has had with you recently in which it seems implied that there is some real instability in their long-term relationship ‚Äî stuff about kids and dogs. I have a discussion in which I let you know that I see that and that it worries me.¬†

Meanwhile, I am still wanting all of this to work out for you and for me and for her. I, at this point, am planning on being with you for the long term and see no benefit in telling you to not go on a trip with your best friend. I want it to work out. But each and every interaction surrounding this trip chips and chips and chips away at my ability to handle it: the conversations that seem to go nowhere, etc. Your dad, your mom, and your grandparents are all very surprised when we tell them about this trip. It is becoming very obvious that this is a dangerous trip to make with the fragility of our relationship. 29M, we had only been together for nine months. How long did it take before 29F's boyfriend was comfortable with you hanging around? Much less going on a one-on-one international tropical vacation in which he was uninvited because of your request?

We go over it with (friend) at the rock climbing gym, we go over it in the car, we go over it while we're booking our AirBnb for Copenhagen, we go over it when I tell you that I still feel uncomfortable and I do not feel good about the trip. Talk about repeatedly saying something! Although I ask for you to help me, you actually ask me instead to come up with what would make me feel better. Surprisingly, I have no ideas either.¬†

Ultimately, it appears that the original plan to meet at my place and hang out and do a game night before you two go on the trip has been canceled, and 29F will be staying at my place, but not hanging out with us at all beforehand. You attribute it to you not bringing it up with her early enough. This is apparently not something that was discussed even two nights before the trip. This upsets me. You do not know what to do. I don't blame you ‚Äî at this point, it was well out of hand. I don't know what to do either. There is no good solution that I can think of besides waiting for the trip to be over. I tell you that either I have to get over it, or I have to break up with you, and that I don't want to break up with you. But my ability to get over it is rather rather rather worn down.¬†

She arrives at my place very late, and we wake up the next morning for me to take the two of you to the airport. After all of this lead-up, I know that you can tell how unhappy I am. I fully absolutely know you can tell how unhappy I am. You leave, and when I don't respond to your text messages, you text me to tell me that you hope I'm okay and you're going to bed. No call.

The rest of the week was rough. My text to you was met with, essentially, ""I'm sorry you feel this way."" You tell me that I'm being unfair.

There is no acknowledgment (and there still has been none) that this trip to a fucking honeymoon destination, as we have discussed before, could be a crazy and horrible thing to go through with, even with my quasi-blessing. This is not something that people in relationships have to deal with. This is not something that people in relationships do, besides 29F, I guess.

In the end, all of this is to say that I have felt serious emotional needs go seriously unmet in a way that is a deal-breaker for me.

There have been some wonderful, very positive times, but there has been an unnecessary amount of heartache and suffering for me over things that come down to what I can only assume are personal differences.

I cannot handle your relationship with 29F. And I suppose I could ask you to pick between her and me, but that's not what I want to do. I want you to have your best friend, and I want to leave. I did love you, but I am not about to fight this fight and hear you tell me that I'm crazy for not seeing how totally platonic everything is for the rest of my life.

It seems like trying to convince someone to like different food, or to have a different favorite color. I am not happy in this, and I do not want to feel these feelings any longer.

There is no need for this to be mutual. I do not need your permission to break up with you.""

He wrote me back an apologetic email in which he accepted responsibility for most things without any argument, except he denied anything that had to do with his relationship with her making me feel uncomfortable and he denied that I would not be able to handle their relationship.

He said that the only thing that made their trip bad for me was my own perspective.

I wrote him back that trust has to be built and that he put too much strain too early on a relationship in which we had not developed that trust.

He agreed and apologized. For me, it ended on a pretty amicable note, but this style of relationship really doesn't work for me and I don't feel like his responses to me really healed or changed anything significantly. I stand by my decision at this point.

TLDR: We broke up.",relationship_advice
AITA for eating a lot at a wedding buffet?,"I (17M) eat a good amount of food. Based on my body type and physical activity, I've been eating well over 4,000 calories a day to maintain my current weight.

My aunt got married last weekend in a venue close to my parents' house. It was originally scheduled for the morning, but problems with catering and the venue/DJ meant that they rescheduled it for that evening at the last minute.

This was problematic because I needed to attend my afternoon swim practice that day, as I had only been excused for the morning one. I ended up going to both practices, had to change into my tux right outside the weight room, and drove directly there. I only ate a protein bar during the drive, so I was thrilled to find a well-stocked buffet after the reception.

I loaded my plate, then went back for seconds. I was going to get a third round when my mom pulled me aside. She had been giving me weird looks during the meal, and told me to cut it out, and that if I was still hungry I could make something when we got home.

Now, I would have ordinarily agreed with her, but when we helped chip in for the wedding, we paid for two meals instead of one for me. I ate a good amount, but I doubt it was more than double whatever everyone else was eating.

She eventually gave in and let me get a third serving. I would have eaten more, but she put her foot down. There was still some extra food left once the meal service ended.

Once we left, my mom went on a rant about how I was ""making aunt and her fiancee fund my cheat day."" I told her that it was the guests paying for the catering, not them, and I wasn't depriving anyone else since I went back for more once most people were done.

I'm not sure if I violated some social norm, but I feel like I was justified. AITA, Reddit?

EDIT: I don't know if this matters, but I was mainly eating chicken and lamb, not veggies or rice/bread. There was still some leftover, though.",AmItheAsshole
"My niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her.","Located in Oklahoma, USA

My sister and I have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. Our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. My niece told my sister about it when she got home. My sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. So they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

The principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. The only thing I can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? They risked my niece's safety and I think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but I'm not sure what could be done.

Update: My sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. The board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. The school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution.

HELP: I slept with a guy nearly 48hrs ago and he won't leave my place!!!!,"Update here for alk who asked: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/apawjv/update_i_slept_with_a_guy_48hrs_ago_and_now_he/?utm_source=reddit-android

I am recently out of a long-term relationship, and its been a long time since I have 'dated', so I have been meeting guys from Tinder for hook-ups and dates. I went on a date with this guy on Friday night, and it was okay, he seemed nice and we ended up going back to mine and hooking up. Anyway...fast forward to, well, NOW, and the dude is STILL HERE. I'm used to a guy staying for a while the next day, having coffee or whatever, but he slept over Saturday night too, and now I'm worried he is going to end up staying tonight too. He's been here way too long now and I have no idea how to get rid of him. He used my toilet, and I had forgotten to put more paper in there...he called me to the toilet to give him some paper because he shit in my toilet. HE SHIT IN MY TOILET. That's how long he's been here...he's had a shit. Idk I just think one nighters have overstayed their welcomes when they shit at your place. 

I have politely said on Saturday 'I have a lot to be getting on with today', and 'I have some errands to run', but he didn't get himself ready to go or anything, and I really don't wanna leave him in my place unattended. I even got dressed, put my coat on and told him I was going out and he just asked if I could grab him a coffee on my way back (!!!!!!). I did say today that he should probably leave soon as I need to get myself sorted for work Monday, and he just said 'yeah no problem'...but that was 3 hours ago and he is still chilling in my bed watching TV.

I'm really worried now because I need to go to work tomorrow and I'm scared that he won't EVER leave. I told him that I need to work Monday and he just changes the subject and asks about my work. How do I get him to leave? I've been in situations before where guys have turned in a bad way when I have refused advances, not given them my number etc, only this is worse because he is in my apartment and I am worried that he might turn nasty when we are alone. 

Probs worth noting that I suspected nothing at dinner on Friday night, he didn't seem like a weirdo or anything. Guess I didn't realise I'd be gaining a live-in boyfriend after one date and some drunk mediocre sex. What is the best way to deal with all of this?

TIFU by stumbling on my 19 y/o sons reddit and reading through it.,"Dear lord. On my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so I clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  I click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

This is my sons account. It has to be. The comment he posted is about something that happened while I was there. He had a more detailed post about that specific day. He had another previous post about an event in his life I knew about and knew some details about. He had a few other posts which I also read. 

I now know what gets him going sexually. Not something I needed to know.

I know what his girlfriend likes sexually. Also, not something I needed to know. Also quite surprising. 

I know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. I feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

I know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife's room.

In reading through the comments he's made to others, I've learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. I feel very proud about that.

Overall, I wish I never clicked that first comment. I know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

TL;DR. Accidentally discovered my son on reddit. Found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, I shouldn't have read all of it. And some posts I stayed away from. And honestly, I didn't realize it right-right away. The first post I read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. It was after another that I really put the pieces together. And yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. But hey, life isn't always fair. I also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything I read.**",tifu
TIFU by tipping my pizza delivery driver $1100,"So today I sold my bitcoin I bought 2 years ago I spent like $100 on the investment or something, I cashed it out at a bitcoin atm and brought it home the first thing I did to celebrate was buy some edibles. I buy some edibles eat a whole brownie and am out of it, I order some pizza and take some money from my wad and put it in a pile on the table next to me total was like 20 so I put 23.

Since I'm high af the pizza delivery girl knocks I grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. I give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this is going to help me. Freaked out and high I say okay and just rush inside.

Right now after waking up being passed out I realize what I've done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.

TL;DR - I tipped my pizza delivery driver $1100 while high on brownie edibles by accident and have no money to pay for my bills now

Edit: Thanks for all the nice comments and the reddit gold kind stranger. I just woke up and this post just blew up. I could never call the pizza place and ask for the money back, with how happy it made the women and the fact it was my own dumb mistake it just wouldn't feel right in my head, I would rather be late on my bills and figure anything else out then do that.

TIFU by dropping off my dog at a kid's summer camp,"Technically yesterday and not today, but YIFU sounds like some odd anime genre so...

So it's summer, which means my 6yo daughter goes to summer camp. I was dropping her off at about 8ish and I was also going to drop my dog off at doggie daycare because the gardeners are coming today and they don't appreciate her trying to protect them from those murderous rakes and lawnmowers. For the record, the dog is a 13 year old black lab / pit bull mix.

Anyway, stopped at the summer camp. My daughter grabbed the dog's leash and walked her to the drop off desk to show her to her friends. I signed my daughter in and then I.... just drove off. In my defense, well, I got nothing. Honestly, I just forgot the dog there.

So my wife picks up our daughter in the afternoon and is quite surprised to find the dog there with her. Apparently, the dog (and the kids) had a great day at summer camp. I now have pictures of my dog participating in such activities as ""paint a rock"" (she did not do very well on this one), ""learning about dinosaurs"" (did not participate) and ""digging for fossils"" (which was right in her sweet spot of digging bones out of dirt). She also enjoyed water activities and apparently stole some snacks. She got a free shirt and we got a picture of her wearing the shirt with her camp team wearing identical shirts. All in all, could have gone worse.

Edit - I get it, you want to see pics of the dog at camp.  Sorry, but no can do.  Pics include other people's kids and I'm not going to post that.  Also, I think posting the pic would make it easy for my friends to figure out who this account belongs to and I've said way too much shit I regret on Reddit for that to happen.  Just use your imaginations.  She's half black lab, half pit although she looks mostly like a lab.  Muzzle almost completely white due to being 13.  She's still very active and very kid friendly and water play with a pool and a dozen kids running around with a hose is pretty much her version of paradise.

Edit 2 - For those asking.  Yes, camp called me.  Twice.  And left VM's both times.  Number was not one I recognized so I didn't pick up or check VM (I know, TIFU!  Number is now programmed in).  Both messages were very polite and highly amused but they did ask if I could come pick the dog up.  I clearly did not so they just gave up and included her in the day's activities.  And yes, this whole thing could have gone a lot worse.  Huge HUGE props to the camp for making a good thing out of my fuck up.

Edit 3 - For those asking.  I did offer to pay for an extra day / kid but they said no.  So I left them an awesome review on Yelp and shared their link with friends with a very strong recommendation.

Edit 4 - Yah, I get it.  This could have gone a lot worse and kudos to the camp for making the best of it.  Yes, it was a mistake on my side.  That's why I'm posting it here and not on r/todayIwasawesome

Edit 5 - Holy crap.  Came back to see this hit the front page and my inbox has 500 messages.  I just want to take a moment and say thank you to my mom and dad for having sex with each other and making this moment possible.  

TL;DR - Dropped dog off at kiddie summer camp by mistake. Dog had a great time and I think she's now a camp counselor.",tifu
Update to: Someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when I was underage and I'm terrified that I'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (Ohio),"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

So as the title states, last year I was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when I was 14/15. I thought I would update now that it's come to a resolution.

I went to see a lawyer the day after I made that post. He drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that I had nothing to worry about. It was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. Then I got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

I panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. He was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

Long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. He was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). I wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that I wasn't really allowed to know about.

Anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus I'm getting married in a few months and I'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. So I thought I'd update here with the good news! I was afraid that I'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys I got up the courage to deal with the situation. I really appreciate the advice I got here! Thank you again so much. ",legaladvice
"My pregnant wife blames her infidelity on ""pregnancy hormones""... What am I supposed to do with a baby on the way...","Title summarises it pretty much. For the last 3 months my life has been a living hell, my wife uses her pregnancy to defend making my life a living hell. Alongside the constant stream of demands during the day, almost every night for the last 3 months she wakes me up in the middle of the night to demand I make/buy her something she's craving. If I'm lucky it's something we have at home, often I find myself making 3am drives to 24hr gas stations or McDonalds despite starting work at 7:30 am. This even included making me fly from Wellington to Auckland to get her a stupid bloody giant ""big mac"" cookie because the store doesn't ship them to Wellington. She literally badgered me for a week before I finally relented and bought a plane ticket to get her the damn thing.

Anyway  sorry for the rambling, to the point of my problem. I found out she has been sexting guys she met on tinder. This all started after she got pregnant, and she is blaming pregnancy hormones for making her feel insecure/horny/etc etc. I know this excuse is probably bullshit, but fuck I'm a guy I have no idea about this sort of stuff.

If she wasn't pregnant I'd leave without saying another word to her. But she is. We have a kid on the way. I feel a moral obligation to make this work. The relationship was honestly MUCH BETTER before she got pregnant, so maybe she's telling the truth? Fuck me I'm rambling again.

TIFU by lending a hot girl my fav hoodie,"This sad tale literally just came to its bitter end.

So until 20 minutes ago I owned a gorgeous, bright yellow Death Grips hoodie that was my pride and joy. My mum bought it me for Christmas last year and it was my absolute favourite item of clothing.

Last night I went out with my mates and happened to meet an attractive Spanish girl who was just in Manchester for the weekend. We chatted for a bit and made out in the club smoking area as one does, then after a while she complained about the cold English weather. I predictably offered her my precious hoodie at this point. Fast forward a few hours and we exchange contact details as we planned to meet the next day to hang out, then she leaves the club. I realise she's still wearing the hoodie so run after her and ask for it back. 

This is where I make my fatal error, a fine example of thinking with your genitals instead of your head. I had the smart idea that if I let her keep the hoodie for the night, itll mean she HAS to meet me the next day and can't back out thus allowing me more time to charm her. I essentially used the jumper as fishing bait but didn't think that the fish could just eat said bait and swim away. *spoiler alert* This is what happened. 

The next day I awoke excited to spend some time with this girl and waited patiently for her to reply to my messages so we could arrange to meet. By 5 in the evening I start to get worried and message her again as well as asking her friend to reply to me. My messages get left 'seen' for about an hour before they both block me on all social media platforms shooting in the head any chance of me seeing my beautiful jumper ever again. 

To the Spanish girl who stomped on a nice gesture and on my heart, know that you have made me sad.

Minecraft is a genuinely fun and interesting game. It's not cringy or just for 12 year olds.,"I've been playing Minecraft for almost 10 years now. I remember the golden days with channels like ""SkydoesMinecraft"", ""ASFJerome"" and ""Bajancanadian"". I have always liked Minecraft, as it's a world where you can build literally anything, in your own little world. There's still a considerable amount of people that play it, but Minecraft has definitely been one of the highlights of my childhood. 

Edit 1: I see a lot of people claiming this as a popular opinion. Everyone knows that Minecraft has loads of hate around the game (generally the community) I see people all the time trashing the community, saying it's full of annoying squeakers and losers. The way i've seen it from my perspective is that this is an unpopular opinion.

Edit 2: A lot of people remember when there were all of the clickbait Herobrine videos and all of the little kids that ruined the community. The kids have mostly moved to Fortnite, but it still stands that Minecraft does get a lot of negative feedback. If I would have posted this on any other social media platform I would definitely have lots of negative comments and many people disagreeing with me.

Edit 3: I'm getting many comments saying how they left Minecraft because they thought it was boring at times. I can understand that, but i'll always find a time to come back to it.",unpopularopinion

"TIFU by trying to edit a headshot without permission, HR is involved.","TL;DR at bottom.

I work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. A portion of what I do is handling the corporate website. One of our mid-level professionals (I'll call her Gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. It's a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.

Every year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. It's one guy who does every office, and he's usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he'll do colour correction, but no retouching.

So, Gina's paper is being published, and I'm called on to do all the marketing around it. This includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.

The thing is, Gina's headshot is a little... off.

As a thumbnail, it's fine, but when it's zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. Not a little ""maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch"" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you'd expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.

So, I can't exactly call up and ask if I should do something about this, as it's not really a conversation I want to have, and I'm also not known as the most tactful person. I'm very familiar with Photoshop, and use it all the time (I've got no Graphic Design qualifications though, so I'm very slow by comparison), so I go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. I'm zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.

I work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. Still, it's not something I want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, I alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.

Lo and behold, Gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she's marked up. As she comes by, I hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. She comes in and freezes, asks what I'm doing. I say Im just tweaking a picture, and when I look at my own screen, it's zoomed right in on her cleavage.

She gets louder and asks what the fuck I'm doing fixing her chest area. She then asks if I'm making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. For some reason, I decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say I'm evening out the skin tone.

She dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.

About an hour later, I get an email from HR saying that I need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  I ask if I can speak privately first, and explain the situation. I still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that Gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it's sexist to try and ""make her prettier"". I acknowledge that, but also mention that I tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, I'm just trying to get out of the awkwardness. 

We have the meeting, and I had to explain the whole thing to Gina directly. She is adamant that she doesn't have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn't. She's sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). She then goes on to suggest that I altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn't dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).

I then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the HR rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.

She's still livid, and HR suggest that I should jump off this project. 

I'm actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. I told my boss the whole story and he's assured me I'll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.

TL:DR: Tried to edit a moustache out of a female colleague's professional headshot, didn't want to embarrass her by letting other people see, she walks by and I reflexively scroll down to hide the mouth and it looks like I'm zoomed in on her breasts. ",tifu
"Just because you are better at arguing, doesn't mean you're right.","I was √† German living in England for 7 years. Loved it. But whenever I had a an argument with people about politics or whatever people would ""win"" the argument simply because they delivered better than I did.

Me arguing in a foreign language obviously makes it much harder for me to get my point across. But even in my own language I struggle to explain well. However I don't think just because I don't talk well or don't use difficult words or studder here and there should ever take away from the argument I'm making. If people weren't so obsessed with showing off how clever they are they would let their counterpart finish what they have to say and listen  instead of seeing their insecurities or shortcomings as an apportunity to make them look stupid or overpower them and ""win"" the argument.

I mean what does that even mean ""win"" an argument. The point is to get to a consensus and not imposing your viewpoint.

If you talk to Somebody and they don't express themselves as nicely as you do, be the bigger person and let them talk and try and make their point. Your argument should rest only on the content and not on the delivery. And if you find that you can't win arguments if you don't use the trick of being super eloquent, maybe take it as an opportunity to learn and don't see it as defeat.",unpopularopinion

Parents took $6000 from me without my consent. Resulted in homelessness and prevented university education.,"I live in Alberta, Canada. About a year and a half ago, my family got a huge surprise from my great grandfather, who gave us each $5000 with the exception of my mother. I was 17 at the time, and my mother and uncle went to the bank with me to set up a joint account between me and my uncle since my great grandfather wrote the cheques in both mine and his name for some reason.

My father, who was an alcoholic at the time, stated that it would be best that all of the bank cards of the newly created accounts be in his and my mothers hands so that we wouldnt make reckless purchases. At the time, I didnt mind since I was planning to save the money for university, but the main reason I gave the card to them was because my father was not one to cross. Hes done things to me in the past, and ive been scared of him since.

All was fine until a couple months later when I decided to pitch into my savings with my job, only to find that the $5000 was gone through multiple purchases.

The tap function was on the card.

I confronted my mother immediately, away from my father, and she agreed to pay back $400 a month. However, this only happened for three months. Around the same time this started, my great grandfather, unaware of what happened, sent another $5000. Due to a plane ticket I bought to see my gf this August as well as a $500 slash to my paycheque, I was left with about $1000. However, after we transferred the money into my brothers account to keep my father as calm and stable as possible, his account was locked, my mother refusing to open the account.

I burst under the pressure, and was given the boot. While I was in the homeless shelter, i kept asking for the $1000 back to get shelter to find my mother already unlocked the account and gave it to my father. 

I had to drop my classes in high school right before the diplomas because of this. I was unable to get a credit card approved by the bank for application because of the ridiculous transactions, and found that my great grandfather was going to send another $10,000 before he learned of what my parents did. A couple months later, i was let back in, but now theyre telling me ""its gone, money is the root of all evil"". 

I lost my girlfriend after cancelling the trip, lost my university aspirations, and lost much more that id rather not reveal here. What should I do? 

UPDATE: After seeing all of the suggestions here and seeing just how many people apparently have my back, I decided to leave the house and go back to the youth shelter while I get myself a lawyer and gather the necessary evidence. Thank you all, I never thought this would blow up like this when I went to sleep last night. Knowing a couple thousand strangers have my back seems to give me more courage to go about with this action than I did before.

You see, I have about $650-700 in known debt right now, and they're asking me to pay $250 a month for a room even worse than the unfinished basement I was sleeping in before, and giving my mattress away, as I found out just now during the moving preparations. It's still $500 cheaper than the room I paid for per month after getting out of the shelter at my friend's place, but it doesn't feel right, especially with how they're consistently acting as if what they did was nothing. If you guys have any more advice, I'll be sure to take it and update you all with the situation. ",legaladvice

TIFU by wearing the wrong size shoes for my entire adult life.,"Okay, so by TIFU standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony I unintentionally put myself through, I think it qualifies.

I have fairly weird-sized feet.  They're very wide, but not all that long.  I have no arch to speak of.  I'm a fairly short guy, about 5'7"", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  I'm pretty short so I should be wearing a fairly small size, right?

Wrong.

When I was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure I had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.

As an adult, I assumed, well, since I'm full-grown, I should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  For me, that's a size 10 (US).

Problem was, I kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, I'll switch to size 10W.

Still no luck.  Still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  My running shoes were so ill-fitted that I actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.

My friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn't need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5W Nikes.  I said, ""Sure, fuck it, I'll take them, let's see how they fit.""

Oh.  My.  God.

It was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  I was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  I had no idea how much misery I had been in until I wore those shoes.  I wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because I was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn't realize it.  There's about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn't bother me at all.

TL;DR - I'm almost 36, and for fully 18 years I have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because I was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes.",tifu

Ive gotten a jillion messages from people offering everything from adoption to food to asking for updates so I thought I would tell you guys what ended up happening.the messages are still coming even now lol. I asked the people I am with if it was ok and they said yes but they made me let them read it first. It was kinda embarrassing but its ok. I kind of owe you all haha... 

My mother was charged with several things and is in jail but I dont think they actually put her in for the crimes yet. Like she's waiting on the police to get evidence I think. As many of you guys thought the only people in my family allowed school was my brother and me. My second brother was 2 so I dont know if she would have let them put him in school. My sisters had to stay home. This wasnt weird to me because it was an all boys school. 

They said I will never go back to my mom again and my siblings won't either. They also said what we were in was a cult. We were all in one big apartment building kind of thing. They said they weren't sure the cult itself was illegal. Just that some of the other stuff happening was. Drugs and that some of the stuff was probably sexual assault but I can't talk about it very much. Multiple people are in jail for it. Lots of people left and I think theyre looking closely at the pastor.

So its ok. Thank you all. I dont know if all 8 of us will stay together but we are safe now. Its weird but in a good way.

WIBTA if I (37f) tell my husband (38m) that he can follow the event dress code or just stay home?,"My side of the family is very close and ~~my~~ our niece (call her N) is getting married in a few months. The ceremony is halfway across the country and I've been saving for several months so our family of 5 can fly out for it. The venue is upscale and beautiful.

The ceremony will be a formal-ish event (she said it fits most closely with the [""cocktail"" definition here](https://www.theknot.com/content/wedding-guest-attire-cheat-sheet)). 

Husband doesn't *dress up*. He wore a tux for his best friend's wedding when he was 20 and that's the last time he's worn a tie. He wore jeans and a casual sport coat for our wedding (That was fine with me - it was his wedding too and the ceremony was immediate family only).

When I broke the news about N's wedding, adding that we'd rent a suit instead of making an otherwise useless purchase, he said ""No. I'm not wearing a suit. I guess I'll be the only one there not in a suit.""

I told him that if he won't wear the appropriate attire then he can just stay home and everyone will know that he's a whiny butt baby who thinks his personal preference is more important than a special family event for someone he says he loves. I added ""Nice priorities there, honey.""

* My mom and brother (N's dad) said YTA - just ask N if she cares, but they're sure she won't.
* N's mom says I'm NTA, but my delivery could have been better (I disagree - it was perfect for my husband).
* I don't have very many friends to ask, and I'm NOT asking N. Weddings are stressful enough without worrying about inconsiderate guest questions.

What do you think?

I really don't care that he's jeans, t-shirts and boots. We live in small town in the Midwest. Preachers and undertakers wear suits here.

I am afraid for my life and those of my children.,"My husband is active duty Navy. We have been married 11 years and have three boys together, ages 5, 2, and 2 months old.

He's always been verbally and emotionally abusive to me but lately it's escalated. In December he got mad out of nowhere while driving and began driving erratically. I thought we were going to crash. He pounded the steering wheel and broke the blinker handle thing off. When we got home he screamed at our 5 year old and kicked a hole in our wall. He'd never done that before. The next day I faked a pregnancy issue and had him take me to the hospital. I told my midwife what happened and asked for a social worker. CPS was called and investigated about two weeks right around Christmas. They closed the case despite me telling them that he'd said he would rather we all be dead than I leave him again. (We were separated for Sox months over a year ago.) They said he wasn't an immediate danger after speaking to our five year old and him having told them he was afraid of his dad. Since the case has closed my husband's behavior has not improved. I caught him pushing my two year old over on the sidewalk after he ran off. He grabbed my five year olds arm and shook it when he wouldn't drop his DS and left bruises. He has screamed at all of us and hinted that he would not let me leave alive.

We just moved into a new apartment and now he is underway until next week. I feel like this is a good time to do something but am scared of reporting him since nothing happened last time and because of the murder/suicide hints.

The only family I have is in Hawaii. We are in California. He has told me he will say I'm kidnapping of I try to go back with the kids.

I have no other family or friends

I have money set aside in cash, but no access to his income and he took me off our joint account last year.

When we were separated last year it was from an infidelity issue and I had found pictures of him naked under a tree by a park Inside our military housing. I don't know who took the pictures but I sent then to his command thinking they'd force him to get counseling. Instead they told him I was causing his career trouble. They didn't help us get access to income either and ultimately I came back last March because we were about to be homeless. I then got pregnant.

Then the demands started coming out. They wanted this, they wanted that, they wanted this person to come, these colors, dresses can't do this, this person has to be flower girl, this person HAS to be a groomsman, etc etc. Suddenly it didn't feel like our wedding, but an excuse for our families to have a family reunion.

TIFU by trying to gay up my new apartment and triggering a SWAT response.,"My partner and I pulled my car into the parking lot of the library. It was a hot summer day and we were there to use the WiFi and checkout a couple books and return a couple that were overdue. I'd been inside about ten minutes when some commotion started in the parking lot. My partner noticed and decided to go gawk at it while I finished up. 


Another five minutes go by and my partner hadn't returned. I'd seen a few police cars go by. I decided to go see what all the fuss was about. Heading to the door I notice they're all clustered near my car. ""Well this isn't good."" On closer examination I notice my partner approaching the group of officers. They'd just arrested some guy. Exiting I overheard the second half of the conversation. 


""... and then you entered that vehicle, the blue one?""


""Yes officer.""


""And took these items?""


""Yes officer."" 


""And you entered these vehicles?"" The officer motioned to the row of cars, including mine. 


""Yes.""


There wasn't much of value in my car. A few days prior we had picked up a few items at a garage sale for the new apartment for cheap. I wasn't too concerned -- none of the windows in any of the cars appeared smashed or anything. Behind the officers a swarm of vehicles had boxed in another, a boring sedan. The door was ajar and inside I could see another officer setting items on the hood. It was a modest collection. None of my possessions appeared to be in the rather sizeable pile on the vehicle's hood.


He added nervously, ""Except that one."" He motioned to my beat up Saturn. And I say beat up, but really it looked like something out of Mad Max. The hood and quarter panel were painted flat black, while the rest of the car was purple. It was coated in a veneer of rust all over the underside, looking like it had been ridden hard and put up wet. 


My partner raised her voice, ""Hey! Why not my car?!"" Well, I approached to correct her. I would regret this decision shortly. The officer gave a quizzical look at the would-be thief. 


""Yes, why not *that* car?"", the officer says, turning back to the thief. 


At this point, I'd reached the small crowd and announced myself. ""Excuse me, it's actually my car."" I got a polite nod, and the officers continued. I gave a questioning and slightly annoyed towards my partner. The thief, now appearing quite anxious, retorted ""Because of the dead body!"" 


There was a moment of silence as all the officers jerked up and all looked at him, then my car. Then me and my partner, all in rapid succession. They all reflexively put their hands on their sidearm and one of them looked at the two of us and said rather sharply ""Don't move."" Great. So now we've gone from petty theft to body stashing. An officer keyed up his radio to call for backup, ""suspicion of murder, suspects at gunpoint."" Visions of officers opening the trunk to find some gruesome scene flashed through my head. My stomach braced. My partner and I exchanged nervous looks.


Two other officers approached the car and peered into the back seat. At the same time then the guns came out of the holster and the two of them turned their attention to us, yelling, ""Get on the ground!"" Well this day is off to a great start. We've gone from overdue library books to murder. Me and my partner both complied, while other officers opened up my car. I heard some excited noises from them followed by silence, ""Uh chief, you better come see this."" Both of them were grinning and looking back at the thief, who looked pale as a ghost. The plot sickens.


A third, rather larger man sauntered over and then burst out laughing, ""Let them up,"" gesturing towards the officer with his knee in my back. ""Okay, what the actual fuck is going on,"" I wondered to myself. The chief is practically out of breath from choking down laughter and tells his subordinate with the thief to go ahead and put him in the back of a squad car. We both approach nervously and peer into the car.


It was only then I realized what had happened. The thief had been going through the cars and skipped ours because, in the back seat, was a pile of mannequin parts. We'd found them in an alleyway a couple days prior in the esteemed Loring Park area, perhaps the gayest part of the Twin Cities. I'd entirely forgotten about them. We had intended to use them to decorate our new, and rather empty, apartment, and nothing says queer quite like a fashion mannequin holding coats by the door. He must have spotted them and decided they were the chopped up remains of someone. 


Now, we both knew they looked realistic enough because we'd managed to scare the shit out of a former roommate who liked to rummage through our stuff by leaving an arm and some pillows under a blanket to make her think one of us was sleeping there and discourage snooping. But of course, she'd gotten too curious and gotten a dose of karma for her trouble. And now all the officers were taking turns, looking back at us, and grinning ear to ear at us and the idiot thief. In the end, we were left with many apologies and another tale for friends of my fabled car of the damned. A few minutes later a SWAT truck, driven by some bored officers, pulled up and took their turn looking and laughing.


TL;DR - Was nearly given the chair for murdering a mannequin and overdue library books. 


EDIT: Obviously officers don't talk like this. It happened a decade ago. Forgive my attempt at recreating long forgotten conversation. Also, yes, it really was SWAT. No, I can't explain it either. ",tifu
AITA for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?,"I work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

I told them ""you might want to cut that out! Llamas spit in self-defense."" But they kind of laughed my warning off.

Now, I knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. But I decided not to tell them about that. I figured if they persisted, I'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

The llama was being patient. At one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

Finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. It got the girl square in the face. She dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. Her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that I was in.

To make things worse for them, I didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! It was a slow day, so I just locked the doors. I told them I didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

AITA? The girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. Maybe it was...I knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but I wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",AmItheAsshole

It was creepy and weird. I am not at all well endowed, I go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not Karen. Karen urged me to think of her children and Jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. It was so goddamn weird, I felt like laughing in her face, but I didn't want there to be issues so I said I'd be more diligent in the future and Karen went about her business.

Well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for Karen, y'all, oh no. Not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. Karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. While my breasts are small and humble, I am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

The second time Karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. She threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated I got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a Jezebel and that I needed Jesus. Because I was wearing Jean shorts.

We live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and I like to go out for walks, but it seems every time I step foot out of my door, there's fucking Karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. It's getting annoying. 

This is in Florida, by the way.

EDIT: I got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (I do not regularly dress like this) I must have been quite a sight to Karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. She started laying into me. I just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then I said ""you can stop the games, Karen. I see the way you look at me, I know you want me."" Her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""I'll pray for you."" Then scurried away. Actually went inside her house. üòÇ",legaladvice

I found my 30 year old fianc√© talking to 13 and 14 year old children. What is my next step?,"I apologize if this belongs in relationship advice but I am pursuing the legal route instead

I found messages on my fianc√©'s Snapchat account of him talking to two different people sexually and romantically. I took it upon myself to message each girl myself to get more information before I left him. Upon talking to them I discovered that one girl is 14 and one is 13. The 14 year old claims that my fianc√© was willing to drive to her to have sex and that he also sent her explicit photos. I have no proof of these claims and neither does she due to him deleting his account and the profile is no longer able to be searched and messages cannot he retrieved. She also had one of my fianc√©'s best friends added to her Snapchat profile and was able to prove that his friend did send her sexually explicit photos of himself as well. 

We also have a one year old daughter who I am going to protect from him at any cost. What can I do to ensure this?

I have not contacted the police yet. I am not sure if a crime has been actually committed as I'm unfamiliar with the law. I just need help knowing how to get my ducks in a row and what my next step should be.",legaladvice
UPDATE: Is a picnic basket too much on a first date?,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blwo1p/is_a_picnic_basket_too_much_on_a_first_date/

UPDATE: The date went really really well! Nature helped me out a little bit and it was extremely nice out. The drive was about an hour to the falls through a pretty remote part of Oregon and was super scenic. We only saw two other cars. When we got to the falls we were the only people. Chinook Salmon were attempting to leap up the falls so it was definitely a cool thing to watch. The bottle of wine came out early and we consumed the entire thing sitting at the bottom of the falls. I kept our picnic simple and made her a sandwich. I think I did good by bringing whole vegetables, a cutting board and knife and half ass chef'd it up in the woods. We stayed until it almost got dark. 


I did another smart move by having our meeting spot be at this Indian Casino. She said she had never gambled in her life so I brought her in and we had a drink and I gave her 20$ to spend. She found this bee slot machine (my last name has Honey in it, so the bee was appropriate) and ended up winning $150! At that point it was getting pretty late so I walked her to her car gave her a kiss and said goodnight. I am going to see her this weekend again. Definitely STOKED!",relationship_advice
Unnecessary/random sex scenes in movies or shows are annoying.,"I hate whenever I am watching a show or movie and an unnecessary sex scene comes on. Especially if there are multiple sex scenes that aren't needed. Sometimes I'm watching something with a family member and a scene like that comes on and it makes everything so awkward and some of those scenes are so long and dragged out. I just feel like those scenes are being added into shows more often because they think it'll get more viewers (kind of like horror movies who use too many jump scares to try to make things more creepy, but it just becomes annoying)",unpopularopinion

TIFU by using my parents PC.,"TL;DR at the bottom.

NSFW

This is still fresh in my mind as I'm typing. I take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my Dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. Today was just a routine visit. My folks live in the country and don't have trash pickup so I visit with Dad while driving their garbage to the dump. As we are talking I bring up a video I had seen and suggested I share it with him. He agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests I find the video while he does something else. 

Commence Fuckup. 
My Dad has an older model Desktop PC that is quite temperamental and only likes to use Google Chrome. I go to open a window and see that my Dad has 20+ tabs open. All of them were different profiles on FetLife. For those who don't know, FetLife is like MySpace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). I just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. Unfortunately the tab I opened Chrome to was my parents profile page. I not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; I also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. So now, not only do I know my parents are pretty kinky, I also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a Christmas turkey. 

TL;DR:
Opened Google Chrome to share something with my dad, only to find out he gets butt-raunched by my mother on the regular.

EDIT2: WOW my first Gold! Thanks Stranger!!

EDIT 3: My wife is a reddit user and knows her husband posted this from the commute detail. She didn't believe me so she temporarily created a FetLife account so I could, for once, be right. Now she is very distraught and has told me she can never look at my parents the same. What do?",tifu

AITA for pressing charges on my Daughter for Fraud?,"Me and my wife recently found out that her daughter (my step-daughter, though I consider her close enough to my own after having raised her for 18 years) has taken out about $60,000 in loan debt under our name, without our permission. For some basic context, she took out a Parent Plus Loan for school, under our name and social security number, without asking us. In her first semester of her Freshman Year, she did come to us, asking if we would fill out the paperwork for her, since her school's loans were only for about $5000 for the whole year. We explained that we didn't have the financial means to take out a loan for the amount she was requesting; about $14,000 a year, but offered to help her find scholarships or work-study, and other ways to potentially help her cover her costs. After me and her applied for about 5-10 scholarships, and she got a part-time job, she never came back to me and my wife with any financial aid concerns again, so we figured that she had largely figured it up. We brought up tuition a couple times, but every time we'd ask, she'd just say that she was able to cover it all, and didn't need any help with it or anything.

Come us, a couple years down the road. We've gotten a letter from the Department of Education saying that 'our' loan has gone into default, and has been so for about a year at this point. We reach out to her school and, after a little bit of digging, we discover that after we had told her ""no"" on the loan, she had gone around our back and applied for it all online. She filled in her own contact information instead of our own, and the loan went through just fine, since she had the correct Social Security Numbers and all. We've spoken with the school and the DoE a fair amount about this already, and we basically have 2 options for this. We can either eat the loan, and pay it all back ourselves (something not at all financially feasible for my family, since we have about $40k in Medical Debt on top of this now), or to go through the state to press charges on each one of the 5 loans she's taken out; each loan being over $10,000, making this a Felony in my state with a minimum prison sentence. At this point, I'm not certain what my family \*can\* do. We don't have the money to be able to pay this loan back, but me and my wife are emotionally wrecked at even the thought of pressing charges against our own daughter. So, here's the important question, reddit: if I press charges here, AITA?

Edit: Since there's a little bit of confusion, a bit of clarification. A Plus Loan is a loan that we would take out in our own name, to give her extra funds for education. Because we would ordinarily be the ones taking it out, she's not involved with the Repayment Process at all; she's not even technically eligible to make payments towards it, since it's under our own name.  


Edit 2: I promised myself I would never do anything stupid like this if I ever had a post blow up, but now I truly understand what RIP Inbox means. I really truly would like to thank everyone here for their support; I know reddit is one of the few places I can make a post and expect to get a reply.  


In reality, even though I've gotten a huge outpouring of support saying I WNBTA (is that a thing? idk) if me and my wife go through with this, I'm still 100% split about how I actually want to go. You guys have given me a lot to chew on, and I'd really like to thank you all.",AmItheAsshole
I [22F] read my parents' texts and found out my immediate family pretty much despises me.,"I honestly don't even know where to start here... I haven't lived at home for the past four years of undergrad because I function better when I'm not around my family all the time.  I think and function differently from them, which is something I thought was OK and not a source of conflict until this morning.  I'm moving in a month for grad school so I moved back home for the summer to save a bit of money.  The entire summer both my siblings and my parents have been very nasty (mostly in the way of exclusionary and passive aggressive behavior) towards me despite minimal confrontation or conflicts occurring.  It's been really upsetting but I've tried to push it aside.  I've heard them talking about me behind my back on multiple occasions and even seen text messages over my sister's shoulder between her and my mom calling me disgusting and really just trashing me in any way they know how.

I am aware that what I did was wrong / I shouldn't have done it, but my dad went to the grocery store and left his phone at our house.  Everyone else was sleeping and morbid curiosity got the best of me, so I opened it (he doesn't have a passcode) and went through he and my mother's texts together.  I don't know what exactly I was expecting to find, perhaps a few sparing texts about me, I don't know, but I was completely shocked to find that the majority of their conversations are about how much they despise me.  Like this is to the point where they purposely plan family lunches/dinners/movie nights/etc when they *know* I am working or otherwise busy and invite me even though they know I can't go so that it's not obvious they don't want me in attendance.  I'm not even worthy of a name in their conversations, as my dad merely refers to me as ""the bitch"" and my mother follows suit.  My mom says things like ""It's so funny how she acts like her life is so great but she can't be genuinely happy because she is the most miserable bitch I have ever met.""  They say I bring down the mood, I walk into the room and I'm a bitch, etc.

There are also several texts where my dad will message my mom complaining about how annoying I'm being and she will respond saying my sister and brother are also texting her the same thing and they'll laugh about it.  So while I'm in the room with my entire family, they are texting about how insufferable I am.

I think the worst thing of all is that my sister outed me to my entire family.  I came out to her in December after being closeted for years and it was a very huge step for me to do this as my family is not very supportive of the LGBTQ+ community and I was terrified to tell anyone.  I told her I wasn't ready to share this information with anyone and she turned around and told everyone in my family about it.  They are ""sickened"" by my ""lifestyle"" and have no issue with her mistreating me because she disagrees with my ""lifestyle"" (yes, that is what they are calling it).

Growing up I was always straight-laced, kept my head down, and did what I was supposed to.  I am good in school and got involved with community service/volunteering and excelled in varsity sports.  I've also worked since I was fourteen.  I pay for all of my expenses and never ask for a thing from my parents.  In college I had a 4.0 and I got into multiple top PhD programs straight out of undergrad.  I won multiple prestigious awards in undergrad whose ceremonies both my parents never bothered showing up at.  I am the black sheep and they abuse me for it.

I know snooping was wrong and I'm not sure what I expected to find doing something like this but damn, this hurts like hell.  I've always felt generally ostracized and sort of disliked by my family but I tried to tell myself that it was just my anxiety going into overdrive and brushed it off.  But these were not mere hunches, they are true.  I feel sick to my stomach and absolutely numb, and I'm honestly not sure how I should proceed from here.  Should I try to bring things up with my family?  Should I just bide my time for the next few weeks until I move?

TLDR: I knew my family was talking about me behind my back so I read my parents' texts and found horrible messages about me and also found out that my sister outed me to my family.

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** Thank you so much everyone for the outpour of support, kindness, and advice.  I initially really just needed to get this off my chest and find a soundboard in the reddit community but you all have rallied and helped me significantly.  I am trying my best to respond to your numerous comments, messages, and PMs offering support and love but there are a lot to go through so please know I see you and appreciate you very much!

Some people have shared that I've come across as very superior- and pretentious-sounding in the comments.  I want to apologize for that and express that this was not my intention.  I was simply trying to share that I've had multiple achievements that I would like to *share* and *celebrate* with my family, but instead they seem to scorn me for them.  Success should be shared amongst families, not be a divisive factor!

**EDIT 2:** Just going to answer a few of the common questions I'm seeing in the comments here.

* Yes, my family is religious.  They are Catholic.  I am not religious but keep quiet about this and still bow my head in prayer at supper and participate in everything they would like me to.
* No, I do not spew my political beliefs to them or anywhere near them.  In fact, I hardly talk politics.  I do not post my views on social media or engage in political discourse on social media.  When my parents are talking politics, I merely listen respectfully and offer no opposition to what they have to say.  I pick my battles, and politics / religion are not battles I prefer to have.
* Yes, I have friends.  No, my relationships outside my immediate family are not negative.  I generally get along well with others at work, school, and in social environments.
* My relationship with my extended family is positive and healthy.
* No, I am not adopted. 

&#x200B;

**EDIT 3:** Copying and pasting a response to a comment on the thread.  A lot of people are confused about how much my family's mistreatment of me ties into my queerness.  Here's a bit more context that I definitely should have provided earlier:

The issues with my sister started after I came out to her! This is definitely something I should have clarified, I'm sorry. Here's the story:

I was dating this really awesome girl in December who has been out and proud since middle school. I was falling for her and realized that it wasn't fair to her to have to be dating someone in the closet, so I decided it was time to start taking steps towards being out. I figured baby steps were the way to go, so I started with my sister. My sister and I have told each other a lot of private information in the past and I thought I could trust her with this. I was initially hesitant to tell her because she has made ignorant homophobic comments in the past and casually uses slurs such as ""dyke"" and sees no issue with it. However, one of my good friends told me that her family was the same way and when she came out they realized how horrible their behavior had been, felt awful about it, and apologized profusely. So I figured that if my sister knew about me, maybe she would realize the weight of her unkind words. I told her and she was definitely surprised/caught off guard by it and acted a little awkward. But after that nothing happened and no mention was made of it. She began just acting a little stiff and awkward around me which over the course of several months has escalated into resentment and bullying. Now mind you, my parents have been resentful and harsh towards me for the past several years, but my siblings at least usually had my back and I felt like I had some support with them. But once I came out to my sister, things slowly started to change.

In early July, we were at our cousins' house and I was in the bathroom. The house is small with thin walls and I overheard a conversation in which my sister and brother were expressing their disgust towards me because of my sexuality. So I realized at that point that my sister had outed me to my brother and now to my cousin. At this point I realized that she was really betraying my trust and clearly didn't care much for my privacy and well-being, but I still didn't think she would tell my parents, knowing their thoughts and opinions on gay people. Well, she did. I'm not sure when exactly, but in their text messages they were excusing her mistreatment of me because they understand that she does not agree with my ""lifestyle.""

I'm going to paste this comment in a third edit on my main post because a lot of redditors are confused at lacking context. Well, here is some more. This situation is complex and something I am struggling to make sense of myself, so before you make an unkind comment calling me things such as a ""bitch,"" a ""whore,"" and a ""cunt,"" among other slurs, please realize that I am in the dark here as well.",relationship_advice
AITA for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising?,"So my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she's heard good things about. We get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, I'm hungry. 

I look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients I've never heard of. I order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki I think ($18). Very important, these were listed as ENTREES on the menu. Mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

So anyway we order as we are starving. My steak arrives and I am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. I joke to the waiter ""where's the rest of my steak?"" and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. I don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. When I go to restaurants I expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

I'm complaining to my girlfriend and she's getting annoyed with me. Similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. Granted the food was pretty good but I can not get over how tiny these portions are. I'm a big guy and I like to eat, what can I say. 

When the waiter comes back I inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. My girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, I don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

A manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. I don't end up paying as they realized I called them out on their bullshit. My girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. Im still hungry so I drive through McDonald's and get a burger, and when I did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. It's now the next day and I'm starting to think I didn't handle the situation as well as I could have (I could have probably just asked for a discount). My girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now I'm starting to think I'm an asshole.

Am I the asshole?",AmItheAsshole
AITA for being upset that my parents gave my wedding fund to my sister to freeze her eggs?,"I want to preface this by saying that I've been 100% financially independent from my parents since the day I graduated college. I know they don't owe me a dime and I'm grateful for everything they've given me in life. 

I have a sister who is about a decade older than me, and my parents promised each of us a set amount of money towards our weddings. My sister used this money to have a big, beautiful wedding and I'm happy my parents were able to help make her special day like something out of a fairytale. Now it's my turn to get married, but my parents have admitted to me that they gave away the money they had saved for my wedding to my sister. 

My sister, a mother of one, had a series of health problems and had to freeze her eggs if she ever wanted to have another child. She didn't have the money and only had a few weeks before her hysterectomy so she asked my parents for the $13,000, which they obviously gave her. My sister was absolutely devastated by her health issues and scared, and because they're great people, my parents were willing to do anything to make her feel better. 

I know I sound like a selfish, vapid bitch for prioritizing my wedding over her fertility, but she was 36 when she got the diagnosis. There was no telling how long it would take for her health to recover, and it would be years before they could even afford supporting another infant, let alone the tens of thousands a surrogate would cost. I knew she would never have the means to use those eggs before she was 40, and she has made it very clear that she wouldn't want to have an infant at that age. In my opinion, she acted in panic and wanted a safety net that she knew she would never use. I don't blame her for being scared. I would have been terrified to. 

But I'm still upset that now I won't be able to have much of a wedding because I had been counting on the funds my parents had promised. I'm not so much upset that they gave it to her, but I am upset that they gave it to her *knowing* nothing would ever come of it. That they traded my wedding day for her brief peace of mind. My sister has confirmed already that she and her husband will not be having another child. 

When my parents told me there was no money, they were obviously stricken and apologetic. I couldn't hide my disappointment. I really tried to reassure them that I understood, but they could tell I was hurt. My sister called later and told me that it sucks I can't have a 'fancy wedding' (like hers) but basically I need to grow up. Which seemed hypocritical, since she made such a big deal out of her wedding needing to be extravagant. She said she's sorry, but at the time her future children were more important than one day in my life not being as nice as I'd hoped. 

I know this isn't the end of the world. This is dumb and petty in the grand scheme of things and I feel ridiculously shallow for being so upset over losing my dream wedding. I'm still getting married. My wedding won't compare to my sister's, but I'm still marrying the love of my life and it will still be an awesome day. 

Thanks for sticking with me through the story. I know plenty of you are rolling your eyes over the dramatic bullshit that comes with weddings. So, am I overreacting? AITA?

My (21M) friend (21F) is being forced to marry a 43 year-old man.,"Me and my friend are both from India. We recently graduated from our college and were planning to get a good job. She is from a very underdeveloped village and was given scholarship by the government to study. Her parents are socially backward and never contributed for her well being and were against of her education from start. Her mom is abusive and her father is an alcoholic. She is the only one in her family to graduate. Her sister dropped out of the school and works as a part time maidservant. The one who supported her through tough times is her aunt. Her aunt fought with her parents and supported her through graduation, but she later passed away last december. Now that her aunt is out of the way her parents are trying to claim her as their own. Her parents are forcing her to marry a 43 year-old for their personal gain. Basically this man is ready to offer her parents three lakhs rupees ( roughly 4354 USD) in exchange of their daughter. The man in question is very shady. He has many lawsuits filed over him and is potentially connected with the local gang members. He is avoiding his jail time because of his political connections and power. He is already married to two women 41F and 32F and has four children, eldest being a 19 year old boy.

My friend do not know what to do. She cried yesterday while being with our other friends. We are motivating her to move away from her parents and start her own life. But she is too scared to take any actions.

If the marriage continues and they both get married, her life will get ruined. She will get abused more and will be forced to work in kitchen for rest of her life.

AITA for not letting my kids go on vacation with my ex because it's my time with them.,"So right now both of my kids (16 year old son and 9 year old daughter) and my ex are extremely mad at me because I won't give up my appointed time with them. My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. 

&#x200B;

A little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't ""switch"" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. 

&#x200B;

Well, last week my ex contacted me and told me the ""good"" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to ""think of them"". I told him ""tough luck"" and hung up on him.

&#x200B;

Well, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying ""ask them"" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was ""not letting daddy take them to Disneyland"". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.

&#x200B;

I'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being ""can't tell them the truth cause they already know it"". 

&#x200B;

I'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? ",AmItheAsshole

Ex fails drug test giving birth to her baby and now DSS wants to do a home visit with me.,"So the backstory goes like this: 

Ex and I had a son together. She decided one day to split and go live the party life. I take our son and move on and meet and marry my now wife. Wife and I buy a house and have a new baby ourselves. Ex meets someone and they become meth heads together. At that point I sought custody of our son and won. Our custody arrangement states that I have primary care and she is to only see him every other weekend supervised at/by her parents. Which for a long time she rarely, if at all showed up. Ex and new boyfriend have extremely volatile and abusive relationship, she gets pregnant and new boyfriend leaves. Ex appears to have gotten it together enough now that she's pregnant. Or so it appeared.

On to the issue. 

Ex gives birth to new baby. I get a phone call THAT DAY from dss saying that they'd like to come do a home visit to check on my son because she failed a drug test (for marijuana) when she gave birth. This was not the first instance during the pregnancy that dss was involved. From my understanding, she failed for the same reason early in the pregnancy so I guess dss kept her on their radar. So dss calls me explains what's happening and even asks if I'd be willing to do a drug test as well.

I have and want as little as possible to do with my ex. As I stated, i moved on and feel I'm doing well for me and my family. She is the unfortunate consequence for my young naivety. I do not regret having my son I just wish she wasn't his mother. 

So because of her actions and choices, I'm being dragged in by proxy. 

My job is very laborious and in the interest of full transparency, I myself (responsibly) smoke weed at night before bed. 

So what are my options as far as what dss is asking of me? Do I consent to everything? Do I seek legal representation? What happens if I take the drug test and fail? Will I lose my kids? 

This is really the most stressful situation for me and my wife who have nothing to do with her and her problems except the fact she's my sons mother

AITA For Firing An Employee After His Parents Died?,"I'm the VP of Sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of April, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. Now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. He's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. His job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. Because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. He's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. Our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

We called him into a meeting on Friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. Told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. I thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

I told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

"My immigrant, deaf father was choked, body-slammed, arrested and had his sentry card taken away at the border for failing to comply to an audible demand. I want a copy of the video and his sentry card back.","EDIT:
The title of this post inaccurately states my father was body-slammed. After a carefully talking to the family members present I realized this was not the case. The rest of this post remains unchanged.

A little background: 

My entire family and I are naturalized citizens from Mexico. We were all born and raised in Mexico and we tend to visit a lot of family and friends on an almost daily matter. We live in San Diego and in order to avoid hours of waiting at the border, we applied for and received [Sentry cards](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri/how-apply-sentri). We are hard-working people, engineers, educators, pay our taxes, etc...

My father was crossing back across the border into the US in one of the sentry lanes during labor day at around 7 PM. My father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, and my pregnant sister-in-law and my niece were in the back of the car. According to the accounts of my family, there were two border patrol officers on the passenger side checking sentry cards before the actual booth. One of the officers made a hand signal in the shape of a license, implying that my dad flash the sentry cards, which he did - but the officer did not see it. The officer starts walking in front of the vehicle towards the driver side door while making the same motion and yelling something out which my father does not make out (he is deaf). He starts banging on the drivers side door. My father once again flashes the sentry cards and says ""Here it is!"". 

My family says that the officer did not like the tone my father was using and said ""OK. I'm gonna get your sentry card taken away"". My father opens the car door, confused and interpreting the banging on it as the officer asking to open it up. The officer then proceeds to choke my dad, drag him out of the car and handcuff him. My mother tried to explain that my father was deaf and wasn't understanding what the officer wanted. He replied with ""I don't care"".

Afterwards, my father was taken to a processing facility and released without any charges - except the officer was successful in taking his sentry card.

For obvious reasons this angers me - it really complicates our way of life here in a border city. I'd like to recover my dads sentry card.

I also would like to acquire video of the situation if possible. Border crossings are high-security environments and I know there must be video of the incident in possession by the BP officers. How would I go about getting video of the incident?",legaladvice
My(23F) boyfriend(25F) left me on the side of the road and I deserved it.,"My amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. He was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. After we were done we left, and we were about half way home when I asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. He said something like ""Haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. My stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""C'mon, please? I want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. After that I kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than I deserve, he's firm and says no. I give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. Apparently I pulled harder than I thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. To make things worse, he just bought this car. The driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). They didn't even exchange any information. While he's being yelled at, I don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something I did. When he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. His entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. To try and break the tension a little, I say ""Well, that could've gone a lot worse."" As soon as I say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. I've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment I did. He looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. I got out and he sped off. It was starting to get dark and I was in a stretch of woods. It took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when I got there him and all his stuff was gone.

I feel so horrible. I cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. We've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now I don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. I've been getting texts like ""Wtf"" and ""What the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so I think he's told them what happened. 

It seems like everybody's mad at me. Is there any way to fix this? How can I apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?",relationship_advice

Women who are making fun of men for being offended by the Gillette ad are being extremely hypocritical and it drives me mad.,"Whether you agree with it or not, some men have taken offense to the things said and the ideas being pushed by the recent Gillette advertisement. With these feelings being brought to light on social media I've started to see many different instances of women criticizing the feelings of these men stating that ""they should only be offended if they are the toxic male audience that Gillette is criticizing"" and it drives me mad. Why can every other group of people feel offended but when straight males are targeted and feel as if they are being unfairly portrayed it is socially acceptable to mock these claims for internet clout? Why can't men feeling offended by something be considered legitimate?

Now I know that Gillette's intent with the ad was made with good intent however I feel as if the delivery was a bit heavy handed and feel that they deserve the criticism. Sorry for the rant.

[Update] My(27F) son(6) doesn't like my boyfriend (31M). Everyone thinks I should break up with him but I don't want to. What do I do?,"[Original post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cohppg/my27f_son6_doesnt_like_my_boyfriend_31m_everyone/)

Turns out it really was something his grandparents said as many of you suggested. They said some things that made my son think that my boyfriend and I will make our own family and he'll be the fifth wheel and I will no longer love him. I reassured him and made sure he understood I will always love him and that he will only have more people love him, not less. Boyfriend and I agreed we needed to spend more time together with him and we've been doing that and he's warmed up to bf surprisingly quickly. So that's working out really well and my boyfriend has been really wonderful throughout this, I feel kind of ashamed for even considering breaking up with him. I've been told ""I told you so"" by my brother..

I have been putting off talking to his grandparents. But I will definitely talk to them before I let my son spend time with them again. I want to make it clear to them that it's not acceptable to say or insinuate things like that to my son but also want to reassure them that they will get to see him (so long as they don't put weird ideas in his head). I think I will see them by myself and lay it all out and then maybe have a little break before letting my son visit them...?

Edit: thank you all for your kind words and advice. Honestly overwhelmed by the amount of responses. Wasn't expecting it. I know many of you think that I should cut his grandparents off but I honestly don't think they must've said something like that directly to him. Maybe he misunderstood. I will find out for sure when I speak to them. I am taking this very seriously and it's definitely a possibility depending on how everything goes.",relationship_advice

My son,11, has been acting up in school. Not doing his homework, talking during lessons, picking on other kids, getting write-ups,detentions, and just being a little brat. 

At home he's disrespectful as well, picking on his siblings, talking back etc. Every  other year our family takes a really big vacation. 

This year we are going to California for 3 weeks. He's never been and REALLY- REALLY wants to go. 

I've told him all year if he doesn't behave he won't go to California. When I remind him he behaves for a few days or so then goes back to being bratty. 

His teacher said that even if he passes all of his next test and homework he will only have a 2.3 at most(she even gave him extra credit assignments). We agreed on a 3.0 or higher for California. 

I told my son that he won't be able to go to California, he laughed and said ""yea right"".

I'm currently planning my mother's funeral on behalf of my siblings (they live overseas and are not here yet). My mother and father were divorced but were on good terms. In particular, my mother was close friends with my father's new wife.

This women - my father's current wife - has an ongoing dispute with my wife. They have a long long history of bad blood between each other. Both of them have said extremely hurtful things to one another. Obviously I think my wife is less of an asshole between the two, but both are definitely wrong for saying the things they have.

Anyway even though I really dislike this women, I have to invite her to my mother's funeral service because: 1. She's my father's wife and 2. She was close friends with my mom. My wife was livid at finding out about this and insists I put my foot down and not let her attend the service.

So for two long days she constantly nags me about this bringing it up every hour. I keep telling her the same thing about why she needs to come. I try to compromise by saying if my wife is so uncomfortable she doesn't need to attend, and I wont hold it against her. She refuses this as she wants to be there to support me.

So a few hours ago she brings the topic up yet again and I lose my tempter. I tell her (paraphrasing)

""Just shut up already. You don't get a day in this. You don't get to dictate my mother's funeral for Christs sake. Just leave me alone already.""

I did not say it calmly. I yelled it and was definitely angry because I'm busy organising my mother's funeral. She has gone off crying and I'm left wondering if I went too far.

I have both good news and bad news.

The good news is that I won the battle with my ex. I put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. I had documents about me showing I don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (I don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before I married her. However paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. That ended the case. It took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but I won. I don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. Maybe she thought that I won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

The bad news is that, I'm dying. As I mentioned in the comments of my original post, I was battling cancer at the time that I made the post. It was the fourth time in my life that I was dealing with cancer and even though I had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and I have very little chance of beating it again. I will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. I'm happy with the life I've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until I finally rest for good.

AITA for not wanting to be involved with a child I helped conceive?,"I got pregnant in high school, when I was 17 (I am just turning 30 now). I wanted an abortion and my boyfriend begged, begged, begged, guilted, begged me to carry the fetus to term and that he would raise the baby himself. He involved his parents, who involved my parents, and since my parents were against abortion, they agreed on my behalf that this is what would happen.

I was naive at the time about how horrible pregnancy and delivery would be with a baby you don't want. I was miserable, in pain, anxious, isolated, and sick the whole time. Delivery was a nightmare. The whole process was so traumatic that I've been diagnosed with PTSD from it, for which I've been in therapy for the last four years.

In my country, if both parents are 18 and both agree to it, one parent can legally give up parental obligations, so I did that. I haven't regretted it for a minute (I do regret not getting an abortion because of the trauma it caused me, I do NOT regret giving up parental rights). I do not think about this child, I do not think of myself as having a child, I am not a mother. I have never met the child and never want to.

Last month, my exboyfriend contacted me (again through my parents) because he and his wife have split up and now that his daughter is 12, she wants to know about the circumstances of her birth. I told him that we did things according to his wishes and I never, ever want contact with his child and don't want him to tell her my name or contact information.

He and my parents are furious and my parents also admitted they thought I'd 'come around.' They want to be in his child's life but want me to also be a part of it. I won't. Am I the asshole here? All I have done is what I have always said I would do.

Note: Sorry, English isn't my first language. I also tried to talk this out on another forum and it turned into a very US-centric conversation about abortion and child support but none of that applies as I am not from US and we do not have the same type of child support laws.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by unwrapping a condom,"So this happened earlier in the week but is NSFW so posting on the weekend. Also on my throwaway acc. since I don't want this story going back to the IRL me.

So at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our ""welcome to uni"" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. I'd always chucked these in my drawer for ""future use"" if the situation requiring them ever arose. It never has and so I took them home over summer and they've been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.

Anyway, I'm on intersemester break right now so I (19M) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. I decided I'd open the wrapper since I'd never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and I thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.

As I discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason I took a smell since I could kind of tell it smelt weird.

When I did this, I realised that I had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. I have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when I was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. Except now I realise it *wasn't* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. I felt pretty sick then.

I wish I could delete memories and that I'd never remembered/realised this.

TL;DR  got out a condom to try it out, realised I've tasted condoms before.

&#x200B;

Edit: A lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. I have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it's definitely not catholic. I think it's something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.

I think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that ""pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc."" I'm also from New Zealand, not North America as a few have assumed. Here it's taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me ""the talk"" either.

The ""balloon"" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.

"TIFU by kicking a chestnut, stopping traffic for an hour and getting cornered by a lynch mob","So obligatory this happened yesterday but I'm still traumatised as I've never really encountered confrontation on such a big scale.

So let me set the scene first. I live (and grew up) in a fairly densely populated city in Europe that has a good amount of nature patches. The people are genuinely quite friendly and usually not too short-tempered unless strangers (a.k.a non-locals) are involved. The location of this FU was a pretty busy junction just down the road of my flat - think two car lanes, cycling lanes, and pedestrian crossing. Anyway, it was just before rush hour, around 4 pm and the sun was grilling everyone in Europe (climate change - yeiy) for the past 3 weeks.

I was strolling down the road towards the junction completely blanking my surrounding as I was trying to come up with the perfect dish to surprise my gf in the evening. Picture that quiet guy just minding his own business, head down, focusing on every single step - yep that's me. Suddenly, I bump my head into a rock - or so I initially thought. I look up. It was the largest man I've ever seen - about the size of the mountain from GOT. He looked like a bodybuilder on steroids with a side of extra muscle (let's call him ARNIE). I was startled for a second before I see his buddy (let's call him SLY) who was quite a bit shorter but just as wide as he was tall - so still quite intimidating for an under-the-radar-guy like me. ""Oi, watch where you are going"" I bellow (jk, obviously Arnie did). So being super alpha and dominant I mumble ""Sorry"" and move around them to continue my walk to the supermarket. ""I mean how the f\*\*\* was I meant to walk past them when they literally block the whole pavement standing next to each other."" I think and kick a chestnut out of frustration - metaphorically releasing and passing on all my problems. And oh boy that worked - somewhat. What happened next I could not have imagined in a thousand lifetimes. Hey, I mean even with the current AI technology I doubt they would have been able to predict that outcome.

I see the chestnut flying Roberto Carlos style towards the junction (hell, I heard the crowd roaring) and IMO it probably even broke the sound barrier. While the chestnut was still in flight I raise my hand in pride having reclaimed my manliness with this superb treasure of a shot. And I'm talking the eager-please-pick-me-keen-bean-Susan from middle-school hand raise (no, Susan mayonnaise is not an instrument).

Suddenly everything kept coming down.

The chestnut flew past a motorcyclist (around 3 feet high) who must have registered some kind of movement in front of him and he immediately hit the break. Remember how I said they had nature patches in the city? Well, the city installed sprinklers to keep the grass hydrated and green, but they somehow have their own spirit and love releasing water into the most inconvenient directions.

You guessed it, despite almost 40¬∞C there was a puddle the size of a small American town right there in front of the breaking motorcyclist. His breaking turns into sliding, into rotating, into falling and finally into that metal-to-asphalt-screeching halting. Behind him, a red car doesn't manage to break in time but does a Fast and the Furious drift and slides past the motorcycle also coming to a halt in the middle of the crossing around 5 meters away from the motorcyclist. Then my attention is caught by the opposing lane as the red car just cut off a blue car's path who does the same drift (thanks to the puddle) and ends up head-on with the bumper wrapped around the traffic light post. By a miracle of God (or chance for the atheists) the post was harder than a dick after a two-week dry period and withstood the incident without giving in. Yet the ten or so pedestrians waiting behind it scattered away with two stumbling over each other and falling flat faced. What followed after this was the loudest concert of honking cars and screaming, followed by screeching breaks from all directions.

And then a split second of silence.

Until I hear a majestic roaring that Simba would be proud of: ""DUUUUUUUDE, WHAT THE FUCK!!!"", yup Arnie and Sly walk up behind me and instantly get the attention of about another ten surrounding pedestrians that just at that moment exited the supermarket next to me. They start to explain what they saw to the others ('me causing this accident on purpose and celebrating') and suddenly an elderly man (let's call him Miyagi) grabbed my wrist with the iron grip of a Cyberman.

At that moment my life flashed in front of my eyes. My future, my spotless criminal record, my clumsy soap handling skills and my virgin butt hole. I was not going to make it a single night in prison.

Suddenly the commotion starts - picture a Real Madrid vs Barcelona team vs. team fight - all traffic stops, everyone gets out of their cars and comes towards our little ensemble - shouting. I've never seen a crowd agree that fast on anything but within 30 seconds everyone was pointing at me with red faces, anger in their eyes and most of them looked like they were going to release their Super Saiyan form on me while I was still trying to flee Miyagi's claws (I know, statistically not all of them could have been Super Saiyans but still). What I haven't mentioned yet is that I actually look fairly mixed-race and live in a very white neighbourhood - so within another 30 seconds many of the screams were more racist than incident related (immigration and progressive Europe - yeiy). Throughout I just kept silent and head down as about thirty people by now were surrounding me (still triangled by Arnie, Sly, and Miyagi) so that my voice would have drowned anyway.

After about another 5 minutes which felt like an eternity the golden opportunity arrived. I think Sly took some pity with me and signaled a countdown with his left hand so only I could see and pointed into his direction. I am no fighter but I took one class of Wing Chun back in high school and in a spark of genius it all came back to me that moment. 'trap the dragon's head, the tail bites - trap the tail, the head bites'. As Sly got down to his last finger I do the Kung Fu twist with my arm, break Miyagi's iron grip around my wrist and start dashing towards Sly. For a split second I thought I'd run into a muscle wall for the second time this day but in the last moment, he moved his 300 lbs. out of a way with the swiftness of a ballerina (damn, I was impressed). And then the sprint of a lifetime started. I was Powell, Bolt, and Blake at the same time. I ran like my butthole depended on it (well it kinda did). Luckily the mob never bothered to stand behind Arnie and Sly cause they figured I'd never get past them, so I didn't actually have to tackle anyone on my escape (no potential assault charges - yeiy) and continued down the road. I see some people follow me (pretty sure they had no clue about the chestnut but they just thought I was somehow involved) so I kept running and I had a good 100 m head start. I was just in front of my apartment block when I had the second spark of genius of the day - there was no way I would show them where I lived, so I ran for another 10 min further than any man has run ever before (about 2 km) until I reached a park to lie down. I was pretty sure that I lost most people when I passed my flat (thank god for the heat) but I had to be sure.

I cool down and call my neighbour who's flat looks down on the junction. I told her the whole story (she's a super old family friend) and she couldn't believe I was the guy sprinting away (she was sunning on her terrace). Turns out the motorcyclist got up without injury and the blue and red car drivers weren't harmed either. According to my neighbour the cops and ambulance were called and they took down the details of all drivers, moved the blue car and treated the two pedestrians for about an hour, while all traffic was stopped.

Something I didn't realise from my POV was that a second mob formed simultaneously around the motorcyclist after the crash who blamed him for everything, cause it looked like he just couldn't drive‚Ä¶ and guess what - he was a foreigner - so that box was checked. His insurance will probably cover everything (at least that's what my conscience tells me).

I haven't left my flat of fear being recognised at the supermarket, my gf was a bit pissed that I made frozen pizza, and I promised myself to never kick a chestnut again.

tl:dr kicked a chestnut, distracted a motorcyclist, got out of hand and caused a crash, got blamed by a lot of clueless people, escaped running

"My boyfriend ""slut shames"" me because of my post partum body","Some background: I used to be very small chested and thin. I also used to wear a lot of dresses and he loved this. Last August we had our son, so my body still looked like I was 5 months pregnant until about September when it was sweater weather, so I missed out on my wearing any of the dresses I really liked and he never saw my ""new body"".

Since being pregnant, my chest went from a size B to a DD. My body is just generally fuller and I've been feeling self conscious about it for awhile, but he has been encouraging until now. 

On Mother's Day he bought me a really pretty floral dress. The chest area has a dip that is not over the top, but it does show the tops of my newly bigger boobs. I tried it on and he immediately acted off and told me it would just be an ""around the house"" dress. He has never shamed me before so I figured he thought I didn't like it, so we met up for lunch later and I wore it to show him I did. He blew up telling me how provocative I looked and that I was trying to look ""sexy"" in all the photos with our son and how disgusted he would feel when he looked back at them.
We walked back home and he continued this, every time I walked past a guy he would tell me they must be thinking about how easy I was. He told me that we were going to have to go through my closet and throw away any dresses that make me look like a prostitute. 

I got upset with him and told him I was not dressing to look like a whore and that he needed to accept my body wasn't going to look the same as before, and I couldn't just tuck my boobs away especially in summer heat. He got annoyed and asked if I was actually getting mad over it and we didn't talk for a few hours.

His apology was, ""I'm not saying this to make you feel bad, but, C'MON.""

I don't know what to do as he has NEVER been like this before. I feel so ashamed and humiliated and I'm trying to pretend I am not embarrassed but he has really hurt me but can't see it.

UPDATE: My [20] fiance's [27m] behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship,"I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as I felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. A lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

I spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who I am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. She expressed some concern and agreed that I should speak with fiance's brother. Fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. That Sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because I went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because I didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. I got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because I was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. I just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. I knew that something really needed to change.

The next day fiance left for work and I left for school just as usual. I called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and I basically told him that I had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that I was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. Fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. Then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if I wanted to speak with him. I was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. I hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. I was extremely nervous and felt like I was doing something sneaky and horrible, but I needed to know what was going on. I spoke with his manager and learned that he had QUIT his job weeks ago!! He told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. WTF! So I guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. After work I went home and fiance was gaming. I told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. He finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. I was literally shaking at this point and told him that I was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. I said that I was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. I said that I was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. At this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. So I did something stupid and stood in front of the TV and said that I knew about him quitting his job to game all day. He FLIPPED OUT. He got violent and pushed me away from the TV. There was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). I got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. He eventually came and apologized. He offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. I literally felt sick. I locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. He literally just kept gaming until I went to sleep.

The next day I couldn't go to school because I had a bad black eye, it was not something I could explain away. I wanted to just disappear. I got on the bus and went to the women's center. My cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad I looked. I was very adament that I don't want to press charges or anything, I just needed help with the next steps of getting away. The social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. She helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while I drafted and sent fiance a text stating that I cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. He called me nearly 20 times during the time I was at the center. I didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. For the short term I am staying with my cousin and her husband and I'm working on finding an apartment. Next month I'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. I still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like I'm living in a nightmare. But for the past week or so I haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. I've also gone to bed before 11 every night. Someone on here sent me a PM saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so I'm just glad I was able to get away when I did. 

I don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and I just wanted to put this out here.",relationship_advice

I manage a 24/7 motel and only make $600 a month.,"There really isn't a lot to explain on this one, I just have a feeling that I am being illegally exploited by my employers and I'm looking for some advice.

The facts:
- I work in hospitality in Idaho
- I am either engaged in work-related activities or am on call for 24 hours out of the day, 7 days a week 
- I live on site where I work
- I am not allowed to leave for more than an hour (only during a specific time of day as well)
- I haven't received a day off since I started working here three months ago (I have been offered a fill-in to cover for a few hours, but work resumes as soon as I get back home, and I have to find a fill-in myself in a small town of 500 people.)
- I have not provided my employer with my social security number, but they're withdrawing taxes
- I never filled out a W-4, and never recieved an employment contract
- I was told I was salaried but on my paystub it's blank where hours should be and my wage reads $8.00/hr
- I do not have a set payday and my checks have always been 1-4 days late, yet always show a previous (on-time) date when I receive them that aligns with a normal bi-weekly schedule
- I know that my employer is currently undergoing an audit and have been red flagged in the past
- They have a security camera in the office adjoining my apartment with audio equipped that can clearly record my conversations in my living room, and the only separation is a non-locking sliding door that's really more of a privacy curtain than anything, and blocks out no noise
- I have no defined sleeping hours, and more often than not get woken up in the middle of the night to attend to my duties
- There are no labor laws posted anywhere in my work area or common areas. I haven't seen one since I started working here

I know this might be a lot of information, but I just want to make sure that I have a case before I waste my time or money seeing as I don't have much time to investigate or get out of the office.

I posted it in r/izlam, and someone commented ""Yeah, in germany we have bad memories about burning books, but we were mostly nazis back then burning anything that is against fascist doctrine"" maybe the reactions were because I live in a primarily jewish town, or because christians are unaware of how holy scriptures are to be recycled.

[WI] My employer wants me to wear a wig,"Can my employer require me to wear a wig?

I'm a woman with thinning hair. HR says my hair is ""unprofessional"", and wearing a hat or head cover was also rejected (""It's not normal to wear headwear indoors""). I work a desk job in an office environment and direct customer interaction is very rare. I have a number of bald/thinning male co-workers.

Is this gender discrimination? It seems that gender-based hair requirements are legal, so maybe not.

My thinning hair started during pregnancy, but I'm not currently pregnant. I don't have any other medical issues.

Wigs are expensive and uncomfortable, and my employer is not willing to reimburse me for the cost of a wig. They are expecting me to purchase a wig that is comparable in appearance to natural hair ($$$).

How hard can I push back? I can't lose this job, but I don't want to wear a wig every day for the indefinite future. I've been given two weeks to acquire a wig for daily wear.

"I told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.","I got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. I didn't tell him all the details, but I told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and I showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. At first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because I told him I'd run away and call the police if he did.

He called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. Apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. They talked to us away from eachother and I had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who I told everything real specific. She was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

We went back home with them and I showed the police where my mother kept drugs that I'm pretty sure we're illegal. She wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. Then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and I don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs I think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. I think they're gonna look into it though. 

There were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. Like a shelter or something. 

I should of done this year's ago, I feel really bad because I could have had my siblings taken better care of.

TIFU by putting a 5 hour energy in my vagina,"12 hours before my first ""grown up job"" interview, I was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company's grounds. Considering I smoke weed daily I started looking up ways to pass a drug test. I came to the conclusion that I was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. I had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they're just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. 

Unfortunately I was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time I had to prepare, but knowing that I wouldn't be able to pass if the temperature wasn't correct I had the idea to stick it up my vagina. I tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so I could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.

Fast forward to the interview.
It was an hour and a half away so I decided to wait till I got there to insert it. I did it in my car w some coconut oil before I walked in just Incase they decided to drug test me first. I walked in and everything was fine, I signed in and they told me to take a seat. As soon as I sat down I knew something was wrong. I went to the bathroom to make sure I could still take it out. I began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn't move. I tugged again and the string broke. At this point I'm freaking out. I try getting it out with my fingers but I can't reach it. The only ""tools"" I have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. So in a 3 piece suit and heels, I squat and begin to use these ""tools"" to try and remove the bottle. About 4 min go by and I'm really freaking out but need to go back Incase they called my name. I walk out and the HR rep sees me and asks if I'm okay. I tell her I have a tampon stuck up my vagina that I can't get out and that's why I'm freaking out. She then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! Not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, I ask her if I can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. Obviously that didn't work. So she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... Still didn't work. At this point I just have to do the interview. It lasted 3 hours and I had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. 

When the interview finally ends I rush to the closest urgent care where I have to explain to the doctors why there's a 5 hour energy in my vagina. At this point I'm convinced I just don't have the right tools and they'll get it out in no time. Upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it's also sideways. Her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle IN MY VAGINA and then fish it out. ~Luckily~ they just sent me to the ER instead. 

So now I'm at the ER where they then inform me that since it's behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since I wasn't actually giving birth my body wasn't dilated and they couldn't remove the bottle without putting me under.  

Well, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.

Two rednecks flew to Canada on a hunting trip.,"  

 They chartered a small plane to take them into the Rockies for a week hunting moose.   
 

They managed to bag 6. As they were loading the plane to return, the Pilot said the plane could take only 4 moose.   
 

The two guys objected strongly. ""Last year we shot six. The pilot let us take them all and he had the same plane as yours.""   
 

Reluctantly, the pilot gave in and all six were loaded. The plane took  off. However, while attempting to cross some mountains, even on full power, the little plane couldn't handle the load and went down.   
 

Somehow, surrounded by the moose bodies, only the two rednecks survived the   
 crash.   
 

After climbing out of the wreckage, Billy Ray asked Billy Bob, ""Any idea where we   
 are?""   
 

Billy Bob replied, ""I think we're pretty close to where we crashed last year.""",Jokes

"I'm Indian. Apu is not even a little bit offensive. On the contrary, he's one of the best POC representations for its era.","The Simpsons debuted in 1989, when the population was way more white, and the only really existent minority was black (and maybe Hispanic).  Indians basically didn't exist in the US.  

Typically when making roles based on uninfluential minorities, it's considered okay to make them very negative.  This is why Asian characters were shitty roles, while Black characters weren't; Blacks made up 12% of the population, while Asians were not even 1%.  White characters were never made fun of for their whiteness, because whites were 80%+ of the populace.  

Taking this into context, it's actually commendable how great of a character Apu was written to be.  

Now the bad part:  His accent was *absolute white trash levels of horrible*, and makes me cringe listening to it.  I definitely agree that he should have been voiced by someone who could actually do a fucking Indian accent.  But again, given the time this was created in, even this isn't that big of an issue.  

I don't care who the voice actor is, because voice actors routinely voice all sorts of different races.  I've seen lots of Black voice actors voicing whites, it's not a big deal.  I'd only care that they could actually get the accent to be sort of accurate.  That would *probably* necessitate the actor being Indian though.  

For comparison, let's look at Raj, from the Big Bang Theory, which aired in 2007.  BBT pushes all sorts of stereotypes that don't even fucking make sense to me, like effeminacy and obliviousness, and these are *bad* stereotypes to boot.  And that's something that was created just 10 years ago.  Not to mention that BBT is a completely shit show aside from all of that.  

My final take:  People crying about Apu are crybabies who don't know how to think for themselves, and I don't think it's a coincidence that most of the Indian people I know aren't even fazed by him.  I will agree that his accent was trash and grossly inaccurate, and his voice actor should have been replaced a long time ago.  Apart from that, the character himself was totally fine.

The whole ""SJWs are insane"" narrative is largely overblown by fanatic right wing redditors, but even a broken clock is right twice a day, and this is one of those times.  ",unpopularopinion
TIFU by having my reddit history revealed by Jimmy Kimmel live on TV,"This happened to me yesterday and I'm still baffled.

It all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn't stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. 

However it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.

When I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.

They proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

Keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

I don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. On the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!

tl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

TIFU and my son ended up thinking Santa Clause was stealing penises.,"So my wife comes home after picking our two youngest kids up from school. She opens the door and goes, ""Did you say something about Santa Clause stealing penises?""

I reply, ""I didn't say any shit like that. I would NEVER ruin Christmas.""

Here's how we got there:

I have two daughters and a son. My son was 3 or 4 at the time. He refused to wear clothes and ran around naked or in his underwear. My daughters weren't having any of it and were like, ""This is your department, old man. Do something.""

I tried to reason with my son and that just didn't work. I was thinking that I needed something to use that he was afraid to lose. He's a tiny kid. He'll play with a cardboard box and be happy. 

That's when he came running past me with both hands on his junk. That's it. He loves his dick. I love MY dick. Me and my penis are tight. 

So my son and youngest daughter are eating lunch. I look across the table and go, ""Hey big guy, you know how sometimes you can't go to sleep cause you think there's something in your closet?""

Hesitantly, ""... yes.""

""I didn't want to scare you but you're old enough to know now.""

His eyes got wide and my daughter had a puzzled look on her face. She's 4 years older. 

I go, ""There's a goblin that lives in your closet. And if you don't do what you're supposed to, like wear underwear and clothes, he creeps out at night while you're asleep and steals your penis.""

He incredulously responds, ""NAH AH.""

I reassure, ""Oh yeah. What do you think happened to your mom and sisters?""

At this point my youngest daughter loses her mind laughing. She's holding her sides and almost falls out of her seat. 

My son was dead silent. I could almost hear him thinking, ""Damn... they don't have dicks.""

So where does Santa Clause come in?

After I told my wife I would never ruin Christmas, she tells me she heard our son say to our daughter, ""You must have done something really bad for Santa Clause to steal you penis.""

My guy confused Goblins with Santa somehow and thought Santa Clause was roaming around with a big red sack full of stolen dicks. 

Fear not. I straightened him out. I googled pics of Santa and pics of goblins from the movie Labyrinth. 

TLDR: Tried to scare my son into wearing under wear and he ended up thinking Santa Clause was stealing dicks.

AITA for not disciplining my daughter for laying into a nosy woman at church?,"My wife and I have one 14 yo adopted daughter, Sarah, which is relevant to the story. We recently found out that she has PCOS, which I'd never heard of before. Part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. The surgery is scheduled and happening soon. Right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

Between this illness and life in general, Sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. Today at church, some woman decided that Sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her CHANCE at a free baby. Sarah went off on her, calling her a ""barren bitch"", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. 

My wife thinks that Sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. I don't agree.

First off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if Sarah WAS pregnant? Infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. I recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever. With her medical problems, Sarah will probably be infertile herself, which I think puts her on par on that point. Secondly, Sarah lashed out in a rage due to mental and physical pain while provoked by an outrageous encounter. I don't know that that's the same as having ""anger issues"" or a personality problem. I've had physical fights over less. Maybe that nosy woman needed to learn a lesson, and did.

AITA for letting our daughter get off scot free?

TIFU and almost died in the most hilarious way possible,"Not today as per usual. But 18 years ago.

I had moved to California a few years earlier. A few blocks away was a grocery store. In that store was a toy section. Back then. 1998? It just had an assortment of coloring books and some ""squeaky"" toys. Rubber animals you would squeeze to make a noise. I would grab the ""squeak"" thing from those toys. They are the size of a pill or vitamin. If I placed it in my mouth and pulled it to the back I could talk while making a stupid noise. One time heading back to my friends after grabbing a fresh squeaker I accidentally chortle\ snorted and inhaled the thing. I'm behind the store now ready to hop the stone wall back home. No one is around. Nor will there be til the trash is dropped at end of night. So I'm choking. But instead of a gasp its a loud squeak. Reeeeeet, ruuuuuh. I'm grasping at my chest. Reereet, ruuuh. My vision fades and a fall down on my back. This dislodges the squeaker with one more loud REET. After a moment on the ground I get up and go home. Deciding I'll never take a squeaker again.

Why do I do this? Because it makes my wife happy and I want her to be happy.

So I told my wife that's fine - she doesn't have to, but that I'd also like to stop doing something which I hate - spending every friday with my in-laws.

She says I'm an asshole and that the situations are different. I disagree, we're both stopping something we hate despite it making the other happy. I think we're both within our right to do so and neither of us are assholes.

TIFU by burning 700 lbs of marijuana and getting half of the military high.,"While overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. We usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. Typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. Enough pot for a lifetime. The pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. Sometimes taller. It's grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. It's a remarkable sight. 

For those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, I would like to clarify‚Ä¶ I never touched the stuff overseas. Far too terrifying. They also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there's another reason to steer clear.

Anyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. Far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. Well one day while searching a suspected HME (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. If you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. My mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. A literal fortune. This looked like The Hulk fell into a wood chipper. 

A genius counterpart suggested that we bring Mt. Kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. 

""Well that's a clever idea!"" I thought, relieved that we wouldn't have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. 

Ah but ambushed, we were. The bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. I ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. 

&#x200B;

The early effects weren't bad. The smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, Tower 3. Jokes went around as we awaited the results. Coughing could be heard immediately and the private in Tower 3 called out to us: 

""Hey we need to‚Ä¶. We need to‚Ä¶ do something‚Ä¶ like‚Ä¶ now?"" I could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. 

This was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.

""Sergeant, I'm‚Ä¶ I'm high as shit!"" He yelled moments after. I panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. 

""Someone, relieve him!"" (genius)

Several individuals raced to take over Tower 3. We devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. How perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. Like a lazy pot-nado. Around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently Tower 2. Several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. 

""Who the hell approved this!!?"" The First Sergeant yelled

""I believe you did.."" The CO responded 

""Well where's the detail that brought it in?"" 

""That would be us First-Sergeant"" Myself and a couple others. I thought back to the decision-making process and realized that I had a ton of responsibility in the matter. In fact, I was *really worried.* Abnormally concerned‚Ä¶ I felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking ""ohjesusohjesusohjesus I'm going to get caught...!"" It was in that moment that I realized, I was sketching. I was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. 

I turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. My leaders did not need to see me drool. I hazily walked back toward Tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other's laps, goofing off, and having a 'deep philosophical conversation' about a bug's journey through life.

Inert.

I wrote Tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward Tower 2 to see if I could help, a big stupid smile on my face. They seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. Apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. I started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. We theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the Tower 2 crew.

I assume the wind was completely dead now, as I remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. [**Here**](https://imgur.com/a/LVZQg8F) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.

At this point I thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. Here I was reunited with half my squad. Instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and I could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. Minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. 

Although I was personally quite effected, I think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. A lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. I did not personally see it. I came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where I belonged. I theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. No repercussions followed.

TIFU by leaving a suicide note before running outside,"Okay so the obligatory this happened a few months back.

A little backstory, I have dealt with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, have a few (obviously) unsuccessful attempts. Good news; I'm better now and I laugh about it. I was better back then too.

Also worth mentioning I'm into writing short stories and currently a novel.

So back to the fuck-up, a short story I was writing back then started off with a 15 year old girl finding a suicide letter dated 10 years into the future, and is in her own handwriting. I bet you can see where this is going.. So I start drafting the letter and before I finish it with the dating and stuff I get a call from my friend saying she is around and wants to talk, so I get out saying very little to my mom.

After leaving in a hurry and staying outside for a few hours my mom gets worried and calls me. *Shocker* I left my phone at home. (It's really not a rare thing for me to do, it's rare I take it with me unless I'm going to school or a date or something) she goes into my room and sees ""my"" suicide note.

She gets scared and calls my dad. Soon after, my family is driving around looking for me. I walk back home and to my surprise there is police cars and my parents are crying. After a quick explaining and a few hours of scolding everything was fine but I felt terrible for putting my parents through that fear again.


TL;DR: Me, a previously suicidal teen, writes a suicide letter for a short story, then leaves the house in a hurry, parents call the cops thinking I killed myself, I show up eating ice cream and get scolded. Generally felt terrible

I think my 12yo daughter is being groomed online (WA State),"My 12yo daughter got introduced to Discord (a chat app) by a friend. She has since been involved in some pretty explicit sexual role play with what I can only assume are grown men. We have blocked all her access to the internet at home. She's given out our home number in the past, the town we live in, and her full name. She has recently been given a cell phone so that she can reach me during the day while I'm at work, and recently she's given  (at least) of these men her cell number and I've discovered some pretty gnarly messages. 

I've done a reverse phone look up and this particular guy seems to be in Ontario. 

He has told her that he is 18. I'm willing to bet he's older.

 She needs to be scared straight and this guy needs to know he's talking to a child. 

My husband says we need to call the police. 

I don't even know where to start. 

Can someone point me in the right direction. I'll be bringing it up to her therapist in the morning. 

[EDIT]

She has a therapist, thank you.  She is well supported at home, encouraged, etc.  Thank you, also, for all the parenting advice in a legal advice sub.  That was unexpected but not surprising.  This kid is well supported at home, cared for, encouraged, and supported in any way imaginable.  She's never been spanked, rarely yelled at, etc.  We are not permissive but neither are we oppressive.  She went down the anime path, which turned into the furry path, which escalated to the BDSM/Role Play sex chat that she's currently engaged in and I'm not even sure she knows what some of these things are she's talking about with these men.  I'm thinking she should watch the Cyntoia Brown documentary.  I've gone through her Discord chat history and it looks like she's telling people we abuse her, her dad is horrible, and that she's alone all the time (which, for the record, is by choice because I literally try to include her in EVERYTHING), all kinds of drama.  

Her phone is a basic flip-phone with no data plan. No apps.  I'm going to contact her school this morning and get her chromebook access revoked. 
 
The family computer is in my bedroom now and is under lock and key when I'm out.  

The wifi is locked down so most devices attached are ""asleep"" except for specific circumstances.

[SECOND UPDATE]

I spoke with our county sheriff.  Unless she told them her age explicitly, they won't do anything.  I connected with a guy using her Discord account and he eventually told me he thought she was 16.  He's clearly done this before, as 16 is a threshhold age.

UPDATE AITA for following my [42M] wife [27F] around for an evening?,"Here is a link to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxpblv/aita\_for\_following\_my\_42m\_wife\_27f\_around\_for\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/bxpblv/aita_for_following_my_42m_wife_27f_around_for_an/).

If you don't want to read it, here's the summary...I believed my wife to be having an affair with a coworker who had repeatedly appeared in her pictures and conversations. So, one happy hour, I followed her. Even though I had seen nothing definitive, I confronted her about the issue, and she threatened to end things with me.

Believe it or not, I listened to your advice. I received extensive advice from both sides. Publicly, everyone agreed I was at fault. In my direct messages, many fervently believed me to be in the right. Regardless, I sat down and talked to my wife about my insecurities concerning her coworker, Brandon. I told her I did not feel as attractive as Brandon and worried that as I was getting older, her interest in me was waning. I also asked her if she felt financially stable in the relationship. I apologized for following her and told her I would never do it again.

She told me several things. First, that she was offended I did not trust her. Second, that she did suspect Brandon had feelings for her based on some of his interactions and comments. Third, that she sometimes felt isolated by my work and never felt motivated one way or the other by my income. The thing about programming is it is hard to explain my work to someone who does not program.

She also told me my physical appearance and aging had no impact on her feelings towards me. She reaffirmed that she loved me and would never throw away our marriage for a divorced coworker.

So, what of our future? I asked her if she still wanted to be with me or if she could not see a future with me after I had followed her. She joked that she would forgive me after drinking a few cocktails at a tropical resort. She told me that in addition to the stalking, the cocktails would also help her forget about all of my past rants about various programming languages (Java, specifically). I haven't told her yet, but I plan to surprise her with an all inclusive package to the Maldives, or some other island young women enjoy that I never heard of until researching...

TIFU and punched a total stranger in the face,"This literally happened about 15 minutes ago. I was walking behind this lady pushing a pram with a kid inside playing with a helium  balloon. I suddenly see her baby accidentally let go of his balloon so I instantly turn on my hero-mode and extend my hand to grab the balloon string. It was a really epic and glorious moment and in my mind I was already playing out how cool I looked and how the lady would thank me for saving the balloon. Unfortunately, I did not manage to grab it in time. I did however end up with my hand in a closed fist straight into another man's cheek who was walking next to me. Now there's a crying baby in front of me and a very shocked, confused and upset stranger beside me. I think after the initial shock he did realise I was only trying to do a good deed so he didn't say anything to me but either way I immediately slowed down in embarrassment  and let them walk ahead of me...I am the hero this city does not need.

TIFU by sleeping with a married woman.,"So, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. NSFW or for anyone, really. And I may not be alive much longer, because I'm probably going to be murdered.

I'm at the bar the other night, watching the Hall of Fame Game. After it's over, I go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before I Uber home. This girl sitting next to me, very attractive. Out of my league. Like wayyy out. I'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. And she asks me 

""hey! Can I trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""Uhh what?""

 ""Can you watch my stuff while I go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust Greg, he's really nice"". Annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

Girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. Just random shit. Showed pictures of our dogs to each other. Talked about shows n stuff. Typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. She asks if I've ever seen the show Years and Years. I say ""no, but I've seen the band perform live"". So she goes on about how great the show is, and how I need to watch it. Asks if I have HBOGO. ""Yes because I forgot to cancel my cable after GoT"". So she makes me download the APP, so I could start watching it when I get home. Thanks for the recommendation! I'll probably check it out never. So a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""Yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. I have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""Idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""That's okay, I have pets too"" (or something like that. All I was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""I mean I guess, but I have to be at work early tomorrow""

""That's okay, I can only stay 30-40 minutes and then I'll have to go home""
""That's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time I'll need! AM I RIGHT, FELLAS??

No. Nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

It's about, 11pm at this point. I think? And mind you, I've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

So we tab out, get in her car. Which is a stick shift. And I say ""oh no shit, I like you even more now! No one drives a stick anymore! I drive one every day!"" Which I'm excited about, because at this point I'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows I like, and imma bout to get laid""

We talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). Which is just a half mile away. So was a short drive. She parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

Go inside, I try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. While I try to get my Chromecast set up on my living room TV. Ya know, to ""watch HBOGO"".

She runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

It's fucking Evan Williams.

And this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

Kids, I've slept with some strange in my time. I don't know how or why I get myself into these situations. I honestly feel that I'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. Sure I troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but I do genuinely care about other people. Being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. But in this case, I was dead wrong.

So after some talking about random shit. We get the show playing. I couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

Sex.

So after, we're just laying there. Pillow talk. Was a good night. I just got laid. She asked if she could stay the night. We're gonna go to sleep. Everything is cool. I let her know that I have to be at work in a few hours, so I need to get some rest.

Now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. Pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* Right?

Wrong.

I say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""I don't think so""

""What why?""

""I don't think my husband would appreciate that""



I am speechless. I don't think I've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. Millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. Like, how the fuck did I not see this coming. Omg imma home wrecker. I'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

Me: ""Ummmmmmm WHAT? Is this an open relationship? Does he know where you're at? Like, why didn't you tell me that?""

Her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""Uh yeah, I'd be pretty pissed if I was him""


Now I've been cheated on before. And that feeling sucks. I've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. Where I didn't know that I was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. I had found out a couple days later, and I found him on fb and let him know. He thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. Cheating is the worse thing ever.

So this is where shit starts to hit the fan. I don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

Her: ""we're getting separated soon""

Me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""Yea but that's okay""

""How is that okay?""

""He's been..... abusive""


There's a slight pause, then she starts crying. So this is where the sober me starts to kick in. This girl is struggling. She's in a bad spot. And no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. And now I'm trying to empathize with this trashy Evan Williams drinking bitch. Like I legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

Que the panic attack.

She starts going nuts. Ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. Knocking shit over. Basically trashing my house.

She asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. Which I do. She takes it. And calms down. (For the most part).

Now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. I tell her that we need to go to sleep. Because I have to work in the morning. She tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" Btw, Evan Williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

We finally get to sleep around 4? Maybe? I wake up late, she wants round 3. And who doesn't like morning sex. I'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. So I gave her a fuck.

Anyways, I need to leave for work. But her car is blocking mine. I tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. And told me I couldn't move it because ""I didn't know how to drive it"" 

""Uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. I drive a stick every day, I can move your car""

I move her car. I leave for work. And I just let her stay at my house. I let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. Two, I was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before I get home.

A couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. I get concerned, because I'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. I came to the conclusion that I should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... BUT, I see that she had already messaged him. FROM MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! My computer was still logged into fb when I left, and I didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

I tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. He lets me go home. When I get home, I find her still naked in my bed. I get her friend to get her an Uber. And I leave. Oh also had the sex one more time because ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Go back to work. Thinking everything is over. That's the end of that. Wrong again.

I get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. And only that shirt. Like vag all out and everything. This girl is afraid to go home. Which I'm worried about at this point. Because I want her to go somewhere safe. She's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

Oh yea, she had me find her phone. Which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. And several others from other people.

She hands me $20 to order a pizza. And after we eat the pizza, she'd Uber home. Fuckin bet. I ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

I kid you not. I'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. And she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

This bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and I'm just ready for her to leave.

Sex.

After, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. Asking to go home. And I'm like 

""I'll get you an Uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""No""

""What do you mean 'no'? You can't get in an Uber with your pussy out""

""No""


So I gather up all of her belongings and clothes. And try to help her get dressed. To which she refused to allow me to do.

Most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... That ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#I had the same feeling when I got her panties ON.

Pizza arrives. I go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. Come back inside. Panties are off again. God dammit.

We never even opened the pizza box. She's saying that she wants to go home. But is refusing to get dressed. I'm starting to panic myself. Because I don't know how I got myself into this situation. But, am me.

She eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. And I read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""I'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where I'm at"" ""come get me"". And him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

That last one though. That's what I did.

Before I called 911, I offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because I knew the husband would give her a ride back there. And not to my house. Because now I'm starting to worry about my safety. I don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. But then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. Even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

I told them that I have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. Etc. I tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

The ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. This girl is drunk crying. Trying to get me to go for yet another round. Where at this point, my dick hurts. Also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

Finally got her panties back on, I didn't tell her that I had called the cops. I told her that the Uber was coming. And was trying to get her to put her pants on.

Cops show up, I go outside. Explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. But I kept my calm. I told them that I was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. But they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. She wanted to go home. Officers ask if she was presentable. I pop my head back in the door. She's still wearing my shirt and her panties. So I'm like ""I guess?"", and then I let them in.

She yells ""are you fucking serious? You called the cops?"" 
""Uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. Even though you said you did. Plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what I did""

The officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

Que crying and what not.

Cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. Which I do. Her husband calls her phone, so I accept the call, and then put it up to her face. Tell her to tell him what's happening. And that she is getting an Uber home. Apparently her card and PayPal was getting declined for the ride. So she couldn't do it herself. They live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. I live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a Lyft/Uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. Once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... Girl finally decides to get dressed.

I had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... I could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. Lol.

Anyways, I hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. Made sure she had all of her belongings. We get her to walk out of my house to the Uber. But she tried to grab the bottle of Evan Williams. To where I audibly laughed. ""I don't think they'll let you take that""

Cops didn't let her take it. She got in the Uber and she was gone. Policeman handed me the bottle back. Where I say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

Po-po leave, I call it a night, and it's over.

Flash forward to today. I get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. I was at work at the time. So I wasn't able to check. But I'm 98% certain I handed those over to the cops. I look for them when I get home. Found nothing.

Oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

So that brings us to now. I haven't heard anything from her. Or the husband. And I'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. But ya. Know what? Fuck it. I'm glad I could share this story with y'all. There might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

The moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. üòÇ

Jk don't do that.

And don't stick your dick in crazy.

TLDR: Took a girl home who I didn't know was married. She trashed my house.

Edit: I'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while I deal with mine.

Edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2GIa

Edit 3: her car is still there. Can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. I'm still alive. I see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. I'll get to them when I can.

Edit 4: FML. I sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. No response. Bartender texted me late last night and asked if I used a condom. Which many of you have asked.... And no. I didn't. The girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. So I think I may have been baby baited.

Edit 5: I'm still not dead. Her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. I just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. So I walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... This woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. And she's most likely high on meth. Because when I asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" She said ""no, noooo hehe"" I'm like ""yea, I'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

My gf was raped and became pregnant. I broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby,"Really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my GF was raped. It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.

She was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.

Last week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

So we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

I flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.

She didn't want either of those things to happen, so I told her we were done...

AITA for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?,"Background: I graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. My sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. We both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. I pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

This is a throwaway and it's still fresh and I'm really emotionally charged right now. Last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. I overheard and I offered to help by paying more in rent (I was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. My parents were grateful. Now, prior to this, I never asked my how much sister pays in rent. I always figured my parents charged us the same. So absentmindedly I asked a follow-up question.

Me: How much is [my sister] paying [for rent]?

My Mom: Nothing.

A long ass pause.

Me: What do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

My Dad (visibly angry): Your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

My dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. She doesn't pay rent. She doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. So for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while I've been paying my parents.

So later that night we had a family sit down talk. My sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much I was paying. She offered $100. My parents suggested she pay $300, I pay $800 which my sister and I both rejected.

The conversation ended with this:

Sister: **FUCK YOU. I'M TRYING TO LIVE MY LIFE.** [These were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

So my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. I'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. My mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

So I say my part before leaving.

Me: I'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (It's only fair right?) And if I do pay rent, I pay whatever she's being.

My mom: What if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

Me: No.

My mom: But [me], we really need the money...

Me: That's too bad.

I get up and go off to my room.

So this morning my dad comes in tells me that I'M AN ASSHOLE FOR NOT PAYING RENT. That I should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. I'm like, ""what the hell? make [my sister] pay rent!""

My mom, who's listening in.

""You've seen her! She won't listen to us!""

Me: WELL THAT'S TOO BAD.

My mom (really angry): WELL WE WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM IF YOU DIDN'T TRY TO MAKE YOUR SISTER PAY RENT.

That was the last straw that blew it for me. I slammed the door on my parents.

"Holding students back from leaving the classroom due to one student acting up causes them to hate the teacher, not the one student.","Apparently my coworkers believe I should of held my class back today and not just the one student.

Apparently the students would hate the one student for holding them up and not teacher.

I always hated that because I could hear the grumbles and mumbles of an angry students. And the anger is towards me and not the one student. 

I feel like it is better to escort my class to the lunchroom. And escort the one student back to my class. That one student will see and hear all of their classmates having a fun time in the lunch room. Laughing, talking, goofing around, and trading food.

And be bummed sitting in the classroom alone and board with me. All I do is text my husband, go on reddit, and grade papers. That one student has to eat and think about their actions.

And after lunch my students get to run around and play on the playground. Depending how disruptive the student was, I keep them in for 5 or 10 minutes.

During this time I make the one student clean desks, staple papers together, or other minor stuff. 

After they are done, I ask them if they understood why I kept them in. Add a heart to heart chat. Tell them I appreciate the work they did in my room today. And let them go.

But today my coworkers told me I am doing it wrong. I need to keep my whole class in. The students will hate that one student and the one student will feel guilty enough to stop. Friends giving the friend the stink eye ensures that they won't act up again.

However 4/5 times the one student acting up is just part of a bigger problem. There could be stress at home that is causing them to act out. Having them alone in my room, time to calm down, think things out, and a heart to heart talk shows them that this is a safe place to talk with a trusted adult. 

It could be something small like stressing out over the next test. Or something big. I have had the toughest of bullies crying in my room because their parents are divorcing and they think it is all their fault.

I tried telling this to my coworker but they say if the student is really having trouble at home, they will to come to us for help.

I can't get half my students to admit when they need a pencil. I have one kid so shy he only speaks to me, the librarian, and his parents in whisper. Took me five months for me to get him to nod yes and no to me in front of the other students.

I don't know where my co-workers are getting the outgoing students.

Honestly, my shy student will be the only one happy staying in my room for lunch if one student acts up. But the rest will have the look of murder in their eyes. 

More so if it is Friday and pizza is being severed in the lunchroom. Hell if I hold my students up for a second on pizza day there will be a riot in my room. 

I been doing this since I first started teaching a couple years ago. Then again, I am a young teacher. And my coworkers are a bit older. Does experience have to do with it? Will I change my mind when I am older? 

For now, my method works. My class average is above the rest of my coworkers. My students are happy in class. I have a couple of students I see during recess and after school that just need to talk some stuff out. 

Unpopular opinion, I don't care. Holding class back over one student is bullshit. I hated it when I was school, I hate doing it now.",unpopularopinion

AITA for watching a WWE pay per view (Money in the Bank) on my phone while at a wedding that was meaningless to me?,"So this goes back almost a month now to May 19th but my wife and mom are still so furious with me that my wife may divorce me and my mom may take her side over it. I need some honest feedback to help me go forward. 

I'm a huge WWE fan and I pretty much get all the PPV. Money in the Bank, there was a ton I wanted to see but it also culminates several story lines into a ladder match that I really wanted to see. It was may 19th and I made it very clear I wanted to watch the event. On May 9th my wife announced that shed been invited to a coworkers wedding and I had to go with her (by a crazy coincidence that we didn't know until we got there, the grooms mom is my moms good friend). I assumed the wedding woukd be on Saturday so I agreed. Well Saturday the 18th came and went and it wasn't until the 19th when my wife was pissed I wasn't getting ready that I was like oh shit, I can't go because of rhe PPV. She got so mad at me so I relented and went. 

It was one of those events where there I didn't know a single person besides my wife and my mom and rhe groom was sort of a dick. So after he sort of blew me off when I tried to congratulate him I was like fuck this and I got out my phone, parked myself in the corner and bought the PPV. My wife and now mom kept trying to get me away and be social and finally I got pissed and told them both to leave me the fuck alone. 

Things honest to god haven't been the same since. She says I looked like such and asshole with my phone in my face in a semi-dark room while everyone else was having fun and dancing. My mom says her friends all noticed me and commented that I must have been autistic or retarded so she's massively embarrased. 

To me I had plans, I did my part to attend and when I didn't know anyone I made the best of a bad situation to do what I wanted anyways.

Was I the asshole?


edit: 

to address the common repeats:

1. No I don't do network, my wife would come unglued if I have 24/7 access to something she hates so much. I still do PPV even though its more expensive. 

2. Invitation was only 10 days in advance because the bride claims she just ""forgot"" to send our invitation and only realized at the last minute when ""we"" hadn't RSVP'd. That's the bride and my wife's story, believe it if you do or don't. 

3. Yes it was a crazy coincidence my mom was at the wedding. But since we got a late invite and I don't speak with my mom all that often I would have no way of knowing in advance. The bride is my wife's coworker, the groom's mom is my mom' friend from some charity they work on together. I'd never met any of them.

"[GA] Just moved into a condo, neighbor is tasing hell over my nonexistent pet bird","I just bought a condo that has been vacant for a while. Right after I bought the place, before I even started moving in, I got an official warning from the HOA that my next door neighbor has called their emergency line 3 times over my pet bird that is so loud in the mornings it startled him awake and caused him emotional distress. In their email they specifically said what time my bird was making these loud noises. 

Now, the thing is I don't have any pets, and for the past few nights I've stayed up to that specific time to see if I could here anything loud and disturbing as he described(which I did not, aside from a few birds chirping quietly outside). However, this neighbor is still calling the HOA's emergency line every night to complain about my bird. The HOA manager doesn't believe I don't have a pet bird, even though I've offered to let him come see. He said that I could just be hiding the bird.

Today I got a letter from Animal Welfare and Enforcement about my bird's vocalizations disturbing the peace. It said that I can be taken to court because of my bird if the neighbor complains again. I DON'T HAVE A BIRD OR ANY PET.

I've tried talking to the guy, but he refuses to answer his door, and when he comes out to watch me leave for work, he'll shut his door and ignore me if I try to talk to him. Am I seriously going to have to go to court because this guy thinks I have a pet bird? How am I supposed to prove that I don't have a bird? ",legaladvice

AITA for saying I wont pay for my daughters education if she switches her major?,"As I said in my title, last night I sat my daughter down and told her that if she switches her major I will cease her tuition payments.

My daughter is currently a freshman in college. She has just started her first semester and I'm the one paying the bill. I have been saving for over 10 years to do this and I am happy to do it, as long as I feel she is actually setting herself up for success. During high school my daughter my daughter fell in love with computers. She took ever class she could on programming and computer science and declared that her major going into school. I supported her through all this because I thought this is what she loved and felt it set her up for a good job after school.

This last week she was on fall break so she came to stay with me over the weekend after spending a few days at my ex's house. My daughter yesterday morning decided to casually drop that she's planning on changing majors. I was shocked by this and asked why and what she was changing to. She is planning on switching into the liberal arts program. Now I know the major is the go to punching bag and it feels cliche, but I was honestly a little shocked by how casually she acted about this. When I tried to get why she was switching all I got was that she all of the sudden hates computer science and has made multiple friends who are majoring in LA. Apparently she has been talking with the councilors up there as well and they along with her friends have all recommended she switch majors.

I tried to ask her the regular stuff ""what about your future"", ""How do you plan to get a job"", etc. And she decided to ignore me and tell me that it's none of my business and that she's an adult. This angered me. I'm the one paying for this I feel I have a right to know and not be blown off like that. I thought over it all day and so last night I sat her down and told her that while yes, she is an adult. I am the one paying for her education and I won't be paying for her to get what is in my opinion a worthless degree. I told her if she doesn't want to do CS that's fine. But she needs to put more thought into the change and find something that she enjoys AND can get her a career. And if in the end she decides that she's an ""adult"" and she wants to be a liberal arts major. She can pay for it like an adult should, with her own money.

This did not sit well with her. We fought and she left saying i'm trying to control her life with money and am being a major asshole. My ex called me up after and told me that I'm no better than a dictator right now and that I'm using her college fund as ransom for her to do what I want.

&#x200B;

All I want is for my daughter to have a good life and job prospects. AITA here?

Edit:

Wow, did not expect this.

I have read a good amount of the responses on here and through the people who have messaged me. Before I say anything else let me clarify my position a bit because I see the same question sent to me and I don't feel like responding to hundreds of people individually.

I do not have a problem with my daughter getting a LA degree.

If my daughter called me up now and gave me her reasons for switching and a legitimate plan for how she will use this degree to secure a career, I would support her 100%. I don't care what my daughter does with her life. I just want her to do something with her life. I am looking to spend over one hundred thousand dollars over the next 4 years. The least I feel I can ask of my daughter is to have a plan in mind before she decides to make changes on my dime. I get that young adults who go to college are using this as a avenue to find themselves and explore. And many of you have told me that I should not treat this as setting her up for a career, and instead treat this as a ""academic experience"" to teach her life lessons. For those two last points, I feel you are wrong.

This money that I have saved is not a ""gift"". This is what I have saved for 10 years to make sure that she has opportunities that me my ex never had. This is my investment in her. For people who claim that I should be throwing my money at her no questions asked and support her, I respectfully disagree. Giving my daughter money for free, in my opinion, is the worst thing I could do for her right now. Supporting her as she makes a choice she has given me no justification for that will cost me thousands of dollars will kill me. And the fact that she seems to think that I am owed no explanation and that I should ""mind my own business because she's an adult"" is an insult to the investment I am making in her.

I am not arguing whether or not I am wrong. If you all feel I am an asshole for this, then I will accept that.

&#x200B;

I called my daughter and left a message saying that I wish to talk with her about this and that I feel we left off in a bad place and wish to talk about this more. If my daughter wants to go into LA, then that is her choice. Weather or not I pay for it will be mine.",AmItheAsshole
Police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him,"This happened last week, he's only 11. At around 10AM my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

They then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. The biggest issue is NO ONE CALLED US. Not the school, not the police no one. We got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1PM).

We called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.

We got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).

We continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

We get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""Creepers"" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

When they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

They kept offering him McDonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

The school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. What the hell do we do?

Edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.",legaladvice
WIBTA if I don't disclose that I'm a product of incest to my present partner or potential future partners,"I (22F) was adopted as an infant and never really knew much about my biological family since it was a closed adoption. I received infrequent letters and photos from my biological mother. I connected with my mother, half sister and aunt during my freshman year of high school. I still really don't know anything about my family because my biological mother  is a chronic liar. However, she did tell me that my father was no longer  around and had no interest in meeting me. I talked to my half sister and she said that she was told by our grandmother that it was due to him being a familial relation. I did some research, and was able to corroborate with DNA testing that he is indeed my mother's first cousin. Obviously that was shocking, and I feel like my existence was a mistake. I've been struggling with it. Thankfully, from what I've read, there's very minimal genetic overlap in that kind of relationship and I don't have any medical issues. I do wear contacts, have ADHD, Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Auditory Processing Disorder, and I'm prone to getting lung infections (mother smoked while pregnant). But none of these are major in the slightest and I live a very normal, slightly more anxious, life. I'm in a relationship right now, I don't know how long it'll last or if it'll last. I would love to eventually marry him but I'm 22 and I'm  being a realist here. WIBTA if I didn't tell him since there's virtually no chance our kids would have issues....and also I'm scared that he would break up with me because of it.

Edit: I honestly did not think this would blow up so much. Really glad this is a throwaway. I guess some info for people.

1. My mother didn't know she and my father were related. Growing up she never knew her mother's side of the family as my grandmother abandoned them for her second family. My parents were very much in love and dated as teenagers, it wasn't a sexually abusive situation. They went to the same high school and they didn't look related in the slightest, or share the same last name (I think their mothers were siblings). Mother found out when grandma got a divorce and came back into her life, I think they my parents were 18-19 
because it was right after high school. 

2. Boyfriend and I have been together about a year, which isn't long but I can see it leading to marriage. Also he's not American, so no chance of us being related! Trying to keep it out of the family. 

3. Views of incest are a bit different here in America for you non Americans. Especially since I live in a very religious area, my family are strict Catholics. It's not illegal everywhere, but it is in some states.

"My mom took 15.000 out of my savings to pay for a new car, I need advice","So I will try and keep this short.

I have always had a close relationship with my mom, after my parents divorced I chose to live with her, I have always trusted her and so on.

Now we have never been rich, but we got by, I have always worked since I could in order to buy things like games, clothes, a phone and so forth since these large non essential things were too difficult for my mom or dad to afford, basically we had no money for big non essentials.

Now because of this I quickly started saving my money, pretty much, I would usually save up at least half of what I made in a month in order to be able to have some spending money and money to buy furniture when I moved out and such.

So I turned 18 several months ago and started arranging accomodations for college next year and working full time this year so I wanted to see how much I had saved.

Well you can see where this is going, I looked at it and there was about 4000 where there was supposed to be 19000, so I freaked the fuck out and called my bank, well to make a long story short after confronting my mom and dad since they were the only ones with the ability to go in to my bank account, she explained she used ""Some of my money"" to buy her shiny new car several months ago, so I yelled at her and said she did not use some of it she drained 3/4ths of my savings to buy a new fucking car. She started crying saying she wanted the car but only had 10000 saved and the car was 25000, so she figured it was fine and she would pay it back in the next few years. I know she cant because it took her years to save up the 10000, I mean the best case scenario would be her paying back 200 a month which would mean she would take like 6 years to pay it back. My dad lost it on her as well, he is very mild mannered and rarely shows emotion whatsoever but he was seething and told her to sell the goddamn car, her laptop and everything worth a damn in the house to pay it back or he would sue her.

Well this was 2 weeks ago, I have since received 200 from her and apparantly the car is up for sale but given she bought it months ago it is likely in the best case scenario it will fetch like a third of what she bought it for.

In the meantime I have moved in with my dad who lives 15 minutes from my mom at his behest, my dad and my moms otherwise amicable relationship has completely collapsed, my mom has been begging me to talk to her and saying how sorry she is.

Now here is what I said, untill I have every penny back I wont even consider talking to her again and even then she has so much making up to do I doubt I will ever forgive her. I need advice for how to go about this as my dad wants to sue her.",relationship_advice

"All bodies are not beautiful, healthy bodies are beautiful.","I'd like to preface this by saying that I do appreciate the spirit behind the statement that all bodies are beautiful. I think it's very cool that people want others to feel accepted and comfortable despite being different than a perceived majority. 

However, all bodies are not beautiful, and we shouldn't pretend they are. People that are overweight to the degree it affects their health are not beautiful, they're unhealthy. They don't deserve to be mistreated for it, but they also shouldn't be constantly validated. 

There is a biological standard for objective physical attraction partially rooted in physical health. We are not attracted to people that won't be healthy mates. We are not attracted to people that look unhealthy. We should stop pretending unhealthy bodies are attractive because they aren't. I hate seeing people validate someone's unhealthy lifestyle because they don't want them to feel bad. It's not a good way to help people, it just makes things worse.

Edit 1: Reading the comments I saw a few people telling me that I was talking about a skinny body and that I should clarify that. That's not quite true. Skinny can also be unhealthy and therefore unattractive, but it is true that I am mostly addressing weight when I talk about a healthy body. 

Edit 2: I don't think that amputations or scars make a person not beautiful. If your body is healthy, it's beautiful. It's a very cut-and-dry opinion. If you have scars, had an amputation for medical reasons, or anything like that your body can certainly still be beautiful. I only want my post to address things that are in the control of the person.

Edit 3: Hopefully my final edit. I'm sorry if I have been unclear. I have a lot of comments about how beauty is subjective, so let me clarify: this post refers to an objective standard of physical attraction that is held by having a healthy body and lost by having an unhealthy body. I understand attraction can have a subjective element, that's not where my opinion is based though!",unpopularopinion

Tifu by not understanding that 3.5 grams can be a fuckload,"This actually did happen within the last 24 hours, I'm still lying in bed trying to recover. 

So, weed has been legalized, yay Canada! Obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. My girlfriend and I had a free weekend (kids weren't here), and that won't happen again for a while, which adds further justification. But we live in an apartment building, we don't want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.

I figured, hey, let's keep it conservative, never done this before, don't want to put too much in there, right? I mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it's just marijuana. Fucking harmless. So I spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of MK ULTRA and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. Which were quite good.

We cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. Now, I am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. But, I'm pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *APPARENTLY* you should start with 10 mg. See how that goes. But on Friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and I didn't feel a damn thing.

We started with two brownies each. Two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. I was fine. So I had another one. An hour later, she could barely walk. I didn't feel it as bad as her. So, I had one more. That's 6/15, not even half the batch between us.

Turns out MJ is a helluva drug. Jesus Mother-fucking Christ. We spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. Oh my lawd, I had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. My mind is blown. I could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this ""big deal"" where my girlfriend and I had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there's a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!

We were wrecked. About halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. We just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. My girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. She wanted to call an ambulance. None of this is hyperbole. We're both exhausted and sore from the twitching. The dry mouth might've been the worst part. It was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. 

We threw the rest of the brownies out. The smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.

TLDR: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. Both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. It waaaaaay too much.

Edit: thanks for the gold! And silver! And platinum! Kinda worth it...?

Edit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. I honestly, sincerely hate the waste. But we couldn't even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. That would be unforgivably irresponsible. 

Edit 3: I *DID* do research, I just didn't do enough. We have now learned correct math from the comments. You're **supposed** to dose edibles using the THC percentage. This stuff has been tested at 18%. So, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and I had 168... Holy fuck.

Edit 4: I used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. Every 10 minutes I topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. There wasn't much smell at all. I can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.

**Final edit**: Some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn't get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. For those making **positive** contributions, thank you! We're enjoying them! 
1. They say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *Wait longer*! Like, a day. It is not worth the risk of having too much.
2. There's a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.
3. There's a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. I fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. So keep that in mind. ",tifu
AITA for grounding my son for the rest of the year and forbidding him from seeing his girlfriend (or any of his friends) privately because I found out he wasn't using condoms?,"Two days ago, my 16 year old son came to my wife and I freaked out. He said he's scared for his life and he doesn't know what he's going to do. We had to calm him down and to make a long story short, he thinks he got his girlfriend pregnant. He said she missed her period weeks ago and he doesn't know what he's going to do because he's not ready to be a father. His girlfriend is vehemently pro-life, so there's not anything he can do.

I asked him how could this happen; why wasn't she taking her reproductive health seriously and be on birth control, and ESPECIALLY, why isn't he especially not taking him reproductive seriously by using condoms. He said that his girlfriend's parents are strict, so she has no way to access them, and to condoms, he said and I quote ""Condoms feel like having sex with a thick garbage bag."" Apparently, they relied on the calendar method and pulling out because ""together, it's almost impossible to get pregnant.""

I was **infuriated**. I've talked to him ALL the time about safe sex. We're no prudes; we knew that once he got a girlfriend, he'd start having sex. Which is why we emphasized being *safe*. We've just have had this conversation so many times; I was just so. Angry. That my son would do this to his life, and potentially wreck his entire life. 

I told him that this was his fuck-up, and he has to take responsibility. Effective immediately, he is going to have to get a job and work 40 hours a week and start building a savings. Additionally, he has shown that we cannot trust him to make responsible decisions, and he's effectively grounded until the end of the year. He can spend time with his friends at our house only, with all the doors open, and he cannot go upstairs with any girl at all. He can also only do this only when we're home (we live in a gated community so this is easily enforceable). That means no sleepovers, no parties, no going to the pool (unless we go with him), no nothing. If he wants to go somewhere like out to eat with his friends, we'll use find my iPhone to track him. He said he understood.

He came to us today with great news; his girlfriend got her period. He asked now that she's not really pregnant, can the punishment be less strict, and that he promises to start using condoms now, but my wife and I want to stick to our guns on this. Though with the added stipulation that he can work 20 hours a week instead, and it can be a mixture of volunteer and actual work. But he's shown us he's downright irresponsible and we just plainly cannot trust him until he matures. 

My son maintains that we're being WAY to harsh, and that he realizes his mistake now, but he's also said in the past that he'd never have sex without a condom because ""he's not an idiot."" We just plainly cannot trust him right now. Are we being unreasonable?

TIFU GF walked in on me soaking my willy in a glass of milk,"I'm in the Navy, and about 4 years ago I was stationed in Cuba. I had a new girlfriend that I was trying to impress by cooking her dinner (even though I was a horrible cook).

I decided I was going to make some jalape√±o poppers as a side dish, and foolishly decided to use my finger to scoop out the seeds before stuffing them with sour cream.

Once everything was prepared I popped them into the oven and decided to take a shower while I waited.

Naturally, being a guy I decided to have a wank in the shower. No harm no foul right? 

WRONG.

I felt the burn with every stroke, but I was so close to finishing I just...decided to bust a nut... and then I would figure out what to do next. (Yes, I know this is my own fault, I'm not proud of it okay?)

Unfortunately that 10 minutes of wanking only further cemented the juices from the jalape√±os deeper into the skin of my penis. (Shocking I know).

The pain soon became unbearable, I was rushing around my barracks room butt naked desperately trying anything I could think of to alleviate the pain: washing my member off with a clean towel, putting ice cubes between my penis and my ballsack, standing in front of the fan, nothing was working. 

Then it dawned on me. I recalled hearing that milk can help alleviate the burn in someone's mouth after eating spicy food.. and I knew this was my only hope.

I filled up a glass with ice cold milk, set it on the floor, and squatted down on top of it, dunking my bits into the heavenly, cooling liquid.

Instant relief. Thank God, I said to myself. There was only one problem, the moment I took my penis back out of the milk, the pain rushed back to my lions.

So I sat there, in a squatting position, my dick afloat in a glass of milk, and realized my blinds were wide open, on a sunny afternoon. Anyone could look in and see what was happening. But the pain was so bad that I couldn't keep my dick out of the milk for more than a second or two.

I decided that the only solution was to lay on the ground, face down ass up, so that if I was to flash someone at least they would only see my ass cheeks and not my burning schlong.

I laid there for about 2 hours until my girlfriend came back from work, and found me in my miserable state. 

After a lot of laughter and about 10 minutes of explaining the situation, she asked me ""why didn't you just press the glass of milk into your body with one hand, so you could walk around and put some clothes on and stuff?

Needless to say, if I didn't feel like an idiot before, I did then. 

Eventually a few hours later I went to the emergency room, where I was given a cream that barely worked, and I was excused from work the next day.

TL;DR

Made jalape√±o poppers, wanked in the shower, willy burned with the fury of a thousand sons, dipped it into a glass of milk while lying naked on the floor, girlfriend walked in. 
We are no longer dating, but I hope her thinking back on my embarrassing story puts a smile on her face now and then.

AITA for scaring my my daughter to teach her not to scare animals?,"My daughter is 8, and has developed a bad habit of scaring and disturbing animals for fun.


She would jump from behind with a stomp and a ""WA!"" to any animals minding their own business, be it birds, stray cats and dogs and even butterflies and give them a fright, usually resulting them to either run or fly away. 


We tried talking and scolding her, but she just brushed them off. She thought it was okay as long as she doesn't physically harm them.


So a while earlier she was on the sofa playing Nintendo switch, looking very focused, and I decided to let her have a taste of her own medicine.


I approached her from the back quietly before snatching the controller from above(in case she dropped it) with a stomp and a ""WA!"". She was dazed for a moment before bursting into tears. 


My wife called me a childish AH for scaring her like that, but I meant it as a lesson for her to know how animals feel like when she scared them since words could not get to her. AITA?


Edit: I did talked to her and explain why I did it after she calmed down but my wife got in the way and insisted I apologise and make it up for her. I don't think that's appropriate since that defeats the purpose of teaching her a lesson, so I ended up posting on reddit to see if I am really in the wrong.

TIFU twice by grabbing a new coworkers boob and then forgetting her husband died,"   Happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. On Wednesday's our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it's a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. It is normal to carpool all together and naturally I drive my two friend-coworkers each time. However this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we'll call her Sarah (changed). She's quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. While everyone is leaving the office for lunch I offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. Now here's where the first fuck up happens.
   While on the way to the restaurant Sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. Everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. Traffic comes to a halt and I slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. I check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing I am currently full on honkin Sarah's right knocker my words start to trail off. ""Damn I hope everyone is oka....."" that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. Amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that I was just reacting to the situation. For the next few minutes the car was silent until Sarah said ""that's funny I haven't had that much action in a while"" which eased the mood and the car all laughed. And fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying ""ahh well we all have our dry spells."" Something I thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. She goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. 
   We get to lunch and everything seems okay but Sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so I ask what's up. She told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. I instantly apologized saying I had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that I was sorry. She said she didn't care about that and that it was fine it's just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. My heart sunk. I had completely forgotten about her husband. I felt so bad I instantly started apologizing for everything in the world I felt horrible. My friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. Sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. I feel so horrible that I have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. Please reddit help me feel a little better.

I have been doing a lot of reflection on my actions over the past months since my post, including taking into account all of the advice I was getting from my last post.

I have decided to get therapy (which I probably should have done a long time ago I acknowledge) and work on my issues so I can start to be the father to Jack that he deserves but never had.

I reached out to him a few days ago to express this to him and he said that while he appreciates that I'm trying, it's going to take him a long time to get over all the bullshit I put him through but that he is willing to try. 

He is honestly such an amazing kid and even though his mom and I don't get along at all, I will say she did good in raising him. 

We have a plan to talk every other day on the phone along with some in person visits and if he feels up to it, I would like to invite him and his boyfriend out for dinner sometime.

I know I have a lot of work to do but I'm trying to be a better man. That includes staying sober. Maybe even my two sons could be friends one day.

"[Update] [Virginia] - I caused an accident, lady I hit refuses to take payout from Insurance, thinks I should pay because I need to ""learn my lesson""","Original thread here - https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/612803/richmond_va_i_caused_an_accident_a_year_and_a/

The lady I hit, for several weeks, refused to take the (verbally) agreed upon settlement and my insurance company put it on the back burner. In June they gave her 30 days to respond or they would rescind the offer. 

In the middle of June she hired a lawyer not connected to her insurance, rather a personal injury atty. I got a letter from the law firm telling me that I was going to be sued if I did not compensate their client the $40,000 she thinks she's owed from the car accident.

I kicked the letter off to my insurance company; I first called then emailed it: My adjuster that I was working with had an audible ""siggggghhhhh..."" after I read him the letter. Then a strained chuckle. ""We will take care of this.""

I heard back from them on Wed the 5th - They sent all documentation of the accident, the audio recording of her verbally agreeing to the settlement amount, and her ""manifesto"" to her newly hired atty. They apparently also included a note that stated that they were giving her until the end of June to accept the money or they would rescind the offer if she did not get this taken care of soon. 

My adjuster called me this morning to tell me that the issue has been resolved. She has signed an agreement yesterday that she cannot sue if she takes the money. According to my adjuster, they re-offered her the $40,000 because of two things: Primarily they wanted this to just go away and they did not want to be sued for more, second they apparently know of this personal injury atty, he requires a VERY high contingency percentage and this woman essentially played herself by hiring someone that was not necessary. He collected on her behalf and took his cut.

That's all I know, so yeah. Issue resolved and my insurance has jumped up a small bit in cost due to the accident. ",legaladvice

We spoke via text and then I called her at lunch. It escalated where I was repeating my discontent with her accepting ostensibly platonic dates from random men and her stating men and women can simply be friends and that I should trust her.

&#x200B;

I stated they can be friends, but I expressed the nature of her relationships with men, is simply is not something I'm comfortable with, and I try to reject, not encourage women who ask me out for friendly coffee dates because I know better.

I expressed her declining a date with me so she and a random man can drink at her place and attend a house party is a deal breaker.

She doesn't, and that's fine, we're all entitled to our own expectations.

&#x200B;

I don't think she cheated. I know she appreciates male attention - perhaps more than she appreciates being in a committed healthy relationship where communicated boundaries are observed. Accordingly, most of her friends are male, some of which still have romantic interests in her. Some men are okay with that, I'm evidently not.

AITA for excluding my blind friend from my wedding?,"I have a friend, Bobby (not his real name), who struggles with his eyesight. He's quite quiet and solemn most of the time, but he's a solid guy and he's good to spend time with. We met at college a couple of years ago and have taken tons of classes together. First year we lived together, and have stayed friends since I moved out. After the first couple of weeks of knowing him, it emerged that he was registered blind. He's not completely without his sight so it's not like we didn't notice this guy with a cane and a dog, it's just that he needs mega sized text to read, and he's not allowed to drive or get his license. He's completely independent though, and has a free public transport card to get the bus and train since he can't drive. He's always been a bit of a home bird as well, so every weekend he'd travel  about 2 hours back up home, and 2 hours back, so that he could visit his mum and dad.


Now my fianc√© and I have been dating for over 4 years and have been engaged for 18 months. As is the way with weddings, we sent out save the dates and invites along the way, and Bobby received both. Because I'm not a very organised human, the wedding invites went out a little later than they traditionally might, but since everyone who was coming knew about the wedding in advance, and received a save the date, it was fine. We had a few people who missed the RSVP date by a couple of days but no harm no foul in my eyes. The RSVP date was set for exactly one month before the wedding. 


Background backgrounded. Now for the potential assholery.


Bobby also missed the RSVP date. He wasn't the only one I had to chase up a week later, but he was the only one who read the message and then took two further days to reply with a yes. Today, less than two weeks before the wedding, he's messaged saying he can only come to the wedding if he can have a plus one. The reason for his plus one is his eyesight. Because he doesn't drive and he's not local he needs someone, his mum, to be present to drive him there and back. I flat out told him no, he's not inviting his mum as a plus one because we've already told the hotel the number for the meal, but she's welcome at the rest of the day. 
The hotel in reality doesn't need the numbers up till 48 hours before, but the table plans are set, there's no easy space to slot her in, and I don't want a friends mum that nobody knows enjoying the wedding meal and speeches, and us paying for the privilege. I now doubt whether he'll come, because I don't know if she's happy coming all the way, to not even be fed.


Am I the asshole?




*Edit:* A few things to update here. I've been chatting to the friend more. Despite what you all think, I do actually care and the nuances of how much a person can see can't be put across in a AITA post. The mother is welcome at the full day, except the meal. And by the tone of Bobbys message, it wasn't Bobby asking for his mum to be there, but Bobbys overprotective mum asking that she attend. Ceremony and evening do is fine, and I told Bobby as much when he first messaged yesterday. I've since reached out and offered to pay for the mum at the second restaurant that's on site.

Additionally, something of note is that my family are all not local. It's either a flight or a ferry for them to get to the wedding, and to cater for both my family and other guests who can't/won't drive, we hired a bus for a city centre pick-up. The bus takes people down to the church, then back to the reception venue. It's only getting home again that people need to manage themselves, but various people are staying in the same hotel that the reception is at. Travel arrangements have been a big part of the wedding, and Bobby has been invited to use them from the start.

To those saying he needs eyes for the evening. I'm not disagreeing with you to be flippant of his needs, or to be callous, even if I am still an asshole. I'm saying having known him for 2 years, he doesn't need his mother there. There are plenty of college friends there, who he's seated with, who can help him find his seat or point out the loos. It's a group of friends and we've all been there to support him when necessary (which is genuinely rare, because as I said, he is *fully* independent, even in new environments).

Taking everyone's advice I announced that I was going to be moving out. My now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. I told him yes, but I'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. He decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. It's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. My landlord is XRMs(ex-roommate) family friend, after XRM explained the situation I ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

XRM and XGF and a few other friends helped me move in. I had a house warming party and was specifically asked that I not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. XRM and XGF also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. My XGF stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. She said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. She told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. It was great. We've gone out a few times since our first date. 

The past few weeks have been the best in a long time, I never really realized how bad my situation was. Obviously everything isn't perfect, and I still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but I'm in an infinitely better position than before.

[Update] [MN] School is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. I'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.,"I'm updating [my last post](https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

I did what you all told me to do. I wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. I also called them. They said they will speak with the school.

I was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. I did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

I said loudly ""I think you owe me an apology.""

She said ""yes, I should not have accused you of cheating.""

I said ""Yes, and another apology for saying I don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

She said ""I'm sorry"" and left.

The principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

I said ""It wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

He apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. I then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

So things are sorted out now. But also, I'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. I only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and I was very pissed off at them. And the counselor had given me horrible advice.

"Update, my son took the Boba Fett figure.","So, I never honestly expected the post I made to get where it did. I also never expected the barrage of support and hate. I will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.

&#x200B;

So, why am I back? Well, because I feel like I need to be. I'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how I acted or seek validation. I'm here because I feel that for myself I need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200B;

So, I want to talk about something first before I get into the update. Many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how I reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. I was also hit pretty hard for how I was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. To give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. We have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. We're just to different in some senses. He's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. In these past few years we've tried to fix this. Work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. During our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and I wont lie I never understood the appeal. It is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200B;

So, when my son stole and damaged his property I didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. So when he asked for 2,000 to fix it I really didn't feel like it was worth it. Was this wrong of me? Maybe. I don't feel bad about defending my son, I only feel bad that I discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200B;

Sorry about that. Like I said, I don't want sympathy. I only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

So, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. I had no idea what I was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. We collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. During this time I got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. I offered to pay in full.

(Also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so I asked him. He had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

My brother said he plans to not sue us. His renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. At first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. This was the plan until last night.

During the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. It turns out my son stole the figure to sell. He had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. He didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

Suffice to say, I am not happy about this. I won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. My brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. Some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly I think this might be for the best in the end. The way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and I believe the only option that I can live with myself making is this. I will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

So, thank you all for the advice. The support and hate are what I needed as a true wake up call. Like I said, I don't need pity. I'm doing this so that I can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.",legaladvice

[CA] Grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. Brother sold his when they were worth a car. I left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. Brother and his girlfriend want my half now.,"When my brother was 16 and I was 4 my grandmother set aside a share portfolio for us. As soon as we were old enough it was transfered into our own accounts, and it was only four years later that my brother dipped heavily into his and bought a new honda.

I knew about mine for much longer than he did before it became mine, and watched it grow since I understood what it was. By the time I was given full control it was already worth a ridiculous amount because a big portion of it was invested in apple, and I'm torn on using the funds locked up as they are, because Dad drilled it into me to leave it to grow until I'm forty something.

I don't talk much with my brother, he's done some stupid things to the family over the years and I didn't really grow up with him so all I usually hear about his life comes through dad. His new girlfriend works in law though, and I've received a formal letter from them both that the investments my grandmother made were designed to be for both of us to use not just for me alone, and his was only around $15000. The number is right but mine was only worth that at the time he spent it too. They want half of the value of mine now and his girlfriend has informed me if I don't give them access then the legal fees and fines would eat up my half and I'd be left with nothing.

The dividends alone support a huge part of my life and they've saved me a few times. If half of that disappeared it'd set me back years. I know it sounds selfish but I'm really used to having the extra income back me up when I've wanted to move. I've lived in four states by my own choice and I want to move and take in more before I settle down, if I ever do.

How likely is it they'll win and leave me with nothing? As far as I know there was no paperwork or will just my grandmother's word. She set up my brother's accounts when he turned 19, but she gave them to dad at the same time as my brother got his, and dad transfered the whole lot to me six years ago. For my share I have all the logins, the trading accounts and bank accounts are in my name, and the shares are all solely in my name too.

AITA for forbidding my wife to go to her affair partner's funeral?,"Married 15 years and almost didn't make it this far.  In our second year of marriage my wife went home when I was deployed and slept with Some Dickhead (who I'll refer to as SD from here out) who she was loose acquaintances with growing up.  She hadn't seen him in years but he just happened to show up during my daughter's birthday party because he was the son of one of my mother-in-law's old friends.  SD and my wife hooked up later that week after reconnecting.

&#x200B;

The reason I didn't kick my wife's ass to the curb and eventually forgave her is because she told me herself soon after I got home.  And she didn't try to justify it with the ""oh well you were gone, i felt lonely blah blah blah"".  No she actually said straight up that she was a fucking dumbass (her words not mine, though I agree) and she felt so sick and disgusting for doing it.

&#x200B;

She immediately cut off all contact with SD and it took a lot of counseling and healing but here we are today; feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her.

&#x200B;

Well my mother-in-law called yesterday and she heard from SD's mother that SD died in some workplace accident and they're having a funeral service this weekend.

&#x200B;

My wife told me this and that she wanted to go and it was like I got kicked right in the dick.  I instantly felt nauseous and had fucking horrible flashbacks of when she told me about her affair. All those horrible feelings resurfaced along with the shitty memories of me crying my fucking eyes out and my image of her shattering.  The pain felt as fresh as when she dropped that bomb on me.

&#x200B;

I asked her why seeing as she hadn't talked to the guy in over a decade not to mention...you know....she fucked him while we were married.  She keeps saying shit like ""it's the right thing to do"" and ""she just wants to pay respects"".

&#x200B;

I can't stop repeating that I'm so hurt with that decision as he's had no part of her life in so long and I'm re-living all those shitty nights I was sure our family would be shattered and I would only see my daughter 50% of the time.

&#x200B;

After some back and forth I put my fucking foot down and told her NO, she cannot go.  I said it's so disrespectful to me and our marriage and we've been on the silent treatment since then.  AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Seems like people are starting to trip up on me saying ""feels like non-stop since that time that my wife has gone above and beyond proving that I was right to keep her."" as if I'm saying I own her and she's a piece of property to me.  That is not the case, I am simply illustrating that she didn't just say she'll do better, she proved it with her actions and has made me a very happy man in our time together.

EDIT 2: I apologize for nothing and honestly it brings a happy tear to my eye to to see so many people referring to him as SD, because that's what he was.  Fuck 'im.

A lot of people are saying it's her decision to make and it is but that doesn't mean I have to like it or support it, and yes right at this point I can see myself walking away if she insists on going.  We're going to counseling starting tomorrow",AmItheAsshole
You're a piece of shit if you try to get somebody fired for their off-work behavior.,"I keep seeing these posts where somebody posts something racist on social media and somebody contacts their employer to try and get them fired. It seems to be one of the first reactions or pieces of advice every time somebody feels wronged.

&#x200B;

People have the right to be a piece of shit outside of the work place. The punishment has no relation to the offense and its basically thought crime. Its not any different than keying their car. It's cowardly and childish.

&#x200B;

You don't know that person's situation or who depends on them. That person could be supporting children or a sick relative. And getting them fired will likely embitter them and reinforce their beliefs.

&#x200B;

There are obvious exceptions if there's implications for public safety or what not, but otherwise, if somebody can compartmentalize their behavior and be a good employee I really could not careless about what they do on their free time.

TIFU by joining my girlfriend's sister in the shower,"Long story short, my girlfriend (18) is getting her license next week so I have to pick her up to go to my house and drop her back off at her place (40 min round trip).

Last night I dropped her off at midnight and she wanted me to stay since I had work at 6AM and my workplace is down the street from her house.

My girlfriend and I regularly shower together at her house. She woke up and told me she was going to take a shower, and left the room, thinking I was going to sleep a little longer. To surprise her, I slyly walked into the bathroom and stripped naked. She was humming in the shower and I thought it'd be funny to scare her, so I opened the shower curtain, penor hanging loose, and yelled ""surprise!!!"" To my shock, it was her sister, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. I stood there for a second trying to process what was going on and just yelled sorry and ran out butt naked.

My girlfriend was in the kitchen and thought it was hilarious when I explained, but her sister and I haven't made eye contact since and haven't said a word to each other. Fml.

Update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met,"This is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

As a quick summary: I thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""Maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""Joe"" and his wife ""Kate."" After just a couple weeks, she was trusting Joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to Maggie's family Thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. I thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or Maggie had attachment issues.

I figured out what was going on and I feel like a huge idiot. I went to see Maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if I didn't like what I heard I'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue I couldn't handle.

I had the opportunity when I saw the gifts Maggie had gotten for Joe and Kate's kids. It seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

I asked Maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. Maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to Joe and Kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. Maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for Christmas.

I wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then Maggie said that she used to exchange Christmas gifts with Joe and Kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

I realized I was missing something important. If Maggie had other Christmases with Joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like I thought. I had thought that Maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but I didn't think Maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. I didn't want to ask, so I acted normally until I left.

When I got home, I went through Maggie's Facebook. She wasn't lying and she's not crazy. I found a ton of photos with Joe and Kate going back a decade. From what I can figure out, they all went to college together, Joe and Maggie were Big Brother and Little Sister in a coed frat/sorority, and Maggie and Kate were roommates. I also found pictures of Maggie as a bridesmaid in Joe and Kate wedding and pictures of Maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. All of Maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that I know all this.

I think this whole thing is my fault. I have ADHD and I don't handle it well. I've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where I start zoning them out. I've been called out for this before. I think it's pretty likely that Maggie did tell me about Joe and Kate and I just wasn't listening. Maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so I think it's more likely that I wasn't listening when Maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

This was a pretty big wakeup call for me. I've been ignoring my problem because I didn't want to face facts that it was serious but I know I need to do something before I make anymore mistakes. I'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",relationship_advice
A man's fence is broken and he neess to hire someone to fix it,"So he goes online to find someone to fix his fence for him but he is unsatisfied with their prices, that is until he finds a Buddhist monk who will do it for free.

He is initially surprised by this and assumes it might be a fake listing, but since it's free he feels like he has nothing to lose so he hires him.

Sure enough a few days later the monk shows up with a toolkit in hand, the man shows the monk that his fence has been ripped out of the ground and that he needs to replace it.

About an hour later the monk walks in and tells the man he is finished, and when the man goes outside he sees that the fence is perfect, thinking he can't just tell the monk to leave after doing such a great job for free he invites the monk inside for a cup of coffee.

The man then starts talking to the monk, ""It surprised me to see a monk offering services for fence repair, why do you do it?"" he asked

the monk replied ""Religious reasons.""

The man then says ""I don't know much about Buddhism, why do you need to repair fences?""

""Because"" the monk replied, ""You would be surprised at the amount of karma you get for reposting.""

Can I get a paternity test on myself?,"Hi, I'm 16 y/o and have good reason to think my mom and dad aren't my real parents. I had a much older sister who killed herself when I was 6. She was 26 when she died. All of her stuff is in the basement in boxes. I don't remember too much about her honestly and it makes me sad sometimes. My parents don't talk much about her. There's a painting in our house that she painted. It's a very nice painting of a swamp. It's my favorite thing. I decided to go looking through all of her stuff mostly for more pictures. What I found was a bunch of notebooks of writing she did mostly poetry. I felt weird reading them at first because they were mostly about her depression then I read this one that was about how she had a baby and someone took him away. It's really short and I didn't really understand it like a lot of it seemed metaphorical I guess is the word. Anyways I asked my mom if she ever had a baby and my mom was real weird about it she wanted to know why I would ask that. I said idk I just found some stuff in the basement and was curious.

Preheating the oven is a scam ran by the government to take your money,"Every fucking time I buy a frozen pizza, I put that sassy bitch in right when I start the oven. Why? Because I've figured it out. That's right Uncle Sam, I'm onto you. 

The directions for my favorite pizza is to heat the oven to 425F and cook for 15 minutes. My oven takes 14 minutes to preheat. So, this whole cooking process takes about 30 minutes? No way. Not chance in hell, buckaroo. When I shove my pizza in that oven prematurely, I add 3-4 minutes to compensate. This means I wait a total of 18-19 minutes vs 30. And guess what? It tastes fucking delicious. Ask any of my friends. I cook them frozen pizzas all the time, and they can't get enough, thanks to my unequivocal superior intelligence. The pizza turns out just fine, and it poses no health threat. Source: I've been doing this for 12 years.

My [22F] boyfriend of 3 years [23M] and I just had a huge fight over a tampon.,"Yes. You read that correctly. The subject matter is... a tampon. To preface, I took a plan B recently and with that comes your period. So today I woke up at about 7 AM as I began my menstrual cycle. Going to skip the TMI, and simply say I had to run immediately to our bathroom (located in our room). Unfortunately there were no tampons in our bathroom they were downstairs. I asked my bf to please go get me one from downstairs and he refused. Just a straight up ""no I'm sleeping and tired leave me alone"" I tried to explain to him that it was an emergency and I REALLY needed his help in that moment as I was essentially stuck on the toilet and he just replied with ""no use a towel or something and you go get it"". I started crying bc I'm a fairly emotional person and it really made me sad that he wouldn't help me when I REALLY needed it. He is the reason I currently got my period anyways (plan B). Well I guess my crying upset him even more so he got up and said I ""do too much"" and tried to slam the bathroom door so he could ignore me. In the process he clipped my legs and as a result turned my whole body which turned the toilet seat, essentially breaking it off. I know all of this sounds bad, typing it out really shows me how disturbing his reaction was. I guess I'm just trying to be level headed and see if there are any opposing perspectives. Was I being too dramatic or am I justified in wanting to break up over this? His reaction in general tells me that he does not know how to conduct himself maturely and respectfully. But to play the devil's advocate, he is a D1 college athlete so he is on a very tight schedule with long days resulting in him being tired most of the time. Sorry if this is rambling just looking for opinions before I move out and back home across the country. Bc if I decide that there is no coming back (my parents wouldn't let me lol).

Edit: he is home from practice. Not sorry. Not remorseful. Still blaming me for doing too much. I can't stop crying. I showed him all of your responses and he said you're all wrong and I'm stupid for taking advice from Reddit. I'm heartbroken.

Edit 2: I fuckin love reddit man. I'm sitting here crying but every response I read makes me feel a little stronger. I'm the biggest cry baby ever and I really thought I loved this guy. So naturally I'm super sad. But I need this. I needed to be shown that this isn't normal or ok. Thank you guys.

I [23F] caught my younger siblings having sex while my mom was away on a short vacation with my aunt.

I am working already, while my sister is in college and working part time, then my little brother is in his last year of high school.

My mom has a good job, earns a lot of money, and we works really hard. It's been years since she has really had a break and her boss told her to take a week off since she had paid for a week long trip to a resort that isn't very far.

I was about to freak out on them but then again it'a the two of them against me and I don't know if my mom would believe them and think I'm crazy or believe me so I just took it calm and tried to go to sleep.

TIFU by eating a girl out and getting sent to the emergency room.,"So this actually happened about 3 weeks ago. 

Rewind to a night of heavy drinking, rocking out, and sleeping with a coworker. She was exceptionally fine so I decided to end the foreplay with a little tongue action. Everything feels clean, no offensive smell or taste. We move onto the main course and I notice a more than offensive smell, Must've dug up something deep. So I finish her and end the night.

A day later and my throat is sore, but I think nothing of it as I was drinking and smoking heavily the night before. 

Two days later, my left tonsil is black, green, and white, swollen more than 2x it's size and hurts like a mf. I go down to the local med express to have it looked at and after about 35 mins I see the doctor. With a look of concern on his face, he tells me I need to go to the ER. 'The ER?' I asked 'is it really that bad?' The doc asks me how long it's been hurting and I told him I had just noticed it today. He tells me it's very Aggressive and spreading rapidly; it's beyond his treatment. So I head down to the ER to get asked more questions and wait to see another doctor. He finally comes in, looks at it and tells me they're going to have to drain my tonsil with a syringe (which didn't feel the best, by the way).

A script of painkillers, steroids for the swelling, amoxicillin, a few tears later and I'm all better.

tl;dr eating a girl out while she has a bacterial infection might land you in the ER for tonsilitis.

My husband constantly bodyshames me.,"I was around 5'1 and 100 lbs when we got married and six years later, I'm 5'1 and 125 lbs. He constantly comments on my body and my weight even though I've never asked for his opinion.  I know my body isn't perfect, but I'm working on accepting that. 

Actual things he has said to me

1. (A day after I gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - [*disgusted tone and expression*] ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" By the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

2. ""It's not baby weight when the baby is two years old.""

3. ""Your thighs are huge. When you sit down, they look even more enormous""

4. ""It's like you've lost the weight everywhere except for your hips. It's very noticeable from behind. I'll even take a photo and show you so you can see for yourself how fat your ass is""

5. ""I'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
Who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. He even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""Who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""Who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""Who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""Why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? You keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. So maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""Short and fat isn't a good combination""

And so on. On average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. I've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. It's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",relationship_advice

I (25 F) just found out my husband's (38 M) latest affair is a 19 year old girl.,"So maybe I don't need to worry about divorcing him after all, maybe she is wife #3 for him. 

He told me about her last night. He was home late and slightly drunk. But he knew what he was saying. I know he said it to hurt me. And it did even though I know hes been cheating before. 

Now I just need to plan my exit. I think my chances of finding another boyfriend or husband are slim to none  (I have no hair or breasts anymore from my cancer) but at least I will have my kids.

AITA for telling my morbidly obese 10 year old sister to eat healthier?,"So I'm 17 and I used to be morbidly obese. I was actually morbidly obese until last year when I decided to stop eating my parents food and make my own. I'm now at a normal healthy weight, going to the gym everyday and trying to build musey and I feel really great. I went from 130kg to 70kg and I'm 5ft 9

Anyways my sister eats horribly. She is morbidly obese. My parents always buy her huge bags of sweets (in which she eats all of it), she eats an entire pizza for dinner, eats a huge Doritos share bag all by herself, is practically allergic to water, burgers and oily drenched chips is a tradition in our house too 

Anyways I saw her eating 5 white bread grilled cheese sandwhiches fried in a pan filled with butter. The sandwhiches were practically soaked with oily butter and with 2 packets of crisps on the side. My mother made it for her. 5 sandwhiches. It's absolutely insane I think And there was nice coke can to go with it. I told my sister that she could at least substitute the coke for water and that the volume of food was too much. I offered her a Piece of tofu in which I was having for lunch. Tofu is actually delicious. More people should try it.

 She told my mother and my mother screamed at me and told me that I'm ruining her childhood and that nobody told me to eat healthy when I was a child(I wish someone did). Apparently eating junk and being huge is a good childhood. My mother said I wad being extremely offensive and that she might now not let me go off with my friends next week anymore for camping.

Divorce on table because husband and I cant agree on baby's name,"Hello reddit. This title might look funny but its an actual problem between me (23F) and my husband (24M). 
We've been dating for a year, been married for 2 years. I got pregnant like 7 months ago so recently we started discussing name for the baby. Ever since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name. Its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most. In the beginning of our relationship we had may problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. He really loved her and he never hid that from me but I thought it was over once she moved away. Now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and I can name the second child. When I asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didnt work out doesnt mean he doesnt want something to keep reminding him of her. He doesnt understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. 
Is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name OUR child like that.
Thank you! ",relationship_advice
TIFU by not wearing pants to a job interview,"This happened today, 8:30am.

I cannot even try to make an excuse for how I could have literally forgotten a vital piece of clothing.

I got pretty close. I donned my favourite opaque tights and chose my shirt then I proceeded to get distracted by some forms I had to complete online, ran short on time, put on my long winter parka and left the house.

I got up to the interview feeling very comfortable and fifteen minutes early. As the receptionist told me to go hang up my coat I gladly walked over to do so. I began to unzip my jacket, looked down and for a brief moment I thought my skirt had just ridden up on my commute. Nope, nothing there. Luckily I never fully took off my jacket.

I proceeded to turn on my heel and leave. I got downstairs but was still holding the coat hanger.

I didn't want to be a theif on top of just leaving abruptly. So I then took the elevator back up, claimed a family issue, and returned the coat hanger.

Silver living is they let me reschedule. So now I have an interview for later this afternoon. In about an hour.

TL;DR Left my house without any pants on for a job interview then absconded with company property

EDIT: I think the job interview went well. I appreciate everyone's encouragement, and also thank you for the silvers.

I'm also happy (?) that so many other people have gone to work in various states of undress.

And to the people who are/ are now afraid of coming to their work places 'naked': I'm sorry! This was also a latent fear of mine too, and the stuff of my nightmares. I can't believe it actually happened and that 'checking for pants' will now become part of my routine.",tifu
"I hate how reddit is becoming increasingly used by kids, especially those in middle school","Every time I talk about this in a thread i get bombarded with downvotes,so i think this is an unpopular opinion. I think theres way too many kids on Reddit. I remember when people at least pretended to be adults. Why cant we have that? From my experience, alot of these kids are immature, cringey, and boastful. When kids at least pretended that they were adults, the negatives werent as noticeable.  I hate every post that begins ( im 12 but) or whatever. l think kids need to at least try to hide the fact their a kid and not brag about how immature they are

EDIT: People have been saying I hate kids. This isnt the case. I just take issue when some kid mentions their age on the internet as if it furthers an argument or statement they are making. If your point is solid, it can stand up without mentioning ur age. No one asked for your age. There are a few times when one would talk about age on the internet, but kids simply do talk about age at appropriate areas/threads/whatever. Like ive seen 12 year olds on r/relationshipadvice. Let your actions define you. Ifind kids who mention age are either super serious like they are superior or super cringey. Just let your actions define you. Unless u try to act like an adult, people will still tell u are r/iamverysmart or a complete immature loser. ",unpopularopinion
TIFU by coming into work early to try and impress the boss.,"I work at a mid size company with around 30 employees, all the employees start at 7 AM with the exception of the Owner/boss and myself who prefer to start at 6. I have a project coming to a close and promised to have it ready for next Monday. I thought it was a good idea to come in a few hours early so 3:30 to get a head start and impress the boss. I show up right at 3:30. I unlocked the door and went to punch in my alarm code..... I completely forgot my code, I've entered it thousands of times and I just forgot. The alarm started going off and simultaneously the phone rang it was the alarm company calling for my code and I couldn't provide it. They ended up calling the owners home phone and he rushed over to turn off the alarm then of course got in an accident with an un-insured driver, had to pay everything out of pocket..... I also missed the deadline.

Tldr; went in early to impress the boss, set off the alarm, he came in to turn it off and got in an accident on the way, wasn't impressed.

Edit 1: I say ""Mid-size"" as it's Mid-size for our industry

TIFU by trying to inflate my penis like a dick balloon.,"This fuck up took place 15 years ago when I was around 11 years old.   I had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  It got me thinking about how small my penis was.    I decided I needed to do something about this.   I did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   

Now, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  I however knew that I had a penis, which had a hole, and I had a pump.   The pump I had, was a soccer ball pump.   The ones with the little metal needle.  Well I examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   I stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   I decided the pain would be worth it.   I pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   It inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   Since I was 11, I was not an anatomy expert.   The sensation gave me an erection, so I decided it must be working.  I inflated again.   It hurt a little this time, and now it felt like I had to pee.   I wanted results though, and people always say ""No pain, no game.""   I pushed the handle down again.   Now I really fucking had to pee.

I removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   The sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   However, I really fucking had to pee.   I pushed super hard.   No man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  I get to claim that I guess.   The air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   It really hurt my dickhole.   Amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    I can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   Check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.

15 years later it still hurts when I pee occasionally.  I am considering going to a urologist one day, however I am not sure how to address the issue.   The last thing I would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  

TLDR:   I thought my penis was too small so I inflated it like a balloon.    It hurt when I peed.

AITA for wanting my step dad to replace my laptop with a new ¬£2000 one?,"Throwaway because I have to use my brother's laptop after the incident.

I (18f) have just started university and after two years of saving up, I splurged on a ¬£2000 ($2600) HP Spectre with the highest specs. I treasured the laptop, it was my baby. I used it for all of my uni work, gaming, watching shows, everything really.

Now, my step dad is a horrible person. He's always complaining about what I spend my money on and spent all of my time working trying to get me to quit so I wouldn't be able to spend so much money. He's always had it in for my laptop and my phone that I paid a lot for.

I should also mention that I don't live with him, so what I spend my money on makes no difference to him.

Anyway, I've just come home for easter break and my step dad has destroyed my laptop. I don't know how this happened exactly, but he sat on it, put it on the floor when he realised, and then stood on it when he got up. I could tell by the smug look on his face that he meant to do it and he wasn't remorseful in the slightest. When my mum was out of the room, he's made it clear I deserved it and hasn't stopped joking about it. He's also 'jokingly' said my phone is next.

My mum has forced him to apologise and she also made him agree to buy me a new one, as hes literally destroyed this one beyond repair. I'm already super upset about losing my games (but thankfully my work was backed up).

However, he's saying he can't afford to replace the laptop over ¬£500. I understand that ¬£2000 is a lot of money, but he broke it on purpose, and I spent so long saving. I've made it clear that if he doesn't replace it with the same specs and nothing less I will be either pawning his television, watch, old laptops, whatever or going to the police. My whole family thinks this is awful of me as this would be extremely hard for my family.

So, I know I'm not the asshole for the broken laptop. But am I for accepting nothing less as a replacement?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I just want to say thank you guys so much for all the well wishes and advice. Let me clear a few things up as well:

\- unfortunately, the laptop is snapped in half by my whale of a step parent, so there's no chance of repairs

\- also, I know I'm not TA for asking for the replacement, I just know how much my family will struggle to pay me back this amount and my main concern is whether I'm wrong to do that to the rest of them :(",AmItheAsshole

LPT: Bring a 24-hour survival kit on even the shortest hike,"**TL;DR: Short hikes are dangerous because people go into them without gear and preparation to fall back on if things go bad. Make a 24-hour survival kit out of an old water bottle and always throw it into your backpack on even the shortest day-hikes.**

Short hikes are the most dangerous, for one simple reason: people underestimate them and thus go into them without gear and preparation to rely on if things go bad.

The recent (happy) story of a woman who was rescued after 17 days lost in the Hawaii jungle is illustrative of countless similar stories of even experienced hikers going on short, ""fun"" day hikes, getting turned around/injured, and then getting thoroughly lost - without the water, food, gear, maps, and preparation they'd have on a longer trail.

She survived, but she easily could have died. *On a 3-mile trail that she'd hiked before.*

I myself am a veteran hiker and backpacker. The only time I've ever gotten lost was on a ridiculously short and easy day hike. I got turned around, night fell, etc. etc. It really can happen to just about anyone. I got myself out, but it wasn't a sure thing.

And now, with the popularity of parks exploding, I see more and more people going onto trails absolutely unprepared for anything other than balmy, kind, daylight conditions. Thin cotton clothes, maybe one water bottle, flimsy urban footwear, no map/compass/understanding of the topography. If anything happens, these people are absolutely hooped.

So: never go unprepared. Get a wide-mouth Nalgene bottle and stuff it with some/all of the following (in generally descending order of importance). Just toss it into your day pack alongside your water and you'll at least have some basic essentials if things go bad.

The things I have in mine include:

\- Survival heating blanket

\- Plastic sheet to use as shelter

\- Whistle

\- Flashlight/headlamp, with extra batteries

\- Lighters/matches (don't melt the sheet/blanket, though!)

\- Critical meds and bandages

\- Zip ties (these things have countless uses)

\- Flagging tape (bright color - use it to mark your course so you can backtrack if unsure, and/or to alert rescuers)

\- Compass (if you're able to use it)

\- Paracord

\- Knife

\- Duct tape (same as zip ties - countless uses; you can just wrap a bunch around the water bottle and pull off as necessary)

\- Hand warmers if you're in temperate/colder areas, even in the summer (I always put this right at the top of my kit, so it's the first thing I can grab - when you're really cold, your hands can stop working, so you need to get them working to do anything else to save yourself - I've experienced this first-hand).

\- Iodine tabs for water

\- Beef jerky

\- Energy gel

**Edit:** Because it may be of interest: I just weighed it at 754 g - and that's with some additional stuff that I don't mention in the list. For reference, a liter of water (without a bottle) is 1 kg.

**Edit 2:** I wrote this for people who regularly go on short hikes without *any* first aid/survival stuff. The kit I describe is absolutely bare-bones and does not replace knowledge, preparation, and/or better gear. 

The kit I mention shouldn't give you any additional confidence and certainly shouldn't encourage additional risk-taking - it's a last-resort fallback that is better than nothing at all.

For people wanting to see the kit I made, or skeptical it can be done - just google Nalgene survival kit. Lots of people put a lot more time and thought into this than I have, and have kits that are a lot prettier than mine. 

Definitely tailor your kit to your area, too.

Finally: as always, the most important things to have are proper clothing, footwear, water, knowledge of the area, knowledge of what risks your area poses (e.g., hypothermia at night, heat stroke, etc), ability to read the weather, and the knowledge and skills to help yourself and others if things go bad. *This kit will not make up for deficits in those areas.*",LifeProTips
It's perfectly OK for a man to hit a woman back if she hit him first,"The most popular argument against this is that ""*men are stronger*"". Yes, but why pick a fight with someone far stronger than you? If I walk into a gym and punched the biggest guy there in the face, should I cry foul if he hits back?

Granted, I can't exactly call it self-defense. Chances are, a woman hitting a man isn't exactly a threat to his life. But it doesn't have to be. She is trying to cause him pain. He should have the right to cause her pain in return. I'm not saying he should go ape-shit on her and send her into a coma, but at the same time he should have the right hit her with the intention of causing her pain.

Far too often I see women hitting men *knowing* they won't hit back. This expectation that men won't hit back encourages women like this to be aggressive. Men don't pick fights with bigger men because they have a rational fear of the bigger guy hitting back. Too often, women use this expectation of chivalry as armor.",unpopularopinion

The last 48 hours have been a rollercoaster of emotions to say the least.¬† I kinda feel like I'm living in one of those crime novels. At one point, I seriously considered walking away from it all because there were enough things that took place to make me feel like it was a possibility I might find myself having some kind of ""accident"" in the near future. 

I obviously won't be able to share too many details...at least not yet...but I do want to let everyone know I have an attorney, as well as a private investigator who is a retired FBI agent with a LOT of connections. As of today, I have finally been able to locate my mother's body and it has not been cremated. I also have been granted access to her property.¬† A lot of things are missing.¬† The vehicle has been reported as stolen as well as a few other items... which I'm sure the list will grow as we continue to go through her belongings. 

Thank you to every single one of you who offered your help, resources, experiences, and condolences. I will never be able to express the amount of gratitude I have for your willingness to help a stranger you've never met. You guys are amazing!!

I'm not really sure what to make of all this and I could really use some insight on the matter. Evidently my mom passed away last Wednesday June 5th...I say evidently because my brother and I weren't notified until yesterday evening of her passing. 

I'm not entirely clear on the details because the circumstances are not adding up and I'm afraid if I try and explain the chain of events... it'll become extremely confusing but I feel like the manner in which this was handled seems fishy.¬† 

We first learned of the news from a friend of our mother's who says she recieved a phone call yesterday (4 days after my mother's passing) from someone claiming to be a sheriff of the county my mother resided in, informing her my mother had passed away and asked if she happened to have keys to my mother's house because they were trying to locate next of kin. (See...weird huh?) He claims he found her number by going through my mother's phone (which would've been with her in her house, where they found her so why do they need keys) She told them she did not have keys but they could try calling her children (me and my brother) or her brother (my uncle) and that our numbers should also be in the same phone. 

My mother's friend calls me to ask what was going on and did something happen to my mom and while I'm talking to her, my uncle calls me... which is odd because I haven't spoken to him in over 10 years and I wasn't even aware he had my number. He immediately goes into this whole story about how my mom passed away last Wednesday of a massive heart attack in her home and the police from her town contacted him after they were sent to her house to do a welfare check and found her. They supposedly went through her phone and saw he was the last person she talked to so they contacted him first. Then without skipping a beat or even giving me a chance to process all of this,¬† he goes on to tell me that my mother had informed him on multiple occasions that she was leaving everything to him and that he was to make sure my brother and I, were to receive none her belongings and he kept mentioning his good friend Sheriff Whats-his-nuts ( fake name for obvious reasons) and HIS attorney have both informed him he was not to contact my brother or me about the situation and that since my mother left him everything, he needed to remove what he wanted from her home and donate the rest to Salvation Army. He was making arrangements to have her cremated and would let me know if he decides to do a funeral... then he hung up.

How is that even possible? Can he do that? I mean even if by some crazy off the wall chance my mother lost her mind and created a legal living will that named her brother... who's almost 15 years older than my mother by the way... the executor of her will and she left everything she owns to him...is there not some kind of reading of the will my brother and I are required to attend? Is this how this stuff goes down? I really can't be involved in making funeral arrangements for my own mother? Never once had our mother ever mentioned she had a will and I can not fathom her leaving everything to my uncle. But my feelings aside what is the legal process here? How could I find out for certain if there even is a will? 

The situation gets a little crazier because after I called my brother, he calls my uncle and is told the same thing... they argue a little over the phone and it's now turned into my brother and I are allowed to accompany my uncle to my mother's house, and ""rummage through what's left to see if there's anything we want"" but it has to be this coming Wednesday because he has meetings all day Tuesday (today) with a probate attorney to iron out the details of my mother's estate. To my knowledge he's already taken her dog and her brand new car, into his possession. 

This makes me think there is no will. If there was a will like he originally claimed, and my brother and I were to receive nothing... how are we all of the sudden allowed to look through what's left?

I'm extremely uncomfortable with this situation. 

The most disturbing part of this whole ordeal is, I know my mother was working on the legal details of an invention she recently had patented and was in the process of interviewing manufacturers to fabricate her invention.¬† She reviewed all the legal paperwork with my brother and me a few months ago...I'm worried that's why my uncle is in such a hurry to hire a probate attorney, and throw names of law enforcement friends of his (he himself is a retired police officer) which would also explain why it took him 4 days to notify my brother and me about her passing. 

Isn't there some kind of chain of command that has to be followed when it comes to notifying next of kin? Is there a certain legal process that needs to happen when a person has a will?? Or even if they don't?? Sorry for the long post. I'm still trying to understand all of this. It just doesn't seem to make any sense. Who should I contact first? The police in her area? An attorney? What do I do?

Update: I can't respond to anyone now that its been locked but to answer a few questions. No I haven't seen the body though my own eyes and neither has my brother. He and I are getting together today to get a lawyer. This is in fact very real and I'm not making it up at all. I created a new account in hopes of not being recognized as this is turning into a very tricky situation. My brother and I are both very overwhelmed at the moment and we're in a bit if a situation where we aren't exactly sure who we can trust.  As far as my  motive behind mentioning my mother's invention...evidently that was precieved as making this entire thing seem like a made up story. All I can tell you is, sorry I didn't disclose that in a manner which made it more believable for you. I guess I'm poorly communicating the events i've been through recently and to be honest, I'm trying more so to get actual advice, not to make sure you believe me.",legaladvice
AITA for not picking my girlfriend up for a birthday meal and telling everyone she is probably asleep because she ignored my text,"Unfortunately my girlfriend's social skills aren't excellent and as a result whenever she is annoyed at me she is totally incapable of expressing why she is annoyed, so she resorts to totally ignoring me.

Yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend. In the morning I sent her a few messages saying ""what time should I pick you up"" and such, all of which went ignored. I decided to just pretend that she was asleep and I went without her. When I arrived I just made a joke saying ""I think she's still asleep"", she hasn't replied to any of my messages. At about 12:45 I got a string of messages asking where I was and what's going on.

I knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but I didn't want to play this stupid game and I don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so I just decided to not pick her up.

TIFU by playing a Jackbox game with my girlfriend's family,"A little background: my girlfriend's family is extremely conservative. Like goes-to-church-twice-every-Sunday-and-never-swears conservative. While they are really nice people, it's a challenge for my heathen self to successfully endure a whole weekend with them without saying something that brings shame to my name. Onward...

So earlier tonight, my girlfriend's family decided to play some games together. We settled on Drawful (a game that allows you to draw things from your phone). This is where things go south... 

After choosing our character names, you have to draw your character. Seems cool, right? However, this is my first time playing and everyone failed to mention that once you start drawing, YOU CAN'T ERASE. So being the funny guy I am, I draw this huge, veiny dick and secretly show it to my girlfriend in front of me. We have a good laugh because we both knew damn well that her family would be mortified if it showed up on the screen. As a joke, my girlfriend pretends to hit ""submit,"" on my phone. In reality, she REALLY DID HIT SUBMIT. Next thing I know, my character name pops up on the tv with a huge, contoured schlong. There was no mistaking this beauty, either. I feel my heart skip a beat. I looked around and accidentally make eye contact with her 12-year-old sister, who looks at me with a disappointment unmatched by anything I've experience before.

I panic. I try to exit out of the game, but my Dick-asso masterpiece remains in the center of the screen. I stare at my phone to avoid the look from her parents. I try to pretend that I have no idea what happened. 

The game starts and every round, without fail, my pork sword drawing makes it way around the screen. I don't say a single word. The room is uncomfortably silent. I hear the occasional giggle from my girlfriend, and I'm doing my best not to explode inside.

The game FINALLY ends after what feels like a year. I select the new character screen and her dad says, ""What? You don't want to keep your big penis on there? Jesus would be so proud on this Easter weekend.""

Safe to say my girlfriend (more her family) isn't the one for me. 

TL;DR: I played Jackbox's Drawful with my girlfriend's family. I joking drew a huge dick as my character and my girlfriend accidentally submitted it. So there I was on the tv, identifiable as a veiny dick in front my girlfriend's sheltered, conservative family...

[Update] [Iowa] City threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors,"This is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

Hello r/legaladvice,

A few months ago I posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town I live in sent a letter demanding that I take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. Most of the comments I received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my First Amendment rights, and yes, I should seek a lawyer. 

So I did so. I set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. However, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended I speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

Skipping over unnecessary details, I met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. I updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". üòâ

Once I updated the website and the city realized I wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. I went, although now I realize I probably should not have done so. He was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought I should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. He also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think I should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. I declined the interview, because I was afraid I'd get sued (whether justified or not) if I said something the city didn't like.

Of course, I was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. So she ran her story, and I was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. What's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. They were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

A few weeks later I received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. It was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several Iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. He told me I was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. The letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

This was around mid-January, 2018 (I received the first letter mid-December, 2017). Everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until I got an email from the legal director at the ACLU of Iowa. On the advice of Reddit, I had emailed both the ACLU and the EFF, but after over a month with no response I had figured they were too busy to look at my case. I was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

I spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the ACLU of Iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. Toward the end of February we filed suit in Federal court, and by March 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. They had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content I produce regarding the town.
2. They must pay legal damages to me.
3. They must pay attorney fees to the ACLU.
4. They must write an apology letter to me.
5. My favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take First Amendment training.

All in all, I'm incredibly impressed with the ACLU's work on this case. I know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but I think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. I'm super grateful to the ACLU for helping me with this, because as I said above, I wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. I'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the ACLU -- thank you for all of the help!",legaladvice

"TIFU when my best mate changed his name in my phone to ""sexy jess from work""","So several years ago my best mate todd changed his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" and then would ring my phone in the middle of the niggt to try and get me in trouble with my partner. But she was friends with him before we had even gotten together so she recognized his number and his prank didnt really  work out.

Fast forward 6 or 7 years to the weekend just passed.
Im sitting on the couch watching tv and my partner is upstairs my 8 year old daughter is bored so i give her my phone to play a game on.

Que fuck up.
I never changed todds name back. Its been a running joke between us for years.
So ""sexy jess from work"" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. She freaks out. Comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams ""i hate you dad!"". She runs off upstairs.
So im sitting there really confused. After a few seconds i follow her upstairs. I can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.
Now im really confused. I get to the bedroom. My partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from ""sexy jess from work"". I piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.

Tldr : buddy saved his name in my phone too ""sexy jess from work"" several years ago as a joke. Today my daughter sees it freaks out and thinks im cheating on hwr mother.

Sorry for formatting on mobile.


Edit. Wow this blew up.

So yes my daughter threw my phone at me. Then picked it up and took it with her upstairs.

Im Australian. My daughter is in grade 4 and is quite intelligent. Yes she knows what sexy is and yes she knows what cheating is.

I (17f) went to my school counselor about all the nasty stuff my stepfather (50m) does. It's caused chaos at home,"
My mom and dad divorced a few years ago, and now my mom is dating Zach. It was really stressful when he moved into the house with us, he's bossy and gets pissed off easy.

I started keeping a diary to vent, and every day I'd write in it and talk about what was going on in my life. It helped me cool down and relax when I was upset.

A few weeks ago, stuff got really stressful at home and I decided to put together a list of stuff that upset me and go to the school counselor for advice. I wasn't expecting her to get very involved, I just wanted to talk to someone. My best friend has talked to her about coping with her mom's death and she said she was very kind and helpful.

So i went to the counselor and I'd made a list of the things that Zach did that made me angry, because I wanted to be prepared to talk. I tend to clam up if I have to talk about personal things, and I didn't want that to happen.

So I brought this list that I'll copy here:

- Zach yells easily if he doesn't get his way. At me, at other people like the Applebee's waitress, the cashier at the Walmart, etc.

- Zach is big on ""making up"" even when I'm not ready; he will make me hug him even if I'm still mad, because he's over being mad and wants to make things better.. even though it doesn't work that way

- Zach doesn't respect my privacy, he want though my drawers and got mad because I had panties that he thought were ""too sl*tty"". I've got to hide my diary outside the house because I don't trust him to not read it.

- Zach is judgemental of my friends, how much money their families have or don't have. He says mean stuff about their families, like how (name's) momma is on meth

- Zach tried to go though my phone, look at personal texts with a boy I was dating, but luckily my phone was at 1 percent and died and i hid my charger

- Zach is an aggressive driver and I won't go in his car

Anyway, I told my school counselor all of that and i could tell she was very concerned. She asked about my diary, and I said I had more detail about all of this in my diary, I'd show her those pages if she wanted.

Showing her the diary was easier than talking for me. So i was happy to.

And after that, things went down hill. It seems like the councilor has the impression stuff is sexually motivated, but that's not how it is. And she's filed a report with cps, she said she had no choice because that's a law.

When I was at home and Zach was yelling at me about something, I let it slip what I'd done. I told him to shut up because CPS was coming soon and he shouldn't be adding to the list of nasty stuff he'd said.

He got even madder and is planning on going to the school today to confront the principal. I'm not sure what will happen. Plus there's still the thing that the councilor seemed to misinterpret.. what can I do?

TLDR - I am rely stressed after talking to s school councilor about my step dad. They made a cps report and i think they're assuming things are worse than they are",relationship_advice
"Just because I'm a male, doesn't mean that my problems are invalid or any less important.","Yes there are many men who are rich and in power. Yes Forbes lists and company executives are dominate by men. I get it. Guess what, me and everyone else reading this is likely not a part of that elite.

When's the last time you heard of a widely available support network for men? Higher suicide rates, higher incarceration rates, un-realistic expectations. Innocent guys getting punished with heavy sentences for false rape claims. Guys being told to 'man-up' when they dare complain about anything. Prostate cancer rates higher than breast cancer, with a fraction of the non-for-profits that are specialized for it. 

It's tough out there. There are people out there that are doing great work for men, great advice and great support. I'm very thankful for these people and organisations.

And make no mistake, this isn't throwing blame, or taking away from other worthy causes. Domestic violence is real and prevalent, rape is despicable and ever present.

"Teenagers are old enough to understand the consequences of their actions and cannot be excused from being responsible for them because ""their brain isn't fully developed.""","Recently, I was reading the comments (on Reddit) for an article about the sentencing of a teenager for dropping rocks onto a highway from an overpass. I noticed that some people said that, since the accused were only teenagers, their impulse control areas of their brains hasn't fully developed yet and so they couldn't be held completely responsible for the death of the man who was struck by a rock they dropped (or something similar to those words.)

I come from a country with a very strong family identity, so to imagine a wayward teenager simply ending another person's life doing something clearly and obviously dangerous is inexcusable. It is very easy to see that dropping rocks of an overpass onto oncoming traffic could easily lead to a loss of life, and so a teenager cannot be excused from their actions simply by stating that they are not mature enough or they cannot foresee the consequences of their actions, because, as I have said earlier, it is plain to anybody with an ounce of common sense that doing so can kill someone, a fact most likely obvious to the teenagers who did it (and who probably did it because this could happen.)

Edit: to all those saying that teenagers' brains are not yet fully developed and so cannot judge the consequences of their actions, my response to you is this: would you say the same for a 14-year-old who murders or rapes someone? By that age, all children should clearly know what is right and what is wrong especially in terms of actions that can hurt or kill others or themselves.

Edit 2: What I'm trying to say is that teenagers know what is right and wrong and know that doing certain things could seriously hurt or kill others or themselves. If they decide to do these things regardless, they should be punished in a way that reflects their intentions.",unpopularopinion
AITA for objecting to 'girls day'?,"I'm a 28 y/o male and my immediate family is all women, mostly this is because I was raised by my mother and have no contact with my father's side of the family due to a messy divorce when I was young. My two sisters (early 30s), my three aunts (two who are my mother's sisters and one married in to the family and married my aunt), and they have an assortment of close friends of the family all of which are women that also go to these events. 


About 3 years ago, my mother had an idea to do a 'girls only' weekend. Originally this was to see one of the Magic Mike movies, and because it was such a hit they started to do these weekend outings once or twice a month. Originally it didn't bother me, because I'm an adult and I have my own life, and my own house, and I really didn't even think about it. But an incident recently made me annoyed at the whole concept. My aunt's birthday was in January and normally we go to her favorite restaurant for her birthday, which also incidentally is my favorite restaurant. So I bought her a present and a card, and waited for an invitation and none came. 


When I asked what was going on for her birthday, I was told they celebrated it early on their girls day because she was going to be out of state during her birthday. This kind of irked me because when I mentioned I bought her a present my mother told me to just drive over to her house and give it to her. I felt pretty left out since I am the only male in my immediately family, having a 'girls day' is the equivalent to saying 'hey let's celebrate my birthday but not invite him'. 


I griped about and was told that I was basically being self centered and that she can celebrate her birthday however she wants. I agree with that, but once again, I'm the only one being left out and it feels shitty. The proverbial straw that broke the camel's back was I was just also just informed that they were planning a summer vacation this year as 'girls only' too, and when I asked my mother what about the vacation we normally take as a family, she told me that they can't afford to do both so they are just doing the girls only vacation this year. 

At this point I was VERY annoyed and had a loud argument with my mother and sister, telling them that it's really shitty that twice a month they have group activities and specifically exclude me, and on top of that are now even taking vacations and excluding me. Nothing came of the argument and they wouldn't budge, so I decided I needed a break from my immediate family because they don't consider my feelings relevant. So I removed myself from the family group chat and deactivated my Facebook. Now my phone is being blown up and I'm being told that I'm immature and I need to grow up. I responded that a lot of grown people don't see much of their family at all and I'm just going to follow that example.

(update) I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a492j5/i_28m_with_fiance_27f_about_a_month_ago_overheard/

It all came to a head last night.  She just came out and asked me if I did not love her anymore and all that I could tell her was that a very large part of me still did but that what she said had really made it so that another part of me just didn't anymore.  

This started a larger conversation that I won't bore you with but ultimately it came down to me saying that I would have heard that he was just better at something or more attentive to something or was able to do something that I would have felt like I could have worked on it.  I would have listened to anything she wanted worked on any technique or anything else that she would have shared with me.  But to know that I was never going to measure up simply because of a physical issue was not something I thought I could get over any time soon or if I ever could for that matter.

I was even honest and said that if it was just a ONS she had or some random guy who was just huge I might be able to get past that.  But knowing that it was a guy who she was still madly in love with when I met her and only after time did she ever start to come around then it was just more than I could handle.

She kept trying to tell me how much better I was at everything else and that I should not throw away a lifetime over one aspect.  I told her that that one aspect sadly was just to high for me, not all things are equal and that honestly it is a mental failing on my part that it is but whether it is genetics or a learned trait or whatever that yes I needed to be my spouses best and she has already made it clear that I can never be.

I tried my best to be gentle, I tried to take all of the blame of stating that I knew that my attitude was probably not healthy but it was who I am.  

BTW I'm typing this as though this were a clean conversation, it wasn't, there was lots of crying (by both of us).

This is not a happy ending or even a satisfying one.  I am beyond fucked up in the head over the entire situation.  Everybody's Christmas is ruined.  We had big family gatherings that we both were attending together and now we have to somehow break it to our family's what has happened.  

This alone is causing me massive stress because my parents loved her and what in the hell am I going to say is the reason why we are not together?  She didn't cheat and if I say that I felt like she was still hung up on her ex she will obviously deny it and she will tell them the truth.  It's fucked up no matter how this goes down.

In the end I feel like a massive failure.  I feel like a failure as a man because of not living up to comparison and I feel like a failure because I wasn't able to just ""man up"" and either get over it.

She has begged me to go to couples counseling and initially I said no because at the end of the day what does it change?  We can talk about every single thing and I can try and look at things from a different way and at the end of the day the woman who I wanted to marry just told one of our friends that no matter what I do I will never be as good as her ex.  I just can not see five years from now ever being okay with this.  

But because she legitimately seems heartbroken I agreed to go.  But that does  not mean I will keep going.  

Today I moved out a lot of my stuff and am staying with a co worker for a few days until I can get a place for myself.  She has been with her sister all day.  

I feel like shit.  

Thank you to everyone who took the time to type out a response.  I honestly have tried to read everything even if I didn't reply to very many.

The bitch of all of this is that I still love her.  There is so much of me right now that wants to pick up the phone and call her and beg her to come back.

EDIT:  Well once again I posted this and then went away for awhile.  I went with my friend to see Mortal Engines and the to dinner and then we've been talking for a long while so I started reading awhile ago.  It is going to take me forever to read and once again I don't think responding individually will ever happen because of the large number of posts and private messages.  But thank all of you for reading and responding.

EDIT 2:  I guess I do want to share one thing I spoke with her about.  When we were having our very long conversation I presented her with a scenario for her to compare.  I know her well enough to know that comparing body parts or sexual prowess isn't going to impact her the same way it would me.  So I put the scenario to her like this.  I said what if you walked in and overheard me talking with my friend Tim and you heard this.  ""Jill is great but she will never understand me and comfort me the way Tiffany did""  ""But its not Jill's fault Tiffany is just the smartest most compassionate person I've ever known and Jill just isn't as smart"".  Then if she would confront me about saying those things about her that my response to her would have been.  ""I love you for all of your other qualities"".  ""Nobody makes a sandwich like you do and I think long term you wont gauge me for my money""
At first she tried to say that this was a totally different issue but once we talked more about it she finally agreed it is because of the way we both approach and value sex.   She ultimately admitted that this would really hurt her feelings but she would not break up with me over it.  I then responded that even in my make believe scenario, which btw I would never say to anyone out loud about anyone I loved, she could improve her level of education and learn to be more compassionate.   
EDIT 3:  If anyone even reads this I want to add one last thing.  People have been telling me what a whiny bitch I am (that's one of the more kind things they've said) because I can't get over someone else in the world having a bigger dick than me.  Not going to lie and say I'm thrilled with it but I'm not dumb enough to think I have a giant magic wand or anything.  I had grown up believing what I now know to be a lie that women don't care about size.  Some don't but obviously some do and my ex is one of those that obviously did.  But even with that ultimately I might have been able to get over it if it was just said as a matter of fact.  But hearing that no matter what I did, how much I loved her or any other thing that I was NEVER going to be as good is what has bothered me since.  Yes size is obviously a big part of it, but if I hadn't heard that I would never be the lover I think I might have been okay.  Well not okay but at least not relationship killing.  Yes I overvalue sex.  I get that.  Yes it is very important to me and well frankly I want to be wanted as much as I want to want someone, if that makes any sense.  Yes I know whoever I date in the future will most likely have had someone who was either bigger, better or whatever.  But I would really hope that they would not be still hung up on it a few years later. ",relationship_advice

AITA for making a baby cry to save $100?,"Okay hear me out.

So today I took my baby over to my parents' house for dinner, without my wife. We have a five month old, she's home with the kid all day while I'm at work and needed a break‚Äîso I went with the baby. Works out well for everyone because she can nap, my parents get to spend time with their granddaughter, and I bring her home a doggie bag with dinner.

On the way home, around 10pm, I made a left in a no left. It saves me about 10 minutes because otherwise you have to go all the way around this huge park and then there are a bunch of one-way streets. It's a no left there because in rush hour it gets clogged up, but this was late at night and the street was pretty quiet: turning left did not worsen traffic or put anyone in any danger.

Of course there is a cop lurking and waiting, and I get pulled over. Here in Ontario, 'disobey a sign' is a $100 fine and 2 demerits (guess how I know‚Ä¶).

Baby was sleeping in her car seat in the back. So just as the cop was about to leave her car to walk up to mine, I just for a second turned the radio on fairly loud and on a static channel. Baby woke up and starting screaming. When I rolled down the window, the cop heard a screaming baby and sent me on my way.

Baby was perfectly fine. I gave her the pacifier and as soon as the car started moving she fell back asleep. We're home now and she's asleep and perfectly fine in her crib. I felt kind of guilty about the whole situation so I moved $100 (what I would have paid for the ticket) into the kid's RESP (university fund).

'My wife was absolutely furious when she found out' is what I might say if I was a complete idiot and had told her.

TIFU by climbing 999 steps with empty pockets.,"Quick disclaimer: This was a year ago.

I'm a huge history nerd and I absolutely love exploring ancient sites. My mother and I took a trip to Greece and were on a tourbus.

One of our many stops were Nafplio (which was absolutely beautiful) and our tour guide said ""If you climb 999 steps, you'll find the beautiful fortress of Paladimi. The entire bus chuckled (Mainly middle aged, few elders.) But being the teenage self I am, I was determined to climb those steps.

There's a slight problem however, I was really out of shape.

I am at the beginning of the staircase up the mountain and my mom (bless her heart) offered to take my wallet and the hotel keys so it wouldn't weigh me down. Left me with just my phone. She decided she didn't want to join me on my hike up the mountain because (understandably) she was worn out.

I begin my ascent, around 15-30 excruciatingly painful minutes later, i make it to the top. I had a sense of pride as I stepped to the entrance of the gate. I would be able to see a part of Greece that the rest of my tour bus wasn't able to see. I would have stories to tell at the dinner table. I would have amazing pictures.

Suddenly, right at the door I see a sign.

""8 Euros for admission"" 

and with that, I took my walk of defeat back down the 999 steps. 

TL;DR

I left my wallet and climbed a mountain to see a historical site, only for there to be an admission fee.

I was already well established and had made a significant amount of money working as a quant and investing my savings diligently. She on the other hand had never gone to college and was content working for basically minimum wage. 

So when I meet her we click instantly and I fall head over heels for her. We get married and move in together, and soon after have three kids. When we were expecting our first born she had told me she wanted to be a stay at home mom. Obviously I was jealous but I went along with it since it seemed logical.

So she spends the next 20+ years as a stay at home mom taking care of our kids while I work 12 hour days and then some. I'm not demeaning stay at home moms by the way, but in the context of our marriage she had an extremely easy going life style.

A couple years ago I discovered she had been cheating on me with her friend's husband. Divorced obviously followed.

The only major asset we had in the US was our house, which was a premarital asset. We had a shared bank account, but since I am a finance guy I handled all our investments, and for tax reasons invested it abroad in my home country. 

Now if we had just grown apart, or she said she was unhappy, I'd have no problem paying what's fair. But the fact she cheated on me is what makes me resent paying her a cent. 

So in the divorce she is awarded half of our investments made during marriage, >90% of which are abroad in my name, along with alimony for 20 years for 30% of my pay.

So here I am given an opportunity to get out of this entirely by moving back to my home country and never looking back. So I sell our house as fast as possible, move the money abroad, and move back to my home country while stringing her along about why it's taking so long to liquidate our savings. Once abroad I immediately stop alimony payments.

Now she has no legal recourse (I've double checked with lawyers) and is left with her share of the small amount we had in the states.

The reason I'm asking here is that my own children are split on this. My son is on my side 100%, while my daughters are 90% on their mothers side. I figured it would be interesting to see the opinions of people here.",AmItheAsshole
** Update **I (24m) was technically raped by a girl (23f) and now she's becoming friends with my friends,"Original Post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bofs9f/i_24m_was_technically_raped_by_a_girl_23f_and_now/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

So it's been about a week since things happened with finding my friends with the girl who raped me. Many of you helped me understand that and I took everyone's advice and recently started seeing a therapist to help, ty. 

To the people who said I deserved it or who were gatekeeping being a rape victim, I wish that you never go through what I've been dealing with. Even if you're cruel you don't deserve what I've been feeling.

So I met my friends two days later. The were calling me, asking to see me. I had taken two days off sick because I just had a mental breakdown. I couldn't really function. Next thing I know, I'm laying in my bed and I hear a knock on my door. When I went and opened it, it was Friends A, B, and C. They came to check on me. I let them in and they demanded I told them what was going on. 

We sat on my couch and for a moment I was silent. But friend A nudged me, and I came clean. I told him how she and I had been hanging out together, how we had been drinking and I let her stay at my place to sober up, and when I said no to sex, I woke up to her riding me. 

I then explained how to try and gain control, the day after, she asked to have sex and I said yes, but what I hadn't mentioned in my post was that I couldn't get it up, I felt too horrifically gross with her, and that I instead locked myself in my restroom. Saying that I was having the runs and got a Lyft for her home. I cried hard. I told them how when I saw her how my stomach lurched and how I felt like yelling and so angry. How awful I felt and that's why I left, then I told them how my family had blamed me and called me a pussy for not wanting sex. 

I just vented it all in tears, and when I couldn't choke back sobbing friend A hugged me. It had been months since I had touched someone else, I couldn't bring myself to for some reason, but hugging him felt right and that's when I realized he and Friends B and C were crying too.

For a moment things were weepy and Friend B and C hugged me with A and just said soothing things to calm me down. They made jokes, I laughed and said sorry to them. Then then told me how the night went.

So the night they hung out, and I left immediately. friend A, Friend B and C questioned R (Girl who raped me). She said that we had just had a negative experience on a date and that she didn't know why I would be upset. That it probably wasn't even about her. Issue is Friend A had seen how I was looking at her and felt weary, but apparently she's was a new coworker of his at the restaurant he works at and she had wanted to hang with him and he said yes. 

So when they start drinking and Catching up on Game of Thrones (intended thing to do that night), they watched her pop some pills and start chugging down her beers, which were red flags immediately to my guys because she admitted herself she didn't know exactly what she was taking, and tried to get really intimate with friend A. So thing is Friend A is in a relationship so he tells her no, yet she still tries to cuddle him and stuff, though he doesn't want that. 

So the episodes end and she's too out of it to drive and says she doesn't have the money for a Lyft. Thing is my friends have been drinking so they can't drive either so then she asks if they can let her sleep here for the night. They all agree and after B and C leave it's just A, making the couch for her to sleep.

That's when she asks to sleep with him, and he says no. So she tries again, and he refuses. So now A is pissed off, so he tells her once he's taken a nap he's taking her ass home. So he goes to his room, leaving her. He then tries to take a nap only to wake up to find R trying to get in his bed naked, and he flips. 

He was furious and called B and C, and they kicked her out of the apartment with most her clothes in hand. He then notified their boss in the morning and she was fired from her job for drug abuse. That's not the end though,

She went to the police the day after they kicked her out, and she actually filed a false rape claim against friend A, Issue is when police came to question him luckily he had a camera for his room since he's always been paranoid, and now I know why. Police came and he showed them the video evidence that vindicated him immediately. So now she's facing some severe penalties and issues over what she did. False police report and whatnot. 

They asked me to bring up what she did to me with the police. But honestly I don't know if I can or if bringing up something I can't prove like my friend is even worth it. What I do know is at the moment I haven't lost my friends, and I honestly don't care what happens to her. I just want to get over this. So I'll continue to go to therapy, and my friends will support me, and I'll support them. For once I don't feel like my name on here is as accurate anymore.",relationship_advice

This means that 7% of 50 is also equal to 3.5.","More examples: If you want to find out what 2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll get 0.4. So, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4.

"My(25M) Girlfriend(22F) wants to share our incomes, thing is, I make roughly 7 times as much, advice please","So here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. My girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, I finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company I did my internship at and within a year I got a promotion and a large payraise and I am now making roughly 150K a year, while she makes 20K a year.

Now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place I bought so I pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, Phone bill, netflix and so forth.

Now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently I pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

Now she seems to be jealous I got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs I put the majority in my savings account.

In my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

So what do I do, I hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if I am honest I am questioning my relationship as there is no way I am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

TIFU by making a girl I like laugh so hard she ended up in hospital and I almost lost my job.,"So there's this girl I like at work, and we're really good friends. We're having lunch and we're making those ironic depression meme jokes as most friends do. For some reason I (in my unknowingly- stupid way to get her laugh) got the idea to say ""Well hey, you know what's just one letter away from sad? DAB!"" and promptly did the deed. Also I have ability to cry on demand so I just stared stone-cold her and let two tears fall down.

She finds it funny. Extremely funny. So funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. After a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. I asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. Freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, I start to reach for my phone.

And in the exact second, my manager randomly decides to come in and sees this big guy towering over this poor little girl on the floor. I only manage to cut off her impending rage by saying I think she's having a seizure and I'm calling 911. Fortunately, I was able to explain to her what happened after the ambulance came.

Turns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. Whoops.

TL;DR. Made I joke with a girl that ended causing a asthma flare-up, manager walked in when it happened. She ended up in the hospital and I almost lost my job.

I am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I was super stoked to finally see them in Edinburgh! Most bands play in Glasgow so I couldnt believe my luck when I saw they were playing in my city!

So we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then I heard some bagpipe music was playing.

I thought hmm interesting...not what I expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in Scotland and the capital city I really did not think it was anything out of the usual.

About an hour in I was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but I was waiting for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to come out so I could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!

"[CA] I want to divorce my wife of 6 years, who has been a Jehovah's Witness for the last 4 years because of the extreme teachings of the cult, and how it could affect our children (3,1).","So I started looking deeper into all of this amidst my wife and I's simultaneous suspicions that her mentors within her church were ""poisoning us.""  They would bring us food all the time over a couple month period, and we were constantly sick.  Since cutting those people out we have been better.  I want to the hospital to have us all screened, but they referred us to a social worker, who is talking with police on the matter.   

This is when I started looking deeper into this ""religion.""  Long story short, I want as far away as I can from this stuff as well as my children.  I'm a military veteran who is 29, and has supported my family entirely up until now.  I have only been out of the military for a a little over a year now, and have bad anxiety and ptsd issues that have made attaining a job hard, so I'm living off my GI bill through the military (monthly check to supplement education post military -36 months), and military disability.  My spouse is hesitant to work, because the people in her religion tell her a wife should be at home.  

I thought I was being a supportive husband by supporting her choice of religion, but now that I've learned more, I can't.  I've tried to talk calmly about this to her many times, but it goes nowhere.  The religion is designed to warn her about people like me, ""worldly"" people.   She goes on talking about ""the end"" all the time like she is anticipating it.  I hate to say it, but I fear the brainwashing has potentially dulled her sense of reality.   Even after knowing these people could have poisoned her own children, she defends the organization as a whole.  She doesn't want to go to any conventional counseling because ""other people don't need to know our problems.""  I have no idea what do to at this point.

I probably will be supporting our family by my previously mention means while I try to get mentally stable again to work full time over the next couple of years.  I only have about $15,000 in savings, and I own our only vehicle, a fully paid off car.  We have furniture and stuff but I'm not attached to any of it.  I have a life insurance policy that was converted from my military SGLI to a VGLI and that's it for assets.   Other than that, no big debts or anything.   

Over the last 4 years, this is kind of how the split has been raising the kids:

2016,17:  I was in the military, my wife would handle the morning routine with the kids because I left early in the morning and got home in the afternoon, and would play with the kids and help with everything like cleaning, brushing teeth, putting to bed etc.  The only thing I didn't do much was cook, which I only did maybe once a week.  



2018,2019 (post military):  I spent 2018 looking for and working several different jobs that didn't last long, mostly in part to stress and adjustment disorder, and as a result only worked about 5 months last year, which ate into savings. Besides that, we have done everything in terms of taking care and spending time with the kids kids equal.

As I right this, I hide my children's Easter eggs alone in the backyard, as my wife will stay in the bedroom today because of the ""holiday"" she is not allowed to celebrate.   The psychological effect of never having their mom around for birthdays and holidays is only going to get worse, and it's hard on me to have to see them do it alone. What kind of parent doesn't want to have fun with their children smh.   

What is a divorce going to look like with her? I really just don't want to give up my disability pay for life or my gi bill payments for school.  Furniture, car, belongings can be split idgaf.  I don't want to pay her long term.

Edit: omg I cant believe this took off. I'm literally crying.  People are sending overwhelming positive words and advice after I have felt so alone for years.  I guess this is locked now, so I'm not even sure this edit will go through, but I will post in the exjw sub., as that is what of a ton of advice has said to do.

I have no idea how to format sorry

So today me and a couple of my friends including my best friend were having a casual chat. Some time passed and we decided to play some ""game"" where we tell one of the person's secrets that they think we don't know. So it starts with some small things but gradually we all start telling more and more deeper secrets. And just like that, out of nowhere, she says how she knows i've never had a gf because i'm in love with her and don't want other girls (which is very true). I tried laughing it off, and saying how she's crazy, but she insisted that she knows and that I can't lie to her. At that point i think my face turned white and I legit had no idea what to even do or say.

I was sure my behaviour towards her was not in any way indicative of the fact that im in love with her, but somehow sheknows.

Subaru Service center gave my car to someone else,"FINAL UPDATE

So I dropped my Subaru WRX off to be serviced at a third party service center.  They called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when I arrived today I waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  They offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  Should I take any action against them/is there any action I can take against them. 

<EDIT: I need to clarify a mistake I made earlier when posting this, they are not an official Subaru service center as I previously thought.  They are just a third party service center, I have and do not want any hate going out towards Subaru, they did nothing.  This was not their fault and I love their cars/company.  I will be posting a FINAL update later tonight about how everything is ending.  Thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

EDIT:

Thank you all for all of the advice.  Im not good with legal stuff and if I had not posted here I probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  I called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  Turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while I called the cops.  I still have not seen it but I was told the damage was extensive and that I would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  At this point Im going to get a lawyer involved right? I shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  Even if they offer to cover fixing it Im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  They if I didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but Im really not having that.  Not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

FINAL UPDATE:
Hey guys I just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  I did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  Little backstory, when I first bought the car in November the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  That is what I was getting fixed.  That being said, in the end I will be getting a new 2019 WRX, I am pressing charges against the SM for theft, I have filed official complaints with the Motor Vehicle Dealer Board and the Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Section, and I will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  Luckily my lawyer was Pro Bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  All in all I am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  Without this thread I would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  For everyone DM'ing me and asking about what the location is, I am not at liberty now nor will I be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  It is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  Thanks again everyone!

My location is Washington DC

AITA for not changing my tattoo based on my childs pronouns?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Basically I [M42] got tattoos of the names of all 3 of my children. I got them going down my arm and they read from top to bottom (not actual names) ""Andy, Sara, Kate"". I had these tattoos all done at once after Kate was born knowing she would be my last. My oldest child Andy[T22] came out as trans and has decided she only goes by female pronouns now. My wife[F41] immediately supported her and made sure that I would too without any arguement or else she would divorce me. It was a huge family issue for a while but eventually it was solved and everything has been good for the last little while. I'm slowly learning more and trying to accept my daughter and her new pronouns and her name change to Athena. 

The problem arose yesterday when my wife and Athena sat down with me and told me there was an issue. The tattoo going down my arm still reads ""Andy"" and not ""Athena"" and my wife claims this is hurting our daughter and putting a strain on our relationship. My wife told me she wants me to get it touched up to correct it but I explained to her tattoos  don't work like that and you can't just change ""Andy"" to ""Athena"". I told her I would most likely need laser tattoo removal surgery and then would need to pay the cost of a brand new tattoo which I can not afford either of. I explained how my tattoo is such a non issue that I don't understand why this needs to be brought up now. Athena yelled at me and called me a shitty father and said if I don't support who she is, I just need to leave her life. My wife threatened to go stay with her parents with the kids if I don't ""get my act together"". I personally don't see the reason to change the tattoo and this feels like a bigger problem then it should be.

I (25/m) just found out my pregnant GF (22/f) cheated on me. The guy got into a serious car accident.,"I am in shock right now. My relationship started to become strained after the birth of our first child. I found out during dinner with her fucking parents. Her phone started going off like crazy. It was from her friends and they fucking knew. She left her phone at the table to grab her coat after all the fucking waterworks. The bitch was fucking some dude called Andrew and it started recently. Recent enough for me to doubt that the child she carries is even mine. I broke her phone when she tried to grab it from me. Her parents threatened to call the police on me. I left with my son. I don't want her in my life. I don't want her to be involved with my child(ren????) life. I am so fucking angry right now. 

Edit: I want a relationship with my children and not her. I can't be a father long distance. Her boyfriend is brain dead. Her mother told me to ""HAVE SOME SYMPATHY"". FUCK THAT. My life is ruined.

Edit 2: Most users are assuming I am a US citizen. I am not. Once my contract is up, I will have to leave the united states. How an earth can I be a father if I can't even be with my children.

My ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised daughter. Update.,"[Wow, that last post got real popular it seems](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aqylaa/co_my_ex_lied_about_vaccinating_our_immune/), for better and for worse. Seeing as you guys got were interested in it I thought I would come back with an update. 

&#x200B;

Well, a lot has happened since that day. My daughter is safe with me and was let out of the hospital about a week ago. She is getting better every day. I know though, you guys want the full story so here it is

&#x200B;

After I made that post I took the advice given to me and the next time I saw my daughter I told her that it was wrong of me to ask her to keep secrets and that it's ok to tell her mom. Along with that I saw a lawyer recommended to me by a trusted party. When I went to see him he told me that this is ""A case lawyers salivate over"" and that my ex is in a lot of trouble. I immediately filed for emergency custody of my daughter. I also got into contact with the doctor again and explained the situation fully to him. He says that while he will not be getting lawyers involved that he wishes for me to submit the evidence to the police and file a report. Along with this, my lawyer has gotten into contact with the court that originally ordered us to vaccinate our daughter and has handed over everything I gave to him. He has advised me to stay quite on this matter so i'll leave it at my ex is in a lot of trouble with them. 

&#x200B;

During this time, my ex started to get suspicious. Maybe it was because a friend told her about a post on reddit and she freaked out? Who knows. A few days later when I saw her at the hospital we had an altercation. She became hysterical and yelled various threats and insults at me. Including telling me that I want to ""poison our daughter"" right in front of our sick child. She was escorted out of the building and the head nurse had banned her from coming back. After this she sent me a barrage of texts telling me that I am a monster and that if she had vaccinated her that she would be dead now. This was sent to my lawyer. As he puts it, ""she's what lawyers dream of when they hear who's on the other side of the court.""

&#x200B;

Outside of this, i've been advised to stay as quite as possible so i'll leave it with this. 

&#x200B;

This week I received emergency custody of my daughter until our custody hearing later this year. I have heard that the DA is slowly getting ready to move forward with a multitude of charges against my ex and that will land her in jail soonish.

&#x200B;

And that's really it for now. I'm going to follow the advice given by my lawyer and say nothing else to anyone. I do not want the media involved in this for a few reasons so i've left this as vague as possible. When this is all said and done, if the interest is still there I may come back again. But for now, thanks for the advice in the original thread, me and my daughter appreciate you all.

AITA - my daughter's friend had an anaphylactic reaction under my watch,"On Thursday evenings my daughter (9F) goes to dance class with her friend Anna (9F). My wife told me to pick my daughter and Anna up from school, get them something to eat, and take them to dance.

I pick them up from school and ask where they want to go to eat. My daughter asks to go to this noodle place we go to sometimes, and I ask Anna if she would like that and she says sure, so we go. We all order and start eating, when suddenly Anna looks distressed and said she thinks she is having an allergic reaction. I ask her if she has allergies and she says she does to peanuts... and I look in her dish and it's clearly a peanut sauce.

I rush her to the hospital (we were pretty close so it was quicker than 911 would have been), and everything ended up being ok. I felt horrible. I call my wife when Anna is in the hospital room, but there is no answer and I do not have Anna's mother's phone number. So after Anna is given the all clear I immediately take her back to her house and explain what happened to her mother.

Her mother is furious, saying that I could have killed her child. I said back that she should have told me about her daughter's anaphylaxis, why would I assume something like that. She responded that you always ask about a child's allergies before getting them food. She also said that she didn't know I would be getting them dinner (School ends at 4 and dance isn't until 6, so I thought it would be safe to assume I would be giving them food..) I apologized for what happened, but still feel like Anna's mother definitely should have let me know in this situation, and also Anna is old enough to be aware of her anaphylaxis.

"Dear humans: Vanilla is not ""plain"", ""boring"", or ""flavorless"". It *is* a flavor, and a rich one at that. (Blame ice cream's history)","When you are served ice cream, you are served vanilla as the ""default"" ice cream. And it is white, a word often synonymous with ""blank"" or ""empty"". This made kids everywhere assume that vanilla is just the ordinary and boring. But it's not.

It really doesn't help that in the U.S., major food companies are penny-pinching jerks who make cheaper-tasting flavor (and who also ruin people's understanding of ""American cheese"", a cheese which-- when you make it right-- is a good contender with any other flavorful cheeses you see on the shelf every day.) Vanilla was once described in Europe as the ""essence and epitome of flavor"". That's why it became so common. And over time, vanilla was widely substituted with cheaper things. ""Natural vanilla flavor"" isn't vanilla. It's a natural flavor that tastes kinda like it (and often comes from something you don't want to hear about, not that I think there's anything wrong with substitute flavors in general). Real vanilla is fantastic.

Stop misrepresenting vanilla. It's a great flavor. (Although I know that software terms are already dooming ""vanilla"" to continue being thought of as ""boring"", and there's nothing I can do to fix that. As if ""vanilla Minecraft"" is even boring... Sigh.)",unpopularopinion

This is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory,"A male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of Japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  The male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. He said to the female whale, ""Lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" They tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. 

Soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. The male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""Let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" At this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""Look,"" she said, ""I went along with the blow job, but I absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen.""

I (26m) am interested in a woman (27f) who happens to be transgender. She doesn't know that I know. How do I tell her in a way that doesn't cause hurt feelings or concerns for her safety?,"**WE ARE OFFICIALLY TOGETHER NOW**


I'm making a throwaway because there's a reasonable chance that she's on Reddit.
This situation has a few different factors which I'll try and summarize quickly.

We're both on the west coast. 

I'm a pretty stereotypical cis dude, though I'm not saying that anything I do is meant for cis dudes alone, because that's ridiculous. I just fit a stereotype. I work as a carpenter. I like nascar. I lift weights. I don't get astrology (more power to y'all, I just don't really see it clicking for me). I like MMA. I have done a keg stand (poorly). My favourite movie is ""Predator"". I love craft beer and I have, in the past, even caught myself wearing a beer t-shirt to social events. I have a beard and a digital watch.

I also have a ""type"", and that type is REALLY tall women. My family is Dutch, I'm 6'8"" and I like women to be over 6ft or so. It's not a hard preference, but it's a preference I have, which is how I met ""Alice"" (not her real name). 

Alice is fucking awesome. She also happens to be 6'4"". She's part of our mutual friends group, which includes some people who aren't straight and some people who are. A couple of times a month, we meet up at a friend's place and hang out. So not only is she my type, she's somebody that I see fairly often. 

A mutual friend of ours (I'll call him ""Dan"") basically set us up on a date, and we've had a few. We've kissed, but that's about it, and I'm fine with that- no reason to not take things slow. We really do seem to have some chemistry. If I'm wrong about the chemistry, that's fine. I am personally head-over-heels for this gal. We had been texting daily.

During our group meetup a couple of days ago, Alice asked me if I was straight or not. Without really thinking I was like ""yeah, I'm pretty stereotypically straight"". I mean, I was wearing a beer t-shirt at that point. Alice seemed a bit sad about it, maybe uncomfortable, but I didn't really pick up on it or why as I had already had a few beers. The night proceeded as normal, but she left early and we didn't kiss or anything (which is fine, it wasn't a date, I ain't pushy). 

Since then, the texts- which were frequent before- have slowed down considerably, and Alice has been non-committal to dates. She says somethings up, but she's not feeling like explaining it right away. It was a dramatic mood change. I asked Dan what was up, and we talked a bit. He said, ""Y'all know she's trans, right?"" 

She's what?

To make it clear, Dan is under the impression that the entire friends group knows except for me. Admittedly, I'm the newest member of the group. It's apparently not a secret, but I really didn't notice- I wasn't looking either, but there's clues, and I realize now that Alice was probably dropping hints. She legally changed her name when she was 19, I know that much. She's not on speaking terms with one side of her religious family. She's dealt with violence in the past with relationships, which is why she's taking dating slow.

That last bit is what's sticking with me. I am not positive, but I know that trans women have to deal with a metric fuckton of ridiculous bullshit and I can only guess that it might have occurred because she is trans. Even worse, it may have occurred due to somebody like me- some straight dude who might have found out that she was trans and reacted poorly. The question as to whether or not I was straight probably was meant to figure out if I was a candidate or not.

And I mean... Yeah, I'm straight. I go for women. Alice is a woman. I don't really care about the details. I don't care about what is, or what was, between her legs. I think she's fucking awesome and I have absolutely caught feelings for her. Had I known that she was trans when she asked, I'd have said something like ""yeah I go for people who identify as women"" instead of ""yeah I'm straight"". 

I want to tell her that I know and I don't care, but I don't want to invalidate her or reduce her to what she once presented as. I also really don't want to scare her off or make her fear for her life, because I know she's had to in the past and that's horrible. I don't want to accidentally say something that will fuck my chances either, because she's great and I would really love to give this a chance.

I'm thinking of just sending her a message that tells her I heard and I don't care, but that feels too impersonal. Dan has offered to tell her, but I'm not sure WHAT to tell her or how to word it. It feels like I'm invading her privacy to know. I don't wanna bring up old memories of being attacked. I'm worried that I fucked up my chance somehow. 

Tl;dr: clueless straight dude has interest in a trans woman, and is worried sick about the right way to tell her that he knows and doesn't give a fuck. Please help!

UPDATE: we talked. She asked Dan to bring it up to me. All is well! 

Update 2: this has blown up. I can't respond to everybody, but I'll get to a few. Thanks for the good wishes and I'm glad it's brought smiles!

Final update before I go to bed: if this gets outta hand please lock it, mods 

IN CASE YOU ARE WONDERING: yeah we're official now.

TIFU (shoulda just left my neighbor alone),"im keeping names besides mine out of this for privacy. i step outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch roughly 2 hours ago and as im trying to get my lighter to work i hear crying first off my front porch to my house is enclosed by white gate wall with little holes same for the door so nobody can even see through from the outside, however i can see through from the inside ( it's nice to be able to catch scumbags trying to break into my car in the middle of the night because of this) anyway, i look for the crying it didnt sound like a child it sounded like a full grown woman. i quickly find out who is crying directly across the street from my house to the right 1 house i see my neighbor's significant other on her knees crying like she was. A. beaten up, or B. devastated from something such as a breakup. i heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. i assumed the latter. so i wanted to check if she was at the very least unharmed. i usually keep my nose out of peoples business but the inner captain save a hoe in me kicked in for some reason TBH i try to look out for my neighbors regardless my reasoning behind it is because you live next to them so you may as well be social once or twice just to know if things are going to be chill.

i walk across the street and introduce myself i have not spoken to these people before because they are never home until almost midnight and they leave around 6 a.m. damn near everyday they were very quiet and not nosy in anyway so i never attempted to talk to them when a opportunity to do so in the past arose. i say ""hi im taylor, i apologize for the intrusion i just want to make sure you aren't harmed."" clearly very upset she hardly could speak clearly and started to try to say ""he doesn't want to be with me anymore"" im relieved to know she is fine physically so im ready to say ""best of luck"" and head home. not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and its the neighbor he starts yelling is this the motherfucker you're seeing?.. how did he come to that conclusion? ( if i recognized his face sort of why cant he? ) i try to immediately say ""im your neighbor i was just trying to make sure she was unharmed."" then the woman FUCKS ME OVER dragging me into the drama further she yells "" yeah, this is taylor and hes way better than you in everyway!"" my face turns red out of anger my eyes wide open and mouth agape, why the fuck would you say that? the dude likely interpreted that as why did you just tell him the truth im sure thats how he interpreted it because just as i finish saying WTF to this woman I GET PUNCHED SO FUCKING HARD, i should have seen it coming he was visibly very angry. 

&#x200B;

( now I've done time in prison so i am no stranger to fighting the only reason i mention this is because i want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. i do not call cops, i do not ever run from a fight. i never ever ever stick my nose into other peoples business and i broke that rule over a woman crying.)

&#x200B;

i am on someone elses property i get hit. well i have cameras outside my house and i know that his house is within full view so i could have just called the cops and been done with it but no this is something i considered not one bit. i unloaded on this guy he was the same size and build however i was probably in better shape than him aside from my lungs. this woman that made things worse is now full blown hysterical she wailing and crying louder and harder than before and i just beat up my neighbor he beat me up too but this wasn't my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie. soft hands no calluses he absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially but he made a huge mistake as well as i. the noise from this other woman drew the attention of other neighbors now i know most of the immediate surrounding ones except 2 and guess which neighbors came to investigate?take a wild fucking guess? the neighbors i dont know and they are on the phone. (FUCK..........MY...........LIFE) i decided ill go home and pull up the recording so if the police show up i have some sort of defense. i have a record and things look bad im expecting to go to jail for trespassing, assault you name it.

10 minutes later a patrol car arrived and a cop bangs on my door i have the recording on my phone so all i have to do is hand the phone to our officer and let fate decide. i gave my statement in cuffs and im in the back of the car for almost 45 minutes im thinking this is it im screwed. then the magic happened a second patrols car shows up and both officers start talking and watch the video i asked them to look at i know the first officer already saw the video almost right away so im thinking yes they believe me and dude is gonna get his. sure enough they place him in the car and the officer comes over opens the door for me and says step out  unlocks the cuffs and said im not under arrest and that my video saved my ass then they cuff the woman and throw er in the car i was in i asked why she was getting arrested she wasnt in the fight directly. and then i heard the scummiest most absolute piece of garbage thing ever. they both, the couple, tried to say i attacked the dude threatened the woman and i was trying to threaten them from calling the police WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK. an hour ago they were against each other to the point where the woman was getting kicked out of the house. and they actually tried to get me thrown in jail. now the officer said that it looked like what they were saying was true or close to the truth when they watched the video but the audio is what made sure i was innocent they where able to hear part of  the conversation because of their yelling. NEVER AGAIN, NEVER WILL I ENTER DRAMA AND IF MY NEIGHBOR IS SEEN AGAIN I WILL ENJOY SCARING HIM WITH INTIMIDATING LOOKS.

AITA for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?,"So I have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when I was 13. I never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

Growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. It's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

I worked with him on and off through college and I've gotten very good at it.

He asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after I graduated. But my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

I do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. He also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

To no one's surprise, my father said I needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

I refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. My father was upset but I guess he figured he couldn't stop me. We continued having weekly dinners.

For some reason, people are liking my company's work more. I have expanded my company more than my father ever has. I also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. I don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless I want to.

Last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. I admit I did feel bad so I offered him a full time job in my company and that I'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. But I told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

This made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. He said I betrayed him. Then I basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

I do feel kind of guilty I ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. But at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

"Tenant is renting out my apartment on AirBnB. Tenant isn't responding, AirBnB doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. I have no idea how to even handle this.","Location: Toronto, Ontario

I own an apartment in downtown Toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with AirBnB tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. Currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until January.

I decided to list my place up for a rental in late August, for rental until Janaury. Since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). I immediately got a hit by a person named Jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.She signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""No short term rentals, through services such as AirBnB"".

Yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* On Monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. Along with a strong smell of pot. They apparently identified themselves as AirBnB renters. (Apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through AirBnB).
* I am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* I am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* Apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

After getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on AirBnB, using very recent photos of my apartment. I tried to contact Jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

I have tried numerous times to talk to AirBnB, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

Aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. Unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. Do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*EDIT\* I forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. Since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. I want to stop randoms from AirBnB from entering my apartment now. ",legaladvice

"After his father died, BF(30m) revealed a devastating secret to me (25).","My boyfriend (30m) and I (25f) have been dating for 4 years, we met in school (I was in college; he was in grad school). We had a very loving and affectionate relationship, and there were no secrets between us...or so I thought. 

&#x200B;

When BF's father unexpectedly passed away from a heart attack a few weeks ago, I was there for BF as he and his mother coped (cooking, cleaning, etc, all the stuff they couldn't do as they grieved), I held BF as he cried, and attended the wake and service.

&#x200B;

When everything was over, BF told me he wanted to get married but he had to tell me the secret he was keeping, since he did not want to go into marriage with any secrets. The secret may seem small to some, but it was huge and devastating to me. 

&#x200B;

For the entire course of our four year relationship, my BF was meeting up with his ex-girlfriend once a month (or more--I have no way of knowing). He claims it was completely platonic, and they only met as friends, and he sees her a sister. 

But even if that is true (it might be or it might not be, I have no way to contact her and find out), he still hid this from me our entire relationship, so I feel like it is cheating, even if it wasn't physical cheating. 

&#x200B;

He admits that he was wrong, and tearfully apologized. I told him I could not forgive him and this was an extreme betrayal regardless if he cheated physically or just emotionally, and that it wasn't just being friends with his ex but hiding it. He promised not to do it again, and to make it up to me somehow, but I honestly have no idea how that is possible since nothing can erase the four years of lying. 

&#x200B;

As of that conversation, we haven't met up in person yet. But I do have stuff at his house and he has stuff at mine, so whether we breakup or stay together, I do have to face him again. 

&#x200B;

So what should I do? I know the easy answer is breakup. But this is the person I love more than anyone, the one I planned to spend my entire life with, and a grieving human being who just lost his father suddenly, at an early age.

&#x200B;

I truly love him and see that he is sorry, but I don't think I can ever forgive him. Still, he is already really messed up due to his father dying and completely cutting him off might destroy him. Even if I don't want to be with him anymore, I still want to be there for him after the loss of his father. But I am so heartbroken that I can barely get through the day without crying and having panic attacks.

&#x200B;

What do I do?

Tifu by getting a facial,"This happened about two hours ago.

I've been extremely stressed as of late and my boyfriend wanted to help me relax. He flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart's delight. He even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. I really wanted to show him how I much I appreciated all his gestures, so I thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. I start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. He gives me the signal and I activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view I can. That's where the fuck up occurs. I tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. It took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time I figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. At this point, I just sit there and take it up the nose because I'll be damed if I let man gravy get on anything. I immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but I didn't get it all. Not long after, I feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. I still have the smell of semen in my nose. 

Tldr: A dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose.

AITA for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that I helped get addicted to drugs?,"I'm 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

I was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

I managed to get with a beautiful girl named Marcy when I first started getting into the thick of things. She knew who I was but she said she loved me. 

I will regret this for the rest of my life, but I was the person who shot up Marcy for the first time. After that, there was no stopping her. She stuck around with me, probably because I was her dealer more than anything, but then I got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

A year ago she reached out to me on Facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn't hate me for what happened and she hoped I was still clean. 

Last week I got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on Facebook that Marcy had OD'd and there was a funeral service this upcoming Thursday.

I immediately just burst into tears because I hoped that this would never happen and I feel so much guilt over it. 

I want to go to the funeral service for her but I'm afraid that my presence would be unwanted. At the most I would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. I need to do this for myself.

AITA for feeding my vegan nephew meat?,"My sister has been vegan for many years and she is also raising her son vegan. He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. 

I usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew & son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. 

So basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year).

My (29/F) sister (33/F) got divorced over her refusal to keep working. She's still unemployed and is mad at me for refusing to live with her and support her financially,"(I'm posting this anonymously because I don't want this on my main reddit account).

My sister (33/F) used to be married. I (29/F) am single and have never been married. A year ago my sister's ex-husband (38/M?) filed for divorce and left her. The reason he divorced her was because she had wanted to quit her job and be a stay at home mom to my nephew, who was 3 at the time. They both worked full-time and they had a housekeeper come once a week and a part-time nanny for their son. My sister didn't want to do any household chores when she was staying home and still wanted to keep the housekeeper and nanny. Without her salary the couldn't afford it and she said her husband could work a second 20 hour a week job on top of the full-time job he already had. She also wanted to spend exactly the same. Her husband wasn't on board with this and he didn't want her to just up and quit her job. She quit once day anyways and only told him after the fact. He filed for divorce.

In the divorce my sister wanted alimony even though the law didn't really call for it in that situation. Since she was able to work and walked out on her job by her choice, the court counted this against her. She was not awarded alimony because of that and because she earned the exact same amount as her ex-husband. The court also awarded them 50/50 shared legal and physical custody of my nephew. The courts preferred method was one week on and one week off but they can do whatever they want as long as the time is split equally. My sister has to have him on mother's day and her ex-husband on father's day and holidays and his birthday are alternated by year. Since the time is equally split and their income and earning was always the same (ie her ex-husband wasn't a lot richer than her) neither of them has to pay child support to the other. The court counted my sister's former job and the fact there was nothing stopping her from working as income that she was making.

They didn't own a home or property and they rented. Her ex-husband kept putting money in the bank account and paying the bills so his son would be okay and so his credit wouldn't be affected. The lease is up on the last day of March and it isn't paid beyond that. My sister has no job and can't afford the apartment so she has to move. Her ex-husband is no longer giving her money since the divorce became final.

My sister hasn't looked for a job. She lost her appeal to the courts ruling for alimony and child support. She wants to live with me and for me to financially to support her.

Our parents are in their 60s and recently sold their house, paid off any debt they had and moved into an apartment for active seniors. It is small but nice. Their siblings and both sets of our grandparents live in similar kind of apartment buildings. Our cousins also live in either apartments or condos and are married with more than one baby/child. They don't have any room for her. Our parents have enough left from their house sale and pensions to afford their rent/bills for the rest of their lives but they are not super rich and can't afford to support my sister.

I am single. I am working towards my PhD and will have it in a few months. I was living with 2 other PhD students who just finished theirs. One got engaged and moved in with her boyfriend. The other got a job offer overseas. I found a small bachelor apartment for myself. My sister is mad that I didn't chose a bigger place so she could move in with me. She also wants me to support her financially once I complete my PhD and start working.

How do I get her and my family off my back. I don't want to live with her. She has a college degree and there is no reason she can't work beyond her being lazy. I am not worried about my nephew because her ex-husband is the best and most devoted father ever and will step in if she isn't looking after him. She said she will find a rich husband but her parenting and divorce settlement says neither of them can introduce any new boyfriend or girlfriend to my nephew or have an overnight visitor if my nephew with them without permission from a judge. How do I get my sister and family (parents, aunts, uncles and cousins) to stop asking me to live with her (even temporarily). My sister was never this much of an idiot before she quit her job. She is fully able to work and I don't want to support her. 

TL;DR My sister's husband divorced her because she quit her job and refused to work. Now my sister wants me to financially support her and my family wants me to live with her at least. How do I get them off my back?

Employer lured me with an offer letter that has terms that are impossible to meet.,"I graduated from pharmacy school in June of 2018 and I was hired by a pharmacy chain to work in California. I went to school in a nearby state and had to move for this job. 

My offer letter says that I have 90 days from graduation to get licensed. It is NOT possible to get a pharmacist license within 90 days of graduation in California. The process takes about 4 months. I was verbally told by my district manager that the letter is the same in every state and that they don't enforce that 90 day rule.

I moved, passed all the tests, and got licensed in October. I was put on the schedule for only 16 hours each week. The schedule is for several weeks ahead. I brought it to the attention of our scheduler and the district leader. I was told that I MIGHT get more hours at some point if I learn to work more efficiently.

I pointed out that my offer letter says full time work. He says the term isn't legally defined and it can be whatever the company defines as full time. He also said that the offer letter was void because I didn't get licensed within 90 days. He said that if I work with more urgency and get my speed-based metrics up, then everything will be just fine for me.

Is he correct about all this? I went on the company website and they define full time as 30+ hours in order to get health benefits.

 I don't know a lot about the law, but it feels like it would be illegal to lure people with an offer letter that they know has requirements that are impossible. The board of pharmacy has lots of documents available online which show that a 90 day requirement is impossible to meet.

"AITA - I missed my daughter's award ceremony because of my son, she's still not speaking to me","This might be a bit long but thanks for reading. 

I've been a single mom to two kids since they were 6 and 4 - their dad passed away. Around that time, my son was formally diagnosed as autistic. He's not very verbal and prone to physical outbursts when he has a meltdown. He's been in therapies of every kind for his entire life and it's helped somewhat.

Their dad had a life insurance policy which allowed me to stay home as my son's main caregiver while working freelance, but money was tight and finding anyone capable of watching him has always been a challenge. 

My daughter was graduating from college last year. A week before the ceremony, she had an awards ceremony for academic achievement. I was obviously incredibly proud of her. She asked me to come to it and I said I would. 

Her college is two hours from here. I hired a trained sitter who specializes in autism the day of the ceremony. Right as I was about to leave, my son had a meltdown and was lashing out at the sitter. I couldn't leave, and he wasn't calm for hours. I'd left my daughter a voicemail saying I wasn't going to be able to make it. 

She called back that night absolutely livid. She called me a shitty mother, said I had two kids but only cared about one, that I'd missed every game and performance she'd had as a child and it clearly wasn't going to change as adults and that she was just done. She said she knows he can't help it, but her brother is incapable of showing empathy and it made it hard to be around him without resenting him. She hung up and that was it. I've barely spoken with her since. She didn't send tickets for the graduation we were supposed to go to the next week. She hasn't shown up for holidays and I've heard she's engaged but didn't call to tell me. She's cut us out, and in the one of three times we've spoken since she said it's easier for her to not have us around than be disappointed and that being alone at events is nothing new for her, she just doesn't have to bother getting her hopes up I might come now. 

AITA - I've offered family counselling and all other manner of things. I know I wasn't a perfect mom growing up - I didn't make it to her things, but not for lack of caring. I'm heartbroken but I don't think me not showing up in an emergency should have lost me my daughter forever.",AmItheAsshole
Final update : I divorced my husband because of my MIL and now he wants back in.,"So I thought of giving you the last update as you helped me trough this.

I didn't have enough evidence to request an ex parte, aka emergency child custody. So my lawyer and I had to work on steps to prevent child abduction. We got a custody decree that included provisions including passports, travel restrictions etc.

We also had to be very wary of the signs. He in fact quit his job and on a realtors page I saw that he was putting on sale his mother's house. That and my daughters words was all we needed to notify law enforcement for them to keep an eye out.

I couldn't prevent my daughter from seeing her father. We tried to continue business as usual without my daughter feeling something was up. 

 I got a call from the police department regarding the passport situation. My daughter's passport had expired very recently (5 years validity). My ex husband had tried to recuest a passport for my daughter without my knowledge. Which was stupid because even without the decree I had to be present or submit  a notarized document of me stating that he could request the passport.

After that things went actually very fast. He was investigated because he violated the decree and it was found out that MIL had bought 3 tickets with no return date to Mexico. I could request an ex parte. After a shit ton of documents I submitted it. In most cases the judge will evaluate behind closed doors. We had the hearing yesterday (it takes usually 10 to 20 days) wich was very good for me. Atm I have sole custody for my daughter. This is all temporary. My ex has visitation rights if I was present but he can't take her anywhere. This is once the investigation of him is closed. 

I was cursed out by my ex and ex MIL and they said they will try to Contest this but they have no leg to stand on.

My daughter will continue in therapy. Specially after this. I will not prohibit him from seeing her but he needs help.

This was really scary and a very intense 2 weeks. I don't think that I will update again but I wanted to thank you all for your Tipps and support. I am really thankful as I am finally not anxious the whole time! Thank you really much!",relationship_advice

He also said he was in a conference call and could not call at the moment. So I purchased the cards and sent the scammer the details of the cards.  It was not until the scammer asked for a second batch that I realized that it might not be him. I called the office verified that it was not him. I immediately went to the police and filed a report.  Following this I contacted google and they canceled all nonactivated cards. They said they could do nothing about the activated cards. My company also called the credit card company and marked the purchases as fraudulent as they were made on the company card that they issued to me.  In total, I am potentially out 4700$ dollars.

I just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). I was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

He was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. One of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). Unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

He gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

I also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* They both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. They aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* Apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. With her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. So now she is paying her way. 

Anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

[Update] I (27M) left my gf (25F) because she tried to have an affair,"So we had our talk last night. 

I got back and she tried to crack a couple of jokes like things were normal. 

I started it off and told her that I loved her. And I had for the nearly 8 years we were together. But this is something I can't forget or forgive. 

I told her I knew everything said between them. It disgusted me. That it hurt. Deeply. And that she did that. 

Now, I told her I didn't believe I'd be okay because of this for a long time. That's half true. This will of course take plenty of healing but I know I'll be okay. 

Now for her side: 

She told me that none of this had to do with me. None of it was my fault. It was all her. Her mistake her fuck up. She had been feeling unhappy just about life for a while. She felt stuck in life and aimless. 

Then this guy (an ex-friend) came along and gave her attention and it distracted her from how unhappy she was with how her life was. But then it started to progress to a point she didn't know what to do. 

None of what she said she meant to him. She said it because she knew he wanted to hear it. That it almost didn't seem real to her. It almost felt like a game. 

I told her it was real to me. That she still said those things. That she can't take that back or undo it.  

She told me she never intended to hurt me. That that's been the hardest thing for her. Because she knew I treated her better than anyone else will. That I'm the only person who had and will put up with her bullshit. She told me I really did treat her better than she deserved. 

This relationship is officially over though. 

I know there's probably more I wish I could've said but my real takeaway is that I can let go of it. Move on and start to live a new chapter of my life. 

I haven't told her this yet (I'm going to Monday) but I have an opportunity on a new place with a coworker. Their roommate leaves in a few months. So that gives me time to save and get some of my life back in order. 

I have a lot of work ahead of me. A lot of things to figure out. As plenty of people have pointed out, this will be the first time in a long time that I'll be financially and personally independent. I'll only have me to worry about. That's something that'll take some work. But I'm going to welcome the challenge and spend as much time as I can trying to be who I am more than ever. 

I also want to say from the bottom of my heart, sincerely, thank you to everyone that took the time to read and respond in the last post. This has been and will continue to be one of the hardest things I've gone through. But you guys have been so amazingly gracious with your advice. I will always remember this and the kindness of random strangers on this silly little website.

"AITA for firing employee of 20+ years for calling my niece ""Princess""","My niece is kind of... a useless intern at the moment. She was super sheltered by her mother, my brother travels for work... so she has no real life skills.   
I own a business and took Ally \[18\] under my wing. She lives in my basement apartment \[I live above her\] and I am pretty much building an adult from the ground up. Everything from how to dress in the workplace to how to use a computer properly outside of Facebook and Instagram.   
It's working. It's just frustrating for Ally because she should know a lot of this stuff. But her mom is very, very controlling. I expect I am going to do this with my other niece Savannah when she graduates in a few years.   
But it's working out well. Ally is going to start community college in September. But until then I am having her sit in my office and do various small tasks, take an online Microsoft Word tutorial, and catch up on various life goals.   
I have been running my own business for six years now. I took it over from my Mother when she retired. My brother has no interest in the business, though he was offered some stake.   
My mother ran the business for 37 years before I took it over. She hired a woman named Belladonna \[54F\] who has worked there for 24 years. As such, Belladonna feels she is pillar for the company and has asked to become a manager. She has tried to take on managerial roles before, but I wouldn't give her that job if someone paid me.   
She is a little snarky, but I had no issue with it. Until I caught her calling Ally ""Cinderella"" and ""Princess."" She was also ordering Ally to get her coffee. When Ally said she was working on something, Belladonna told her ""well, I guess you just sit down and do nothing then.""   
I fired her on the spot.   
My Mother thinks I was an asshole for doing that. But I don't tolerate people who think being older means they have a right to be snarky. I told people what Ally was doing at the job, and that she was not an intern. She was simply my niece assisting me on stuff I needed help with.

My bf (20M) lied to me about wearing a condom. What do I do now??,"I originally posted this on r/sex but was advised to post it here as well to get additional feedback. 

So my bf and I just got a new apartment together a few weeks ago and are kinda new to the living together thing. Since we are still sorting out our financial situation and I'm not on the pill, I asked him to buy condoms bc I didn't want an accident to happen and I either have to buy an emergency contraceptive or end up pregnant. He initially said no but after about 2 days he agreed (although rather grumpily). Tonight during sexy time, he wore a condom and then afterwards took it off and threw it away. A little while later, he asked if I wanted to go for round two and I agreed. I felt him reach for another condom and heard the crinkling of the wrapper and even him opening the wrapper so naturally I assumed he put a new one on. Midway through, he asked if he could take off the condom and I told him no. He  then told me that he actually hadn't been wearing one the whole time during round two. I immediately got out from under him and got upset. I felt like he broke my trust. He then actually put the condom on and said for me to calm down and that he was just playing around and wanted to continue since he now had a condom on. I was still very upset and told him no bc that's not cool. He got angry and took the condom off and threw it at the wall. I then got dressed and went to the spare bedroom. I heard him get out of bed and close the door after me. After cooling down for a few hours, I was going to go back and talk to him but I found the door locked. He locked me out of the room. I then texted him that I was sorry but that he shouldn't have done that. I little bit later and I heard snoring in the room and the door is still locked so I'm staying in the guest bedroom tonight. I am still kinda upset and can't shake the feeling of betrayal. I personally don't think that I'm in the wrong but maybe I'm just too close to the situation. Am I the bad guy?? Am I overreacting?? Does he have a right to be mad at me?? Please give any advice you may have. I would really appreciate it.

UPDATE: First of all, I just wanted to say that I didn't expect to get so much interaction let alone well wishes and support. I am so thankful for everyone and although I can't reply to every comment, I'm at least trying to look at them all. Also, I am back on birth control. Now on to what happened yesterday. 

When I woke up Friday morning, bf was already up and getting ready for work. As soon as he left, I went into his room and started gathering my belongings to move into the guest bedroom. I guess he forgot something bc he came back inside and found me in his room collecting my things. He told me that he loved me and that he was sorry for what he did and he shouldn't have been the one to get mad. He also said that although he didn't want me to, he wouldn't stop me from moving my things into the guest bedroom if that's what I wanted. I should have said something to him then but I knew that what I had to say was a lot more than the 10 minutes he had before he had to leave for work so I stayed quiet and looked at the floor. He hugged me and called me his baby and then left for work fr this time. We didn't speak anymore until later that evening when I asked him if he could pick me up from work (I currently don't have a car). He agreed. During the ride home, he acted casually as if nothing had happened less than 24 hours before. When we got home, bf started cooking dinner. I didn't know how to start the conversation so I sat and thought on it. Later that night, I went into his room and he already knew why I was in there. I told him that what he did the night before was NOT okay and that since we got the apartment he had been meaner and way more aggressive toward me which lead me to think that he didn't actually want to get the apartment. I reminded him of the condom incident and a few others before that and told him if he wanted to break the lease, we could and that I would find another place to stay in the meantime. He started crying and apologized and said that he didn't even realize what he was doing and that he didn't want to be like his dad (who was very abusive). He said that it wasn't his intention and that he was very sorry. He also said that he loved getting the apartment and wanted to stay. He also said that if I wanted to keep my stuff in the guest bedroom, he would respect and support my decision and that I was welcome to the master with him whenever I felt like it. He said that he appreciates me telling him about his fuck ups so he can learn from them and that he'd do his best to be better. Then we said good night and I went back to my room.

TIFU by letting our dog hang out while we did the dirty," So  my girlfriend has been working early mornings all week due to some  staff shortages, and even though we've been feeling frisky all week, we  haven't had the time. So, when Friday night rolls around, we're raring  to go.

Usually, our dog hates being near  us when we're rolling in the sheets (literally) because there's nowhere  for her to lie on the bed. So, her thing is that she curls up in her  doggie bed and waits for it all to blow over before coming back onto the  bed for cuddles.

Sparing everyone the  details, the foreplay's pretty good. Unfortunately, it's a little too  good, as for some reason our dog starts getting concerned and maybe  thinks that our sounds are distress calls or something. She hops on the  bed and starts licking my gf's face. It's cute, until she decides to  start to lick mine.

In a fit of ""oh no I  can't let her lick my lips because then I can't kiss my girlfriend  anymore"" madness, I reflexively back away... and knee my girlfriend's,  uh, nether regions in the process.

She  rolls over in pain, but she's cry laughing, and both of us just are lost  at how absurd this has been. Meanwhile, our dog, oblivious to it all,  is having the time of her life as my girlfriend is dying of pain and I try my best to comfort her.

Needless to say, I didn't get any last night. Will try again tonight, but I'll keep the dog in her crate as a precaution.

Girlfriend's little brother used my collection of '64 Kennedy Half Dollars to buy drugs,"My girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. He lives with us (we are both late 20's and have FT jobs).

I have been stacking 1964 Kennedy half dollars for ten years now. For those that don't know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

I had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

I insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like I mentioned. Whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that's what her brother thought he was stealing. And according to her ""he only got $100 of weed so that's fair"". Okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? What then?

She also called my silver stack ""useless and paranoid and stupid"". I collect them partially for a store of value Incase of inflation or deflation, but I also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

I guess I'm looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they're worth for the value of silver. It also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. Which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?",relationship_advice
"Ex husband is sending his family and friends to my house and my work, does this violate the protective order? And is this considered stalking?","Oklahoma here. So for some reference, my ex husband is a horribly abusive narcissist, during our marriage he tortured me physically, mentally, and emotionally. He kidnapped me in 2017 and I managed to get away and run to the police, where I got my protective order. I have PTSD and cut every tie to him completely out of my life, and I've managed to make a much happier life for myself and I'm even making progress with my PTSD. Well I was, until all this has been happening. Okay now on to where I need help! 

About 2 weeks ago I ran into my ex's best friend at the casino. He sat and watched me and texted someone on his phone for 10-15 minutes. Then a few days later, my coworker texts me telling me that they ran into my ex and he was asking if they knew me (we were old acquaintances anyway) and they said no. Next, about a week ago my ex's brother shows up at my house and rings the doorbell, and I didnt answer. Then, he has his stepbrother send me a friend request on Facebook. And 3 days ago, I was at work (retail) and one of his friends comes in high as a kite and watches me for a few minutes. And the final event, he had one of his best friends come out to my house this morning and ring my doorbell. I have no contact with any of these people, and I havent in over a year and a half. I've been a stone cold bitch with strict no contact with anyone who could even be friends of friends of his. 

So my question, 1) is he violating the protective order by doing this? I have no idea if they were trying to relay a message from him or not. 2) does this qualify as stalking? 3) what are my options?

AITA For Telling My GF She Doesn't Understand Real Life?,"I'm M23 my gf is F21 and we've been together for about 2 years now.

Because of this she's never had a job, doesn't care about school really (She's doing fine though but in a easy program), or about having to make money in the future. My car broke down recently and I've been taking the bus/subway to work and she's been razzing me about it saying its sketchy taking public transport etc. I told her I'm saving up again for a honda, and will get it next month. She just tells me to ask my parents for the money or dip into my savings. I told her she has no idea how most people live real life so she shouldn't be giving out financial advice because her dad funds her whole life. She got very pissed at me and said that she's not dumb and so on and basically called me a huge asshole. Her friends also contacted me and told me to apologize to her, and oh her friends are the exact same way. Spoiled rich white girls who go to Western (my ontario mans will get this one).

AITA for not paying for the meal?,"On a road trip last week, my girlfriend and I stopped at a rural diner for brunch. We sat down and a waitress opened our menus before she put them on the table (that detail is important later). It was a very nice meal honestly. Our total was around $25. I was ready to pay with my debit card.

The waitress then told us that this was a cash only establishment. Unfortunately I had zero cash on me. ""How were we supposed to know?"" I asked. She shows us some tiny text on the front of the menu. Because of the way she'd put our menus down and taken them away, we had not seen the front. There was literally no indication of their cash-only business other than that.

She sighs and points to an ATM on the other side of the dining room. At this point I'm still apologetic so I went there with my card. I noticed it had a fee of, I shit you not, $9. I asked to speak to the manager. She brought the owner.

I told the owner this is ridiculous. I suggested he let me go get cash from somewhere legit, or take $9 off the bill if he really wanted me to use that ATM. Nope. He threatened to call the police. I said go ahead. My girlfriend felt the same way. Long story short, the cops agreed with me, and we left without paying anything.

I told my sister about this today. She thinks the cops were wrong and I was being an asshole. Because ""you wasted everyone's time over 9 fucking dollars."" I think the owner is the asshole. The only part I regret was not being able to tip the waitress.

AITA for leaving/ghosting my GF that was financially dependent on me without warning after discovering she cheated on me,"**UPDATE:** 

I was not expecting to post an update so soon, but I was hit with a bombshell this afternoon.

Over the weekend, both of our parents had tried to come talk to me. However I had simply ignored the knocks on the door and eventually they left. However of course they know that I can't avoid work. So they wait outside my house this afternoon to ambush me as I get home from work. With them is my girlfriend. They insist I talk to my girlfriend and I eventually relent and our parents leave.

Once inside, she starts apologising and begging for forgiveness. Saying that our relationship is the best thing that ever happened to her, she will never forgive herself.... Basically everything that you'd expect a cheater to say.

...And then she gives the most ridiculous excuse I've ever heard. She says that a few weeks ago she found out she was pregnant, she started having conflicted feelings on if she was ready to settle down and start a family, and so she reached out to her ex for support. This emotional support quickly turned physical

This makes NO sense. We have ALWAYS talked about having kids excitedly.

She takes out two pregnancy tests showing positive results. She also takes out an unused one and says she can take it now if I don't believe her. So she takes it, and sure enough she's pregnant. She says it's 100% mine as she didn't cheat on me until after she got pregnant. I ask to see her phone. She reluctantly hands it over and, sure enough, she's been texting him non-stop since I threw her out.

I tell her I need time to process this and ask her to wait outside. Once outside I lock the doors, unblock her on WhatsApp, and send her a long text. I'm reciting this by memory so I don't have to open WhatsApp and see her reply.

>Whether you end up having this baby is entirely up to you. But you should know the following. First, if the child is mine, I will be a good father and take care of it, but you will never be anything more than the mother of my child. We will never get back together. The moment you cheated on me, our relationship was over for good. Secondly, I will not interact with you at all until the child is born. Don't reach out to me until then, I want nothing to do with you. Finally, I will not have ANY role in the kid's life - nor will I sign any birth certificate - until I get a paternity test. This child could have been the greatest blessing to our relationship and future, instead you turned them into an excuse to cheat. I will never forgive you for that.

I have not read her reply, and don't intend to tonight. I also won't post any updates after this. I get the impression that the kid is probably mine, so I'm basically anchoured to her for the rest of my life now.

---------------------------------

**Original Post**

----------------------------------------------------

**With regards to the meta post:** I know I'm not an asshole for leaving her. I'm more concerned with the way I went about it.

-------------------------

My gf and I have been together for 7+ years, have long talked about marriage, and talked even more about future kids. She quit her job a couple of years back to pursue a medical degree.

Last week I discovered she had cheated on me with an ex-BF from high-school. I needed to use her phone to call mine, and went I unlocked her phone it was open on a WhatsApp conversation between them. I have nothing against the guy personally, but he's going no where in life and I don't understand why she'd want to be with him.

Anyway, rather than sadness/heartbreak this actually just made angry. Angry that I've put so much into this relationship and woman that I thought would be the mother of my future children. Angry that I've been supporting her through college including rent/food/tuition. Just angry.

So I arrange a locksmith to change the locks the next day (**edit: with landlord's permission**) while she's at class, pack up as much of her stuff as I can find, and leave it outside. Text her of what I've done, and say if she wants to get anything else I've missed to have her brother come and get it - I don't want to see or speak to her ever again.

Anyway, since I did this both my parents and hers have been relentlessly calling me. They say that what she did is wrong - but it's no reason to throw away 7+ years - and that if I kick her out she will be forced to drop out and waste years of education.

What do you guys think? Am I the asshole here? Should I swallow my pride and approach this differently?

I'm a big dude, I'm 6'4 and I'm always goddamned hungry. I'm a firefighter so I'm always on my feet and simply put, I just love foooooood. My wife always eats stuff like salads and nuts but she will ALWAYS help herself to some of my food which pisses me off because it's just the right amount of food that I want to eat but she'll go ahead and take some. 

I've asked her so many times to leave my food alone and she'll get really defensive and say 'it's just a little babe, you'll be fine!' Except I'm not fine, I'm hungry. And then when I'm hungry I get hangry and I snap at everyone cuz I'm goddamned hungry!

Things came to ahead at our kids 3rd birthday party. Wife said no to cake, despite me bringing over a slice
to her, so I gave that slice to my cousins kid who was on his second slice. my girl ended up eating the whole slice whilst I held the goddamn plate and then when I went to get myself some all the cake had finished.

Lately my MIL gave me the idea to just spice my food to stop my wife from taking mine, since she can't stand spicy food.  I tried that yesterday, I ordered pizza and asked my wife if she wanted one. She said no. I went ahead and got pepperoni and jalape√±os, and predictably when it came she came over and got all mad because it was spicy and she couldn't eat it.

I told her I had to take drastic measures because I'm fed up of sharing my food and she called me a selfish asshole.

TIFU by not reading a Tinder Bio,"Alright, so this happened ""yesterday"" so its technically  YIFU. But whatever. 

So, a couple weeks ago i was swiping on el tinder when i saw a cute goth girl. Lets call her Lizzie. Anyways, i was fairly tired at that moment and only glanced over the bio. This was the fuckup. 

Lizzie and i match and get to talking. She is really nice, into the same nerdy shit i am, a fantastic shitposter, good conversationalist. and Very,Very cute. I'm thinking she is already my next girlfriend assuming things go well when we meet.

Couple days later we go on the date. Now, I've been catfished before, so I'm already expecting that she won't be as cute as she was online. Nope. She shows up looking fantastic. (Just like in the simulations!) We get sushi and are having a good time, so we decide to go back to my place. 

 After a drink, some anime and good conversation, we start making out. Things are getting...heavy so we go into my room, she takes off my pants and starts giving me head. Awesome.  She took off her bra, not flat chested either, double awesome. (BIG TITTY GOTH GF REEEE) Anyways I'm not the type to keep a girl waiting on her knees. (*tips fedora*) So i ask her to get on the bed and we make out some more and i go to take off her skirt. The next few moments were something like this:

""Uhh... whatcha got there..?""

""Oh my god i thought you knew""

*windows shutdown noice as my boner collapses*

""..nope. I had no clue""

Soooooo, she had a dick. Turns out, she did say she was trans in her bio. Pre op.  Been on hormones for a while and is going to make the switch. While im not transphobic or homophobic, i do have boundaries. I didn't freak out or anything. I assured her its fine, y'know shit happens. We ended up getting dressed, knocking back a few more shots and exchanging life stories until she sobered up and went home. Ended up friends after all was said and done. 

Always. Read. Bios.

TLDR: didn't read a tinder bio, got my dick sucked by a pre op trans girl. Took off her skirt, saw a dick.

EDIT: This is my first ever post on reddit. Cant believe its made so many people laugh. Glad more people got something out of my potentially awkward situation!

EDIT: A lot of people asked if i would consider dating her post op. Yeah. Why not? I felt like we hit it off.

AITA for exploding on my father's wife,"Throwaway  

Hear me out on this one.

In regards to ages, I'm 17, Dad is 43, and father's wife 27 or 28.

Six years ago, it came out during couple's therapy that my father was cheating on my mom and that his mistress was pregnant. My mom initiated divorce. Six months after the divorce was finalized, my father married his now wife and they had three kids. My dad has apologized for his actions and we are still doing therapy, so one day I can truly forgive him.

I do not like my so-called stepmom, but in regards that she is father's wife, I begrudgingly show respect. I have never called her out of her name until later in this story. If she speaks to me, I will say something back. If I am in her home, I will clean up after myself. However, I will always refer to her as my father's wife and she will never be a prominent figure in my life. This is something she cannot accept.

I have never let my true feelings about her be known, until the other day. While at my father' house, she attempted to make a cringe-worthy joke about my girlfriend with the saying ""The blacker the berry the sweeter the juice,"" and said that I was good enough looking boy and she was confused about why I would go out with a dark-skinned black girl and not someone white like myself. I guess the look on my face told her to shut up, so she changed the subject.

She then revealed that when my dad gets back from his TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment); she had booked a photoshoot for family portraits of us and she wanted to do a special photo of me and her two sons holding signs that say ""Don't mess with her,"" with her 2-month-old daughter. I have never been in any of the previous family portraits because I refused to and my Dad said I didn't have to.

I told her I was not going to participate

She asked why I was being difficult and that just she wanted family pictures with all of her children.

Six years' worth of hurt came out. I told her she was a fool to ever think I was her child or that I considered her family. From my perspective, she was nothing, but my father's racist side chick, who had nothing better to do, but chase after a married man and sit on her ass all day. I took it a step further and fully implied that her daughter wasn't my father's child because she looks nothing like him.

She turned red and started crying, saying how disrespectful I was and I had no right to talk to her in such a manner. I fully admit I called her a Bitch and stated she didn't even deserve any respect from me because she didn't respect my mother's marriage and if she ever disrespected my girlfriend again, she would live to regret it. After realizing what I had said, I left and haven't talked to her since.

Everyone that I have talked to say I should at least apologize for calling her a bitch and I don't mind doing that.  However, certain people say I shouldn't have gone off on her, because my dad was gone and she just had a baby, etc.

TIFU by putting a vibrator on my boss's desk,"This didn't happen today, but years ago. I worked at an insurance agency.  It was a small office with a receptionist and a few insurance producers.  We were a tight knit group and would frequently joke around with no subjects being off limits. Not your typical professional environment.

One of the producers, we'll call her Lisa, had a boyfriend named Dick.  Lisa was a recent divorcee and her relationship with Dick was very on again off again.  At the time this happened, they were fighting and not really speaking.

Around the holidays we did an office grab bag thing.  I picked Lisa's name out of the hat.  I decided that since she and Dick weren't‚Äã in a good spot and that she complained about how horny she was all the time, I'd get her a vibrator as her gift.  This thing was thick, about 8"", black, and had a gold tip.  

So we do the grab bag and everyone has a good laugh that Lisa got a vibrator.  We're chasing each other around the office with it and having a grand old time.  As things die down, it got put on the boss's desk.

Picture the things on a regular office desk...computer, stapler, some files, pens, phone etc... and a big black and gold vibrator.  A woman comes in to buy a homeowners policy and says: I have an appointment with Boss.  Boss had no idea the vibrator was on his desk until he and the woman went into his office and sat down.

The rest of us in the office immediately realize what was happening and we lost it.  There is 0% chance the woman didn't see it.  Somehow, Boss was able to stoically make it through the sale unscathed.  Neither he or the customer acknowledged the giant gold tipped dong.  More so, this was the woman's first house and sales like that usually take a little longer as additional documents are needed for the closing and we would usually take extra time to explain the policy as insurance can be confusing to first time buyers.

The lady leaves and Boss comes out red as a tomato.  He's not even pissed because he realizes how funny the situation is...and he still made the sale.  

I've always wondered if that woman ever tells the story about buying a homeowners policy with a vibrator on the desk. 

Sounds like the story is over.... not quite.  Lisa put the vibrator in her glove box.  A few days later her 8 year old son was rummaging around in her car, found it, turned it on and walked into her house rubbing it on his face saying: look Mom, I'm shaving!

I think it might have gotten thrown in the garbage after that.

Tl;Dr: put vibrator on boss's desk, he didn't know and conducted business with customer. Then a 8 year old boy thought it was an electric razor and rubbed it all over his face.

AITA for going to the police over a 'prank',"Throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further. 

To preface this, I (24F) am vegan, and have been for a good 10 years. I have not eaten meat since I was roughly 3-4 years old when I found out where meat comes from (spoiler alert: there were a lot of tears). This is no secret and everyone in my life knows and respects this - or so I thought. 


Four nights ago, I was at a party and I will admit, I got white girl wasted. My friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. I checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" To which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). They tasted off to me but I figured it was just because I was drunk. I was wrong. 

I found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends Snapchat story. The story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where I asked if it was vegan). The and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when I found out I ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the CHICKENS!!!""). I took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

They all think that I'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so Reddit, AITA? In my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. In their view, it was just a prank.",AmItheAsshole
"Why are there so many popular right-wing ""dominant debaters"" (Ben Shapiro, Milo Yiunnapalosi), but left-wing counterparts seem nowhere to be found?","Tl;Dr: The personality of an ""always right"", dominant debater, is common amongst several right-wing public figures, but I have trouble understanding why the same personality seems so scarce within left politics.

The whole ""arguing with facts"" , being extremely confident and forward, is my best way of describing the personality of the two mentioned in the title (amongst others, that Steven Crowder guy from the meme). You see them debating hundreds of people and ""never being wrong""; although usually they're arguing less experienced people.

I'm not taking a political stance here, but generally these debaters have compilations on youtube on how they ""destroy a liberal"" or ""dismantle socialism in front of a communist crowd"", and the whole idea of someone speaking that is regarded as never being wrong, usually puts me off.

But I never see a similar personality type of a left-wing debater. Hell I can't recall seeing a prominent left wing figure that does public speeches and debates where they ""dismantle the capitalist agenda"".

Again not in any way arguing for or against right wing/left wing. I don't think right wing argues with facts and left with feelings, thats just the result of the image Ben shapiro seems to commercialize",NoStupidQuestions

LPT: The Fibonacci sequence can help you quickly convert between miles and kilometers,"The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where every new number is the sum of the two previous ones in the series.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.  
The next number would be 13 + 21 = 34.

Here's the thing: 5 mi = 8 km. 8 mi = 13 km. 13 mi = 21 km, and so on.

Edit: You can also do this with multiples of these numbers (e.g. 5\*10 = 8\*10, 50 mi = 80 km). If you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest Fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. E.g. 70 mi ‚âà 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. Subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.

This works because the Fibonacci sequence increases following the golden ratio (1:1.618). The ratio between miles and km is 1:1.609, or very, very close to the golden ratio. Hence, the Fibonacci sequence provides very good approximations when converting between km and miles.",LifeProTips

Also, so often they didn't report it or they didn't handle it properly from a criminal-investigator point of view; they went and showered right away or waited too long for evidence to be useful.

"My college says if I miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes","(IA) I was sexually assaulted (while home over a break, not by another university student) and the trial of my attacker starts in two weeks. 

I am a university student about five hours driving distance from my home town where the assault occurred, and I'll need to travel there to testify at the trial. 

I'd spoken to my advisor and all my professors notifying them of the days I'd be out, and everyone was understanding, giving me take home versions of any tests or work I'd be missing. 

Unfortunately, one of the days I'll likely need to be out coincides with midterms, so my professor was required to get approval from the academic dean and dean of the college to issue a take home midterm. 

His request for the take home midterm was denied, and when it came to the attention of these deans, they contacted all my professors and informed me if I missed that many classes (it would be approximately two of each class, maybe three depending on some court scheduling, and four of another class but it meets every day of the week.) 

My professors were comfortable marking these as ""reported absences"" which basically means there was a justification like a doctor's note or other official documentation. 

I showed the deans that I was in fact being called to testify by the defense so it wasn't  even really like I had a choice. I figured that would be enough documentation. 

The dean said that ""personal non-medical conflicts"" could not be counted as reported absences and would be treated as unreported absences, (so, treated as the same thing as if I'd just  slept through class). They suggested I apply for a leave of absence for the semester because otherwise I'd be dropped from my classes at the third absence and be on probation if dropped from two or more classes (school policy). 

This attack took enough from me already, I went to great lengths to be sure I didn't miss a day of school while recovering, I do not want this man to derail my life further by pushing back my graduation date. 

I spoke to the title IX Office who'd promised me they could help, but it turns out their idea of helping was helping me plan my leave of absence. 

I do not want to take a leave of absence. All my professors were ready and willing to work with me and I was/am entirely capable of keeping up with the work. 

Do I have any legal recourse here against the school?

Alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn't have the social acceptance it does.,"Alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven't done many drugs. It slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. In high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance I've ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

There is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don't seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

I really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower IQ and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify I don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a SLIGHT buzz regularly.

"Given incorrect dose of Allergy Shot, went into anaphylactic shock and health provider refuses to cover my expenses. What to do?","I've been getting allergy shots for close to 2 years and have been at a maintenance dose for more than a year (receiving the same concentration) .

My regular visit usually goes like this: Nurse asks me preliminary questions, shows me vials of various concentrations (blue - 1:10000 concentration, yellow - 1:1000 concentration, red - 1:100 high concentration), verifies the vial to be administered, verifies my name and date of birth on the vial, then proceeds to administer the shot. I wait 30 minutes to ensure that no major allergic reactions occur. During my maintenance dose, I usually receive 1 mL of the yellow vial.

During this visit, my regular nurse I usually get my shots from was gone. The substitute nurse did not ask me the usual preliminary questions, did not verify my name/date of birth on the vial, had the syringes pre-loaded with the allergy shot serum and proceeded to administer the shot. I look at the counter where the vials are usually placed and all I saw were only the red vials, which is 10x the concentration I usually receive. I didn't think of anything since the other vials might've been placed somewhere else. So I begin the 30 minute waiting period.

After 20 minutes of waiting, I feel really flush, itchy, and hot. I begin to suspect that the red vial was administered to me. The nurse checks up on me, I tell her that I'm getting a reaction. She puts her hands to her face, sighs, then mumbles ""Why me?"". I tell her she might've administered the red vial to me since it was the only vial I saw on the counter and she denies that she had given that to me. At this point, I'm going into analphylactic shock. The nurse calls a doctor and another nurse, administer an epi-pen, and call the ambulance to send me to the ER. The allergic reaction subsets after 5 hours in the ER.

I filed a grievance with the clinic manager to see if I could get all my expenses covered however they couldn't conclude that they had given me the incorrect dose. This is close to $2000 in out of pocket expenses after insurance. I request my medical records and see that there is no clear evidence of what concentration was administered to me. I look at the ambulance EMT notes, and they noted I was given double the allergy shot dose.

3 weeks after my allergic reaction, I go in to get another allergy shot and my main nurse notifies me that it was charted I was given the 1mL of the  red - 1:100 high concentration dose. This doesn't appear in my medical records for the day of my appointment, it doesn't even show what I was administered on that day. Now I want to take legal action against the clinic however I have no idea where to start, what to do, and how to approach the situation. Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!

AITA for calling a pregnant woman a c***?,"I was at the bookstore the other day and as I approached the cash I saw a very angry and very pregnant woman who was visibly very upset. 

As I got closer I listened to her as she bombarded this teenage girl working the register. She was upset that a book that said it was in stock online wasn't available at the store. She was complaining that she had wasted her time and energy by coming down to the store when the book wasn't available. The girl at the cash was looking extremely uncomfortable and I could tell she felt bad. When the girl said there was nothing she could do, the pregnant woman started cussing at her and calling her stupid and a ""inconsiderate little bitch"". As the girl was calling other stores to try and track down the book the woman looked at me and expected me to side with her said ""what's the point of customer service if they won't help you?"" 
At this point, I had felt horrible for the young girl and I knew I had to say something. So I looked at the woman and I said ""I just hope whatever you give birth to isn't a total c*** like his mom"". The woman looked at me in total shock and then started cussing at me telling me her husband was in the parking lot. I said I didn't care and that she should just go to a different store because she was making everyone uncomfortable. She cussed and swore at me before calling her husband on her phone. He came in, didn't say much (I'm 6'2, 210 pounds) and then convinced her to leave. As she left she flipped off the store and told me to fuck myself. 

Now, I still think sticking up for the girl was the right thing to do, but my friend that I was with told me it was inappropriate to call a pregnant woman the c word. I felt like if there was ever anyone who deserved the c word it was this woman. The cashier was using her hijab to wipe tears from her eyes after- the woman humiliated her. She thanked me by the way and her manager comforted her, so I think she's ok. 

Ps, in the parking lot, the woman honked her horn and flipped me off as she drove by. 

I still feel it was the right thing to do, but is my friend right in saying I was wrong in using the c word?

EDIT: a few people have mentioned that I should not have included the hijab comment.

AITA for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?,"Ok this is the worst. I'm losing sleep over this.

I'm getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and I cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

My brother is gay, but my family doesn't know, only me and my parents know. I come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century's mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

So my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, I'm so happy my brother found a great guy. But it's kind of a secret, as he hasn't told my family he is gay.

I've been telling him for years that he should come out, cause I know it stresses him a lot, and I think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus I bet a few family members already know anyway.

But he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won't accept it and it will be a lot of drama. I see the opposite, I see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. I have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn't accept my brother being gay.

Anyway, that's his decision not mine, so for now he won't say anything.

Until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. I was not expecting that to be honest. So he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

If it was any other occasion I would be supportive obviously, but I don't think my wedding day is the day to do that.  Imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. And I don't want to get the attention away from my fianc√©e, that's her day. And I dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and I think it's a pretty good reason

I asked him why my wedding day, he said it's because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. This is killing me. I would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if I had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and I can't do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

I didn't even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

With a heavy heart, I asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that I hope he understands me. He  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

Next day I got a text and he said "" dont worry, going alone"". I tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don't seem to know what's happening because they didn't say anything.

He eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

This is the worst situation of my life, am I the asshole for handling it the way I did?

PS 1: I wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

PS 2: Thanks for the gold and stuff!

Update: spoke to fianc√©e, couldn't keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

Clarification: I know it won't be my brother that would cause trouble. The trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. Doesn't matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.I don't want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother.

At first I thought that my ex maybe hadn't told me yet because it hadn't come trough. But no he told my daughter to keep this as a secret because momy would get sad if she knew that daddy was going away.

So I am fucking livid. And also sad because I will have to tell my daughter no. Once again I feel lost.

Update: I [34M] broke up with my [33F] girlfriend in the nastiest way possible because of what happened yesterday and today.,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9g0n3/i_34m_just_discovered_the_real_side_of_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

So after I went home yesterday, I cooled down a bit and finally collected my guts to call her.

I called her, she accepted my call and said ""What?"" I told her ""I'm sorry for overrea..."" and she dropped off the call.

I texted her, ""I need the copy of my house keys back, I'm breaking up with you.""

She didn't respond. I got into my car went to her place, knocked at least ten times before storming off.

I looked in the parking lot, her car wasn't there. So I texted her ""Where are you?"" ten minutes pass, no response.

I drove back home and I noticed her car parked next to my house, I carelessly park my car, run inside the house and there I see her collecting all my shit (my laptop, my iPad...) that's when I tell her ""What are you doing?"" 

She tells me, ""I'm taking back what's mine."" That's when I tried to grab the things off her arms before she screamed, ""Get off me."" She started kicking me and ran out the house.

I tell her to give my shit back or I will call the cops, she doesn't react to the warning, so I whip out my phone and dial the cops.

She drove off with my: laptop, my work phone and my iPad.

Cops arrive roughly 20 minutes later and I told them what happened and I tell them the location of her house.

They sent off a cop to her house to collect the electronics.

The cops start asking me questions like ""Is this the first time?"".....

40 minutes later I got my stuff back.
She has been put into a cell for eight hours and and she will have to attend court the following week.

Now I'm contemplating why life always gives me the shit end of the stick.

TIFU picking up the wrong person from the airport and getting pulled over at gun point by the Police.,"I live near a smaller airport and I help out at the local Turkish community center.  I'm white but I go to a free dinner they do every other Thursday and it is amazing, so I chose to volunteer every once in a while.   Set up, take down, help older people out, the usual volunteer at a center thing. I've met a ton of awesome people and they are a blast to hang out with.

So last week, I was tasked to pick up an older woman flying in from Turkey as she was the guest of honor at a fundraiser they were having. I was told she knew little to no English and I wasn't the first choice to go get her, I was just the only one available seeing everyone else had bigger jobs to do. 

They give me a sign with her surname on it, her flight number, and a general description of what she looked like. Whiteboard in hand and a little hesitant, I set off for the airport ready to get my cargo.

I pull up to the international gate and immediately an Eastern European woman standing all alone. I get out with my sign that says 'Demir' and she smiles with great joy, points at the sign, points at herself and without hesitation, loads her bags in the car and hops in. Last name? Check. Eastern European? Check. Not much English? Check. can't believe my luck!!

I pull out of the airport and immediately head in the direction of the Turkish center with my passenger all buckled up ready for the 35 minute drive.  About 15 minutes into the ride, she pulls out her phone and begins to rustle around. She calls someone and frantically speaks in Turkish. I'm thinking she left something on the plane or at home. I felt bad but I couldn't do anything about it at the time, I was driving in the freeway.

10 minutes later, I'm off the freeway and a cop passes. He immediately flips a bitch, lights me up and I pull over. At this point I'm freaking out and when I turn around, I see the lady has Uber out and upon further inspection, I'm not the Uber driver.....

The cop tells me to get out and I am taken down very fast, by a plethora of cops, handcuffed, and put in the back of a squad car with zero information. My head hurts from the slam against the ground and I'm fully aware of the kidnapping situation I'm in. 

After about 15 minutes of the lady screaming in Turkish to the police and other cars arriving, an officer opens the door and asks me my story.  I ask him to use my phone to contact the Turkish center and the lead woman comes down to explain what happened. 

Little did I know 'Demir' is one of the most common surnames in all of Turkey. So when the lady(her first trip to america) see that I have her name, she figures I'm the Uber driver ready to pick her up. She knows how to use google maps and saw we were headed in the opposite direction of her intended destination. My heart is still going 10,000 beats a minute while another car with a friend from the center and what could be the real 'Demir' pulls up. 

After a discussion that I'm not a part of takes place, the cops get me out of the car, unhand-cuff me and everyone, including the kidnapped woman, seems to be laughing....except me. I am in disbelief as of to what just happened and I definitely sweated through my entire outfit. We get back to the Turkish center and the story spread like wild fire. Everyone comes up to me with a hug, a laugh, and a drink. I got drunk drunk. 

TL;DR by picking up the wrong woman and getting arrested for kid napping. First names count, people!!!

Edit: detained, not arrested. Also, talking with Turks, they all have varying degrees of where the country resides. Eastern is too white, middle is bad in America, so most of them just say they are from Turkey.",tifu

"Me [18M] and 9 other friends [18M] on holiday in Spain. One friend won't pay for the Villa, as he came last minute as a replacement. Shall we kick him out?","Okay so it's essentially the title but I'll try to explain it as best as I can. Names have been changed. 


There are 10 of us in total. 8 of us in the Villa, and 2 have an apartment near our Villa. 


1) Harry was going to come. 


2) Harry cancelled around 1 week before we were going to come, so we didn't know until then that he wasn't going to come. 

3) Zack was going to come. 


4) Zack cancelled around 1 month before we were going to come, so we had plenty of time to find a replacement. 


5) Hank and Mark replaced them but none of us were told, one guy literally invited them out of nowhere, and none of us are that close with both of them. They both said Yes. 


6) He asked them both, even though at that time only Zack had cancelled. They both said Yes, so they decided Hank stay in the Villa, and Mark would get an apartment near us as well. 


7) Hank is replacing Zack. At this point we didn't know Harry wasn't coming. 


8) Hank is booked in for the villa, he pays all the money like everyone else (¬£240 just for Villa for 1 week). 


9) As we didn't know Harry was going to cancel, Mark books his own little apartment near to the other 2 people. 


10) Harry cancels around 1 week before we're about to leave. 


11) Without the rest of us knowing Mark refund his apartment, and decides to just stay in our villa, even though we've told the villa owner there's 7 of us only, since Harry cancelled. 


12) We had to show and sign documents showing our passports, and documentation basically to confirm there is only 7 of us staying in the villa. 


13) So, the only thing Mark has paid for is is own flight which is ¬£160. 


14) So, he needs to pay around ¬£240 for staying in the villa for 1 week, like everyone else has.
 

15) The rest of us only found out yesterday that he hasn't paid, but he's already said to 2 other people, he's not gonna pay because ""ITS EASIER FOR ME"". 


16) He goes ""I'm doing you guys a favour by taking the extra spot that Harry was gonna go on"" ?!?!?!


17) Also, basically because Harry isn't coming we all decided to do something nice and all give him the refundable deposit for the villa which was ¬£250 which means between us we are paying like ¬£35 for the deposit. By doing this we are minimising the amount of money he loses, since some of the things he paid was non-refundable.  


18) If you think about it, if Mark paid, we would all get our deposit back. But he's not, and the deposit that's going to Hank, is covering ¬£250 worth of the shit at the villa. The villa that Mark is staying at free of charge because it's ""easier"". 


19) So we are literally paying ¬£250 to Mark essentially  and he is saying ""im doing you guys a favour"". We are basically paying for his holiday, and losing money ourselves. 


20) So yeah we are going to ask him to pay later on otherwise he's not staying in the villa he can actually fuck off and find some other accommodation. Do you think that's fair? But we really don't want to put him out on the streets, but we don't know how else to get him to pay. 


21) If he says he will pay after the holiday, he literally and simply just won't, he will be lying, and after the holiday is done there's nothing that we can do really. 


22) How can we get him to pay? If he pays that means we can all get our refundable deposit back too, which is around ¬£35 per person which would be nice too. 


23) 2 people have asked him to pay already, and he told them all to Fuck Off. We know for a fact that he has the money, so that's not the issue. He himself has money in his account, and his family is also decently well off, like not poor or anything. 

EDIT : Some confusion, we are in Spain right now. It's been 3 of our 7 days. 


What can we do? HOW CAN WE GET HIM TO PAY?

Being proud of your race is lame because you had no choice of which race you are.,"People should be proud of their individual accomplishments instead of whatever they got at birth. My first assumption when someone is proud of their race is that they haven't done anything with their life so they have to latch onto the success of other people who look like them.

Edit: A couple of comments have suggested that this means you also shouldn't be proud of your family. That doesn't apply because you had a direct impact on your family as they did with you. This extends to your community. What I am speaking of is hundreds of generations before you. 

Another point I'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. Current Mongols don't need to feel ashamed of Ghengis Khan. I don't think modern Germans should be held responsible for Hitler. That also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

Edit2: Because there is some confusion, I'm not white. I actually made this post with white nationalism and Stefan Molyneux in mind. This logic should still apply to any race, gene, or whatever pre birth lottery you won/lost",unpopularopinion

TIFU by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother,"Now this TIFU didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and I am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

So, a few weeks ago I was at my GF's house, usually the plan when I go is I sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch TV, play games and other stuff. Everything was normal, I chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general TV.

This is where the fuck up happens.

After around an hour or so, me and my GF were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

I'm enjoying this more than I ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. Although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since I started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

She starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. Literally within less than 30 seconds, I'm already ready to release my load, I try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but I just can't, it feels too good. 

Right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst I'm there in my birthday suit. My girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock I release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. Not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. Her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

I sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. My girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then I hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

Although me and my GF are still together, I haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

An Update from JasonInHell,"**tl;dr** - I am doing better and I continue to get better everyday

The first thing you may notice is this is being posted from a different account, I deleted the /u/jasoninhell account in a knee jerk reaction to seeing my reddit posts in the news.

I guess the first question to answer is how am I doing, and to that I would say I am doing well. I have bad days but I would think that is to be expected. It is just important that I, or anyone going through something, continue to use the support of friends and family as well as good coping skills to not let myself be completely defeated on those bad days. I won't lie, I struggled to get back to where I am. For some time I refused to sleep because of combination of fear of what I would wake up to and nightmares about that night. For a time I used alcohol to sleep but my family loved me enough to take it from me before it became a damaging and permanent habit. I was hospitalized because I did have thoughts of ending my life because I missed my children so much. From that I learned that you should never be ashamed of your mental health and not seeking treatment will only make it worse, not better. We have all heard it but if you or a loved one is struggling seek immediate assistance, your life is too important to throw away in a moment of weakness. By putting off treatment I only caused everything else in my life to suffer. I lost my job and became reclusive to the house. But don't worry I have been back to work since December and I have nearly regained my former position and salary, so I am good and require no assistance.

The second question would be how do I feel about the sentencing. That is something that is harder to answer, because no matter what the sentence nothing will bring back my beloved children. Do I think she should have gotten the death penalty (which Indiana has), no I do not. She wanted to die and after 9 years of giving her what she wanted when she wanted it I was not going to give her another thing. Do I think the life sentence will have any appreciable effect on her? I don't know, one thing she always stressed for the entire time that I knew her was that she lived her life without any regrets. Even after I caught her cheating on me she continued to say she had no regrets.

As for the ex-in-laws, they continue to be a problem to this day. Shortly after everything happened they changed the locks on the home I was renting from them with my property still inside. After trying to civilly negotiate the return of the property it was required that I involve law enforcement. That is an ongoing legal battle. A member of the family accused me of stealing property I had purchased from them prior to the death of the children and threatened to take action against me unless I paid double what I had already paid them. I alerted the authorities and as far as I know that is resolved. They continue to make visiting my children's grave difficult, during the one year anniversary they sat in their truck and just watched me the whole time I was visiting the grave. Because of that I don't visit the grave as often as I would like to.

If I can impart on you something I have learned through all of this it is that you should always take the time to be with the ones you love. It doesn't matter if they are asking you to read The Poky Little Puppy for the millionth time or asking you to play Smash Bros even though you both know they will wipe the floor with you every time, just do it because you never know what time will be the last time. Always make sure they know how much you love them, I had the fortune that the last thing my children ever heard me say was, ""I love you, good night. I will see you in the morning""",relationship_advice

TIFU by trying to tell my parents about Jeff Epstein's suicide.,"This literally just happened and I've decided to lock myself in my room until further notice.

I was surfing through my newsfeed this morning and I happened to see news articles that Jeffrey Epstein (rot in hell) has committed suicide. Now, my family and I all talk about current events and politics. My parents were up and about getting ready for the day, so I figure I'll go tell them the news.

Their door was cracked open, so there's the fuck up. I walk in and am greeted by the sight of my mother blowing my dad. As I hear my mom say ""Do ya mind??"", I immediately walk the other way, and back downstairs to my room. All the while trying to burn away what I just saw.

They leave for the weekend at noon, and I have no plans on seeing them again this morning.

TL;DR: Jeff Epstein decided to scar me from beyond the grave.

Edit: In one hour on a throwaway, I get more karma than my 4 year old account, first time getting silver, and front page for the first time? Huh.

"It isn't ""amazing"" that a person with disabilities half-asses something able-bodied people do.","I figure this one will make me sound like a real jerk, but hear me out.

It seems like every day I see some video on Facebook with sappy music where some person with a disability performs a feat that a person with that disability doesn't typically perform. It leads to a bunch of congratulation and applause by everyone. But it never makes sense to me. 

I think creating tasks and events for someone with limitations is perfectly viable. Special Olympics? Hell yeah. The story of a blind kid being allowed to play football on a team of able-bodied kids? Come on. 

I recently saw a video of a girl with cerebral palsy who took up boxing. Cue amazement from everyone. But she's having people cater specifically to her disability, and the message is supposed to be that she overcame the odds... 

Except that all she actually does it flail around on her knees with gloves on while someone kneels down so she can hit the hand pads... Kinda. She hasn't overcome anything because she's not actually achieving a task beyond awkwardly slapping her hands about. It isn't REALLY boxing, so calling it that is kind of silly. She's still not ""normal"", and no one is fooled into believing she is. It's a spectacle, and I'm not impressed - I'm cringing. 

I once saw a video of a guy with a severe physical limitation completing an obstacle course of sorts. Except he didn't. He was pulled and carried through most of it while someone filmed the pitiful experience. There was nothing inspirational about it because nothing was ACTUALLY overcome. He just created a spectacle and inconvenienced a bunch of people who ultimately felt sorry for him. The course wasn't made for his limitations, and he accomplished nothing. 

Hell, I have severe back and nerve issues, so I can't lift much weight. Therefore, I don't work in a field that requires it, and I sometimes have my wife carry heavier items. Them's the breaks. 

And please understand, I'm not implying that I believe that people with disabilities are less of a human or that they deserve any less respect or love. But every being on the planet has built-in limitations. There's nothing wrong with living within them, and sorta-kinda doing something you can't REALLY do isn't impressive or inspirational. It's awkward. 

TLDR:

A disabled person isn't ""overcoming a disability"" by creating a spectacle and pretending they can do what able-bodied people can do, and the ""amazement"" people feel when seeing someone half-ass accomplish something like this is just a more optimistic form of pity. They're well aware that the disabled person isn't truly accomplishing the task in any realistic manner, and so is the disabled person. 

Don't pretend to be something you're not. If you can't truly accomplish a task the real way, it's not made for your limitations, and that's okay. You're still awesome.",unpopularopinion

The rainbow should belong to everyone. It represents color and art. It represents a beautiful and near-magical natural phenomenon.

I'm in grad school, but still go to the same OBGYN in my home town, out of familiarity and convenience. I was planning to switch once I finished school and settled down. I have him listed as my emergency contact. 

For some reason, they keep calling him to confirm my appointments, despite me telling them three times to never call that number and to please call my cell phone instead. Things came to a head yesterday when they called to confirm my appointment for an ultrasound and he cancelled it without my knowledge.

This has to be a HIPAA violation, right? I can't imagine they're not doing the same thing to other women. This could get someone seriously hurt, if they were seeking birth control or anything behind the back of an abusive parent/spouse.

TIFU by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today...,"When I was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. So spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and I thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  I had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
The googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until I had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out I pushed it even further in. I was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. I could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, I stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. After a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

Skip forward to this Tuesday;
I do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and I was submerged under water, after I emerged and pulled my boat out I could hear a slight rattle in my ear and I knew instantly what it was.
It's now Friday and the rattling happens every time I turn my head and I still haven't build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.

TLDR: Put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... It didn't

TIFU by receiving 2nd degree burns on my butthole.,"So this happened roughly about 4 hours ago. Insert generic ""I'm on mobile"" text here. 

So I was getting ready for work and stepping out of the shower.
I don't know about you guys, but I really like to use a hair dryer on
every part of my body. I've got hair all over my body, so it makes sense I guess.

I use the hairdryer to dry my (head) hair, then my torso and then my legs... and then...
my butt. You see, I'm a guy and there's some hair down there. It's not always
easy to dry it with a towel so I just use the hair dryer. 

I would get out of the shower, use a towel to dry myself as much as possible 
and then let the hair dryer do the rest.

For the last 10 years this technique has worked PERFECTLY FINE.. except for today.

You see, somehow my hands were still wet. For some reason I didn't notice this. So
while I was spreading my butt cheeks to dry the hair between them the hair dryer slipped
out of my hand. I quickly cought the power cable but by doing that the hair dryer was rammed
directly between my buttcheeks while it was STILL ON.

The hair dryer was on the highest setting and the moment it hit my butthole I was shocked.
I instantly clenched my buttcheeks together while the hairdryer was still in there and running.

God, I can't tell you how much this fucking hurt. It still does. It's literally the worst pain.
Like, I know the anus is relatively sensitive but this was just PURE HELL. The pain was so horrible
I was literally unable to loosen my butt cheeks. The hairdryer was blowing hot, and I mean HOT air directly on my butthole
for about 7 full seconds. I managed to get my shit together and pull the plug.

But by the time I pulled the plug the damage was already done. I fell on the floor and puked all over
the place. The pain was unbearable. I was crying, screaming and I think I even might've passed out for
a couple of seconds at a time.

I was laying on my bathroom floor for 30 miniutes trying to somehow live through this immeasurable pain.

It was horrible. But after half an hour of laying there I realized I had to move, this had to be treated, so I tried to reach for my phone to call help. But when I tried to crawl to my phone I realized that the hair dryer was STILL
between my butt cheeks!

So I tried to pull it out and that was the second time I puked due to the pain. When I got it out it was covered
in bloody/burnt off parts of my butt's flesh. I have no clue how it looks down there but it can't be any better than
how I'm feeling right now.

I eventually managed to call my girlfriend. She drove me to the hospital.

So... that's basically it. I'm currently laying in a hospital bed. The wound has been 'treated'. It was so humiliating.
The pain is still horrible but they gave me painkillers so I guess that'll help.
This is literally the worst day of my life. I've not only felt the WORST pain you can imagine, I've also never been
more embarrassed/ashamed.

But I really have to give credit to the nurses/doctor who treated me. They did perfect. They tried to cheer me up
and they were totally nice. I'm so grateful.

Also, I really hope I could explain this properly but if you had problems here's a visual depiction of what went down:

Took Husband To ER For Possible Stroke and He Got 5150/What Can I Do?,"This is a long story because a lot happened and is still happening.

We live in Seattle. My father in law died suddenly and we flew down to Northern CA to deal with that. We decided to drive back. On the way, my husband started to say that he didn't feel right. His heart was racing, his face felt weird. He was on little sleep dealing with his family and we hadn't been eating great because of everything going on so this man who is normally pretty chill got flat out terrified that he was having a stroke.

We work for a pretty big and well known non-profit health care provider that pushes the whole kind of better safe than sorry thing when it comes to your health so...I googled the closest ER and went to it.

We got there and, by this time, I'm pretty sure he's having a panic attack. He's not violent or threatening or anything, just really really scared he's about to die like his father to the point that he's making sure I know he doesn't want to be cremated.

I tell the check in person that he thinks he's having a stroke and I think it's a panic attack but I'm more worried about his heart. They check him in, he gets the code for the bathroom and goes to the bathroom. (In other words, he's not threatening anyone, he's not trying to kill himself, he's not unable to take care of himself.)

After he's available, the nurse takes him for triage. His blood pressure is 188/100, which is NOT normal for him. I tell the nurse this and that I'm very scared about what that means. She just shrugged it off. She asked him his height and weight and he answered. Then she started to ask him all these mental health questions. When she would, he would look at me because...what the hell does that have to do with anything right now? His blood pressure is not right.

So I answer these questions to the best of my ability while pointing out his physical symptoms were a very big concern.

They take us back to what they call their ER Overflow. It ends up being psych. My husband keeps asking why he's there. They take that as he's unaware of his surroundings. He does as they ask and changes and such because it was pretty clear they had no intention of letting us leave.

He's not put in a room, just a cot with a curtain in a line of cots with curtains. We look around and notice things like...their trash bins are just Lowe's Lawn and Leaf bags and they keep patient charts in three ring binders on a desk and they're accessible to anyone in the room.

Where we work, the standard is you secure everything in a computer and patient information is guarded like state secrets. When dealing with patients, our medical staff asks them multiple identifiers no matter how many conversations they've had with that person before new information or new medical stuff has to happen.

These people came up to my husband and just said his first name then started to talk to him like they'd been friends for years. He refused. He let them know we expect a certain level of patient safety and we're not getting it. If they don't ask him his last name and birthday every time, he's not talking to them.

They took that and wrote it down as, ""Paranoid.""

I explained to them the medical world we come from. They said it doesn't matter. They do things differently so the fact that he can't fall in line is an issue. They kept the ""Paranoid.""

Eventually, they got him a televisit with a psychiatrist but wouldn't tell us much about where this psychiatrist is based out of or anything. When he pops onto the screen, he just says his name and that's it. It looks like he's in his living room.

Again, this is NOT what we are used to.

The psychiatrist asks my husband his name and his date of birth. My husband refuses to answer. He didn't agree to this, he doesn't feel medically safe, he doesn't trust what's going on. The psychiatrist spends all of five minutes not really trying and calls it a day.

At this point, I'm not worried my husband is having a stroke, but I am worried his heart is going to explode because of how they are treating him and how they're not even touching on HIS concern that he's having a stroke. He started to beg me to not let them let him die. Then he started to try to go through at least the physical tests for signs of a stroke. The staff looked at him like he was this super sad insane guy and decided he needed Ativan. Because *I* was worried about his heart and I know the doctors I work with in my job prescribe it for some patients to feel ok with being in an MRI machine, I talked him into taking it in hopes that he would at least not care that he's so worried about having a stroke.

Eventually, we hear back that the psychiatrist on the TV who spent five minutes with my silent husband has decided he's bipolar, is having an episode, and needs a 24hour hold and anti-psychotic medication. 

What?!

So they start planning for him to be there for 24 hours.

I try to fight them, but they shut me down every step of the way.

Meanwhile, the Ativan is making my husband loopy. I look it up and...oh... it can cause hallucinations. Spiffy. This is going to help our case.

The night wears on and they try to get my husband to take Zyprexa. At this point, the Ativan is wearing off but he's ok. He asks them if there's side effects with Zyprexa. They laugh and shrug. All drugs have side effects according to the nurse. He declines to take it. They tell him they can't trust him to be released if he can't follow medical staff direction. He asks again if the medication is safe. They assure him it is. He reluctantly takes it.

A couple of months ago, his PCP back home prescribed him Prozac. Seattle gets funky around this time of year and, with him being from CA, the change in seasons can be hard. There's a lot of SAD in the area from the CA transplants. His doctor wanted to be proactive.

This hospital KNEW he was on Prozac.

They declined to tell us that Prozac and Zyprexa actually CAN interact.

And, of course, it did.

So now he's SUPER out of it, talking nonesense, suddenly becomes worried that he's peed himself. They try to take blood from him and his blood is so jacked they barely get anything. And everything just starts to to downhill from there. Eventually, they feel like I'm asking too many questions and being disruptive and kick me out then put him on a 5150 and he's been stuck there with no clear way out. I talked to the mental health person that put the 5150 in motion and she would not budge. She was adamant that my safety was in jeopardy. I told her I'm not scared of my husband and, that, once they stop giving him those meds, he won't have the symptoms he's having. She stated that she can't because of his paranoia that his identity is going to be stolen. I pointed to the OPEN BINDERS ON THE DESK of patient information and said, ""You're handing it out to people here. He's completely justified."" But they do it differently and, because he can't file in line with that, it's a really big issue. They had no intention of letting him go.

Keep in mind, too, they'd ask, ""You have XYZ insurance, right?"" before deciding what sorts of things they're going to throw at him. He has excellent insurance.

This is a small rundown of what I know has been done to my husband:

They have ""accidentally"" given him his Prozac prescription twice a day when he just takes a dose once a day. They keep giving him the Zyprexa on top of it and he keeps having side effects.

I have seen NO paperwork about anything happening to him. No consent forms. Nothing. When I asked for a copy of the 5150, first they couldn't find it then they said I need to ask Medical records. It's the weekend. This place is dead on the week outside of the ER. Not happening.

I got in contact with our home medical team. The doctor in charge of his care told our RN he's not talking to her and hung up. (Our RN is now working on putting him through the wringer.)

They refused to let me see him for an entire day. I'm going to try to see him today, but I'll probably get escorted out again. I'm walking a fine line of not getting out right banned from the hospital.

There is no patient advocate in staff, no ombudsman. No social worker.

All the lawyers in town take the weekend off so I can't get a lawyer. I talked to my police team back home because they're good people and they suggested I call the police here to do a wellfare  check. The police here wouldn't do it.

I brought my husband in for a stroke and now they're giving him meds he didn't really agree to take, his reaction to those meds are giving them a medical excuse to not release him, and no one here will help me.

What do I do? How do I get him out?

UPDATE
I'm getting a lot of the same responses about certain things so I'd like to add:

We work in health care. The place where we work requires at least two patient identifiers before we are even allowed to start talking to the patient. I get that it's probably not standard in most of the country, but our high level of care that receive from our company isn't either. We calmly explained why we balked. They couldn't humor him. The more zombie they make him the more his extensive training for his job makes him silent. Like we say, if we haven't pissed you off making sure you're you then we haven't done our job.

My husband has signed that I can know his medical stuff and make medical decisions on his behalf.

He thought he was having a stroke and no one was addressing those concerns so he was scared he might die from a stroke. I work with Neurology patients. His reaction was not inconsistent with my experience.

Part of our situation is stemming from we are used to X level of care and professionalism and, apparently, that's an anomaly. But, no, I'm not going to let him be penalized because he expects a certain standard that all people should expect. When we spoke to our personal medical staff about the reasonableness of him keeping quiet because they don't do what we do, they consistently say they wouldn't talk either because that's not safe.

There are ways for staff to validate the staff from other medical facilities.

We are working on getting a lawyer. I called them and they won't say anything past he's sleeping and that he's not allowed visitors.

UPDATE

They have *lost* the forms he signed giving me clearance to speak on his behalf and cut off communication.  His mother contacted them and they told her that he has been re-evaluated and his hold has been extended another 72 hours they state because he is unresponsive and suicidal. His first hold went into effect 12/7/2018 at 12:22PM.  Today is not 72 hours.  There was no hearing that we know of.  His mother got them to let me call them.  I called him.  He stated that he wants to live, but he needs help.  I asked him with what.  He stated that he's too weak to feed himself and get himself water and they won't help him with that and he feels like he's starving.  I did tell him to ask them so let's hope that happens.

Edit to add: He has been getting up to wander around loopy and the guards rush him and grab him to bring him back to his bed. There's no warning. He tenses from being startled then lets them lead him around like a puppet. They call this aggressive behavior from him. Maybe that is aggressive in an ER. In a normal world, that's not. And just because something has been a certain way for a while doesn't mean it's right. It might just mean no one has said anything.

I also do not think my husband isn't ill and I don't have any issue with him having a mental illness.  He's my husband and that's not going to change.  I just want him in a better care facility closer to home and they are not letting me do that. Since their beds are so full, you'd think they'd jump at it. 

Further Edit: 

I was driving. We had stopped for a moment and he stated he was worried, can we go to a hospital.

For the first 36 hours, I didn't say anything and let him handle it for the most part while I did everything they asked without complaint, but when we got there it was shift change and he had about ten different people in and out. 

His blood was not flowing well and his veins had shrunk. It was jacked up. 

The RN trying to get through was using the official lines as her job is patient transport and care tracking. The hospital would not speak to her to set up care tracking and transfer. 

His doctor prescribed him Prozac because he went to her and said he was feeling off with the season change. She wasn't ready quite yet to diagnose SAD but prescribed the medication to see if that makes a difference.

The area he's in is technically just ER Overflow and there isn't an actual psych ward area. They just put a privacy screen up as a barracade in an area with extra cots.

I asked them to humor him. They said they don't do things that way. He still jumped through their hoops, just informed them he didn't think it professional every time. Once he got to know the person, he didn't do it. It was just when it was someone new. Since he hasn't had the same team twice yet, there's always someone new.

AITA for telling my friend's husband about her secret food stash?,"Background: I have this friend Mandy who I guess what you'd call ""militantly obese."" She has claimed in the past that it's a civil rights issue and that she is ""genetically fat"" just like people are ""genetically black"" (her words, not mind but you can see her mindset). 

Recently Mandy's husband said enough is enough is enough and told her that if she didn't at least make and effort to change he was leaving. Mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being ""anofher link in the chain."" 

This was about January and Mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and Mandy has actually gained weight. Mandy was using this as ""proof"" that her issue was genetic. 

I was helping Mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge Tupperware bin the back of her suv. I assumed she wanted it unloaded but as I moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. I asked her about it. She got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. I asked her if this why she's gaining weight. She told me to fuck off. I texted her husband because in the heat of the moment I was furious she had spoken to me like that.

Her husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so Mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce. Mandy is blaming me, am I the asshole here?


Edit: I accept my judgment and I won't delete but the comments have taken a ridiculous turn and I don't want to he part of this anymore. No I don't want to have sex with him. Nor did I ever imply or infer that. Enjoy your day.


Edit 2: based on some responses that said I was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which I accept) I called and told Mandy that I was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. She said that I am just another person oppressing her and that even the Avengers were oppressing her these days. I asked her what she meant (won't spoil the movie) but I explained to her that I was acting out of frustration and Avengers is just a movie and now I was really concerned. She said I could take my concern and shove it up my ass and we're done and hung up and has apparently blocked my number. Thank you for participating but I think it's a dead subject at this point.

[USA-NY] 24 year old male. My doctor called and told my mother he treated my genital warts,"I had one genital wart removed and my insurance covered it fully. Later my doctor kept pushing for a skin biopsy on my chest that was completely irrelevant to my genital wart. 
I finally agreed and signed the paper after he told me how risky it could be for cancer. He performed the procedure but the nurse forgot to verify that the insurance is covering it. I understand I need to pay because I signed paperwork saying I'd be responsible if my insurance didn't pay. 

However he called my mother introducing himself as the doctor who treated my genital warts. Then he goes on to tell her he needs a few thousand dollars for the procedure. 

Is that even legal? I thought he wasn't allowed to reveal another condition unless it comes down to the insurance not paying. 

I literally told the doctor my family couldn't know about the wart and he tried to use it against me to scare me and my mom into paying immediately. My insurance kicked me off for doing so many unnecessary procedures with this guy. He would convince me everything could potentially be cancerous. 

I understand it's my fault for not doing my research and being gullible so I'll have to pay for that. However I'm pretty upset he had to tell my mom about my STI condition when there was no issue with the billing. He was paid and it was done over a year ago. It was completely irrelevant to his call to collect. He called to collect from a skin biopsy of a mole on my chest. 

I'm so frustrated because now my family thinks I'm a guy living with aids and I sleep with dirty hookers.

I got a long splinter under my fingernail all the way to the end of the nail bed while pulling weeds on the job. It was only my 5th shift (although second week) working there. I ended up having to go to the ER to get it surgically removed, lots of fun getting multiple shots in my finger. 

I'm given a ""workers compensation verification form"" to bring to my employer. I was supposed to work the next morning, so I went ahead and contacted her, telling her I'd bring the form. She starts telling me that I never signed a W9 so I'm not actually an employee and she's not actually liable. I've already been paid by her once. She goes on to say I never told her and that I'm just making accusations, even though I had told her about it the morning after it occurred, and she had acknowledged it multiple times throughout the day.

After searching a few state databases, the only business license she has under her name is one for real estate, and no record of workers comp coverage. Looking back on it, I think the hospital staff discovered this as well but were going to let me figure that out.

AITA for keeping a gift solely for my son rather than splitting it between him and my girlfriend's kids?,"I've been with my girlfriend for four years now.  I have a son from a previous relationship and she has two children of her own from her's.  My son is turning 18 very shortly and will be graduating.  Her children are 12 and 14.  

Pretty much since my son was born I've put aside money for him in a separate bank account.  When I first started I was never able to add much to it, but I worked my ass off and made sacrifices in order to be able to put in what I could.  It now has over $40k in it.  I've been shooting for an even 50, but came up short.  Still I'm proud that all my hard work and sacrifices are about to pay off for him.  I've daydreamed about being able to do this for him too many times to count.  

My girlfriend knew about the account. There have been some hard times in our relationship where using some of the money would have made things easier, but it was always a hard line for me not to touch it.  She was never happy about it per say, but would eventually respect my decision.   Now that my son will soon be graduating however we've come to a point where we are unable move past.   She doesn't want me to give the full amount to my son, she wants to split it three ways between all of the children and to give her children their thirds when they graduate. 

We are a great team usually.  It's almost unheard of for us not to be able to work through issues and come to an agreement so this is sort of new territory for us as neither is willing to budge on this issue so far.  She's fighting dirty too, she's been making it out as if I don't really love her children. At least not as much as my son.  I do love her kids.  That's not in question, but the truth is of course I love my son more.  I feel like that shouldn't even be that controversial of a thought.  I truly doubt she loves my son as much as her own children even if she'd never admit it. 

I honestly don't even know if I would be able to split it up even if I chose too.  This is been something I broke my back over and gave up things for myself for for almost 18 years now.  Even thinking about splitting it up is difficult for me.  Inside there's just a big ""NO"" feeling that comes up when I try to consider it. 

I also feel like it's really shitty for my girlfriend to make this such a demand.  Putting this money aside was never easy and she had no part in that.  In fact she did pretty much the opposite putting herself into debt(which I now help pay off) and I don't particularly feel that she should have deciding power over this money. 

Neither of us have been backing down and it won't be too much longer until it's time to give him the money.  ",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by unintentionally giving my friend a masturbation alert,"So after five months of doing this shit I realized today that this has been happening.

Before this happened I was unaware incognito mode on Chrome was a thing. Because of this every time I would go to a certain NSFW website I would type the link into a Discord (basically the new Skype) direct message to my friend that lives across the country. I only send the links to him while it said he is offline. I did this so my Chrome wouldn't save the keystrokes of whatever website I decided to visit that day and show up in the predictive search. I would then click on the link of the website through Discord and delete the message. Little did I know that my friend has Discord notifications that show up on his phone for whenever he receives a message. He basically had an alert for every time I masturbated.

So after I had been doing this for a while he finally decides to ask me why he receives all of these NSFW links in the middle of the day. I start laughing out of embarrassment because of these notifications he's been receiving. I told him about the whole process I go through just to get to a website. After that he proceeds to laugh for a good few minutes and tell me about incognito mode on Chrome as my embarrassment keeps rising. After more laughing we moved on.  

I'm glad to know about incognito mode though I will probably keep doing it has I have been because I'm used to it and it's a great inside joke.   


TL;DR: I have been sending NSFW links to my friend on Discord for the past five months while he isn't online to avoid predictive search. He has Discord notifications enabled on his phone therefore giving him an alert every time I masturbate .",tifu
Neighbor threatening to sue over wheelchair ramp,"My boyfriend has mobility issues and uses either a wheelchair or crutches depending on his pain levels. I've done a lot of home improvement projects to ensure he can get around my house easily, including a wheelchair ramp up to my front door.

"[CA] While on vacation, my landlord came into the house, locked my cat up without food, water, and litter box for at least 3-4 days. Cat is ok, just a lot skinnier. We are breaking the lease to move out, is there any chance we can get our deposit back? Landlord lives overseas.","San Francisco, CA

Hello, as the title stated, my landlord came by when we were on vacation (we knew about it), and started complaining about the house. One of the complaints was that the cat was roaming the house freely. We texted him and said that if you are locking up the cat, make sure she had her water, food, and litter box. 

We came home to the doors closed, and cat was in a room without any of the three essentials.  She clawed the carpet trying to get out, peed and pood everywhere, and most importantly, visibly skinnier. Cat doesn't usually hang out in that room by herself, coupled with the landlord's complaint about her, we suspect he did it on purpose even though he insisted it was an accident. He is overseas now.

We don't really want the headache of pursuing legal action - cat is fine, just need to eat more, and we just want to move out asap and leave this behind us. Is here anything we can leverage to keep our deposit? Deposit is one month's rent.

Edits: Luci is really ok. Her appetite is much smaller now than before so we will spoil her with wet food for the next few days. Vet said play with her more to build up an appetite.

We don't want to sue for personal reasons. The landlord said they will pay for the damages of the room. 

The lease says if we move out we have to pay for all the remaining months' rent. We just want to say ""hey, this is the law, so we should get our deposit back, and not pay for the remaining months."" Should we get a lawyer to write up something?

The landlord's complaints of the house weren't legit. They were about a dirty mug on our desk, us using a 100ft cable along the wall (stuck neatly to the wall with adhesive) to reroute the internet from the living room into the bedroom, detergent residue in the detergent dish of our washer, a blanket on the sofa, some amazon boxes by the hallway, and other trivial things, you get the idea.",legaladvice
AITA for propositioning a girl in the gym?,"Please hear me out before you judge because while I did say what you're thinking I didn't say it in the way you're thinking.

The gym I go to is very small. Not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. This means working out fairly close to people even if you don't mean to. Yesterday I (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (One would do a set while the other waited beside them) The girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend ""Ugh I hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.""

I shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. I was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so I'm not entirely sure if it's an actual well known exercise) 

The same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf ""Look there she goes again, and her forms terrible."" Which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

At this point I call her out. I said ""Oi, you."" She immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. So I called her out again specifically ""You in the purple top."" 

She turned round and asked what I wanted. The following conversation happens:

Me; Do you want to fuck me?
Her: What?!
Me: I said do you want to fuck me?
Her: What the fuck is wrong with you?
Me: Well you keep staring at me, so I'm assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

She went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. I carried on with my workout and didn't see them again.

When I told my friend what happened, he said I acted like a dick and that as a woman I should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. He also pointed out that I embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

My defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn't talk shit if she doesn't want called out on it.

TIFU As a Reaction to Butt Worms (almost certainly NSFW),"This is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.

Also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

For background: At some point in my childhood, I developed pin-worms. In the interest of science, I must admit that I don't know for certain that I had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that I had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

I'm afraid that I don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all I remember is that as a young child I walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and I don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

Fast forward a decade and a half: I am living on my own. Single. Re-Acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone I am still close to refers to as ""She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"". I don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....I had worms. My butt was beyond-normally itchy. Sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. The confirmation came when I showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

I hoped they would go away. I showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. But every morning, I would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

I was horrified, but I made an appointment at my local clinic. When I told the nurse over the phone that I thought I had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. She said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

I went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in Sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly South-East Indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

I was already frustrated, but I waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. Later I drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before I would get results.

In the meantime, I remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.

I would like to say that as a liberal American male, I wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that I did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, I dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what I had done.

Now to add: I had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. We had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; I wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and I found ourselves showering. My hand drifted down to my butt-crack and I realized I \*NEEDED\* to share my story with her, despite fears that I would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. So I spurted it out: ""Uhm, so yeah, I...uh...think I have butt worms....""

She was so practical about it. She asked to see. I pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""See,"" I said, embarrassed. ""Worms.""

...

""That's toilet paper"", she replied.

""W...what?""

""Yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""That's toilet paper.""

Everything fell into place. About a month ago, when finances got tight, I swapped my normal TP roll with Dollar Store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after I wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

My relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . My shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

TLDR: I spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because I bought cheap toilet paper.

WIBTA if I canceled my nephew's college fund over his rudeness?,"My wife and I have been married for 12 years, and the nephew in question is my brother's oldest son, who I'll call Michael for this post. Michael is 16 and the oldest of my brother's two boys. 

Michael was a baby when my wife and I got together, and she has always treated him and my brother's other son like family, just the same as she treats her own siblings' kids. My wife has a significant inheritance and we both earn generous wages, and it was her idea to open college savings accounts for Michael and his brother when they were babies. This is likely to be the only family money for college they'll receive.

Anyway, the story: last weekend, my brother and the boys came over for dinner and we all had a nice time, though the youngest one was on his Switch the whole time and Michael was on his phone. I didn't think anything of it until the following Tuesday, when I found my wife sobbing after work and she showed me an Instagram post made by Michael, who apparently is too stupid to realize we BOTH follow him (as do his grandparents). 

He posted a picture of my wife from behind and a picture he apparently took of her underwear laid out on our bed, both mocking her size (she is overweight) and calling her a 'big bitch' among other things. My wife was devastated and humiliated and hurt, because she's always had a good relationship with him.

I'm furious and want to cancel his college savings account right now, taxes be damned. My wife says she'd be too embarrassed to do this since she's an adult and shouldn't be so hurt by a child, and just wants to pretend it didn't happen. I already told his dad and let his dad deal with it at home, but I'm still furious and want to cancel the account Monday.

"I was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the DA finally got around to my case. I did nothing wrong.","Okay, so a few days ago I was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. I lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

I was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (I'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest I didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something I did not do). I had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where I was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. I'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything I told him to at this appearance I had because a simple background check shows I don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened I was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). He literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (Judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

So then I sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. I tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper I had but he was never in and never came to see me. I couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. I don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, I was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because I can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months I'm about to owe.

When he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the DA who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter I mailed them until then also. After that appearance I got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and I was released.

What can I do for any of this? Apparently someone with the same name but a different DOB shot a building after a fight and is a felon but I sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless I pay some crazy fees (how am I liable for these fees if it was a error?!).

"[NYC] We made a child protective services report on another tenant in our building, and now they and their extended family (who rent multiple units) are acting menacing towards us. We had to get a police escort out of our apartment this morning. What rights/recourse do we have?","Around 2 this morning, we heard the babies crying across the hall and the parents shouting at them and what sounded like them being hit through our vents. We called the police, and they said they'd send ACS within 24 hours. They showed up around 5 am, buzzing our apartment to be let in, and came up to talk to my wife (who made the call), and then they started speaking with other apartments and the one across the hall that we reported. Many of the apartments are rented by the same extended family (at least 3 out of 8 but I think more than that), so they all found out, of course, and when we were getting ready to leave, they were all out screaming in the hall. My wife called a police escort to get her out of the building, and even they were flustered, and said that we should call them whenever we're entering or leaving. Clearly, this isn't sustainable. This is a family that has had the cops called before for domestic disputes (one of the men was choking one of the women out in front of the building one night) and for quality of life reports (smoking in the building, loud parties on weeknights that go to the early morning, etc.), and apparently they've been in the building for a few decades.

We signed our year sublease beginning October 1st, so we obviously need to break our lease early. My wife got a hotel for the time being, and is afraid to return to the building, but I'll still need to return to pack everything and get it moved. Do we have a right to get our security deposit back? Are there any other steps we should take? It's unlikely that all of the units could be evicted (though I wouldn't be surprised if the landlord would be happy to, seeing as he could likely raise the rent on the units significantly), so no matter what, we'd be unsafe in the building.",legaladvice
(Kansas) Renters buried fetus in my backyard,"So like the title says I rent a property in Kansas and my renters had a miscarriage and buried the unborn fetus in my backyard. Some background I'm terminally ill and currently living in Colorado waiting on a transplant. I decided to rent the house I own in my hometown. I had a roommate when I lived there and when I moved he offered to rent the whole house. This was a couple years ago. Since then he has gotten married and had a child. They were expecting their second earlier this year and apparently had a miscarriage. I should say these people, although my friends, are pretty trashy but overall pleasant enough. Around the time of their miscarriage they started having trouble paying rent and after a few months decided to move out. I'm currently in town for other reasons and decided to go look at the property and talk to them about life and whatnot. The wife then told me about the miscarriage and then told me they buried the fetus in the backyard. I was shocked and just kind of left without too much of a reaction. Now that I've gained my composure I'm worried that maybe this could potentially cause me legal trouble. What is my liability? What if a dog digs it up or something?

TIFU By Accepting a Proposition for a Threesome,"Obligatory this didn't happen today, it happened last summer. Newly obligatory this will not end in incest. I didn't accidentally eat out my cousin or half-sister or whatever dumbass erotica you're all posting lately. Obligatory TL;DR at bottom.

&#x200B;

It's a perfect summer night in 2018. I'm leaving a job that I hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm's reach. I turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 AM,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.

&#x200B;

Last call rings out, the bar is mobbed. I lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (MAG) who approaches me shortly after. She's equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. She's celebrating a friend's birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.

&#x200B;

MAG is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the BMI chart, leading me to believe I'm being hit with a bait and switch. They SWIFTLY disprove that theory by literally asking if I ""want both"" of them. Worth noting that this is the only time I've been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so I jumped at the chance.

&#x200B;

Next thing I know, we're in a cab on the way back to whoever's house the birthday pregame was. There is alcohol EVERYWHERE. They're feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it's my last day on earth. Some girl is crying on the couch.

&#x200B;

My drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl's sorrow. Having been recently broken up with, I know exactly where her head is at. Having done far too many shots, I am not scared to console this crying stranger. Soon I will be the Advice Champion, and fuck every girl in the house.

&#x200B;

I launch into my speech, hitting every point she so desperately needs to hear:

* You're so much better than him.
* He *OBVIOUSLY* doesn't deserve you.
* You'll look back and laugh at this in a month.

&#x200B;

I'm now starting to notice that the cheers and applause I was waiting for are actually all death stares, even a few dropped jaws. As it turns out, this girl's boyfriend didn't break up with her. 

&#x200B;

No, he fucking ***DIED.***

&#x200B;

The guy died in a car accident and I'm telling her she'll be laughing about it in a month. Nobody fucked anybody that night.

&#x200B;

TIFU when I read my mom's recipes,"Throwaway because there's just no way I'm immortalizing this shit on my actual Reddit account. 

This morning my mom messaged me to ask if I could come over and update the antivirus software on her PC. I agreed to drop in when I'm done working.

Fast forward to me appearing in front of my mom's computer, initiating the update process, and proceeding to do nothing but stare at the progress bar. While I was doing that, my mom proceeded to prepare dinner. 

The update was taking forever so I decided to kill time by bringing necessary order to my mom's desktop. It was a mess. Dozens of random folders scattered across the screen in no particular order whatsoever. I couldn't even see the fucking wallpaper. It was enough to summon the OCDemon buried inside of me and clean up the clutter. 

So, as I was organizing my mom's shit, I noticed a folder called ""Mom's Recipes"". Now, as a guy who's dating a girl who loves a man who can cook, this folder peaked my interest. I figured it wouldn't hurt skimming over some of my mom's recipes and perhaps surprising the girlfriend with an unexpected home cooked meal.

I opened the recipe folder and clicked on the word document inside. Now, I'll be honest, I'm not the world's most intelligent person, but when I see the words ""mom"" and ""recipes"", I imagine wholesome family dinners and shit. NOT...

""I'm a woman, I'm a widow, I'm a mother, I'm over 50, and I'm still the whore next door""

This was the fucking opening line to my mom's so called ""recipes"". It was an ominous sign that I should not read any fucking further. I read further. It became clear to me my mom's recipes had nothing to do with how to cook, but rather how to fuck. I made it through the first two pages before the ""recipe book"" went into graphic detail about what my mom's preferences were when it comes to size of the dick going into her mouth and vagina versus the size of the dick going into her ass. 

I closed the document, finished the update, and got the fuck away from that computer. My mom invited me stay for dinner but I declined. All I could see was different sized dicks entering my mother everywhere. I think I need to end our relationship now.

UPDATE My (23m) girlfriend (21f) wants me to use a massive toy on her during sex but I feel uncomfortable,"EDIT obligatory link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgd49d/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_use_a_massive/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So I added this to the original post yesterday but I felt like a lot of people who saw the original probably didn't see the update, so here it is in it's own post.

So I woke up this morning to a post with over 400 comments and had a minor panic attack. I called my girlfriend and when she got to me she insisted that I tell her why I was so panicked. Reluctantly I showed her my post. 

We've spent the past few hours discussing and going through the comments on the post. I think it's safe to say that we have come to a mutual understanding. 

First of all, what I picked up from her. I didn't really know why she wanted me to use it on her (although I had guessed she probably wasn't dissatisfied with the size of my penis) and so I found out that she wasn't wanting it for any sort of sensory reason, what she finds arousing about it is seeing how much she can fit in her. I also found out some other fetishes she hadn't introduced yet. 

What she found out was that my problem was not with her actually calling me inadequate but that it made me feel inadequate, not that anyone had done anything wrong but it was just my emotions about it. 

What we both learned about me is that I have a pretty deep rooted fear of inadequacy. From this to the fact that I go to the gym for multiple hours seven days a week because I was a fat kid who felt undeserving of attention from girls, to my height (5'6). That's something that I need to work on, but it isn't something that will be fixed by me using the toy on her even though I feel uncomfortable. 

So now the all important part where I tell you the decision we came to. We decided that we would explore other fetishes she has that don't give me the same feelings for now and this is something that we may revisit down the road at my discretion when I feel like I've worked through the root issue enough. 

TL;DR we aren't using it for now, but it may be revisited when I've figured out the root problem of my emotions regarding it.

EDIT Shout out to the people acting like not doing one sexual act is going to lead to an unfulfilling sex life for my girlfriend.

I was born in South Africa but emigrated when I was just a few months old so I am totally American. I come from a family of full on Apartheid supporters and when it ended, basically everyone bailed for America. My parents and aunts and uncles eventually were educated and came around but my grandparents, while being very sweet and loving to me, were true believers in what apartheid stood for. They made a small fortune in South Africa by literally investing and owning businesses in the apartheid era. To be totally fair, they also made a ton of money in the US, but still the money because they were white and well connected in South Africa. 

My grandmother died recently. She lived pretty lavishly up until the day she died in a very exclusive retirement home in SoCal so I figured there wouldn't be any money left and maybe I'd get some family heirlooms. My head about popped off when I saw the number me and my cousin will split (it's about $725,000 each). Money that will literally change my life. 

My parents business failed so I wasn't nearly as well off as my cousin. She's also now married, lives in Rancho Santa Fe (google it if you aren't familiar) and will be just fine without this money. She claims she's going to donate 100% of it to charities in South Africa. She is seriously chiding me that *if* I plan on keeping it, then I am taking advantage of blood money built on racism. 

I have student loans I could pay off, I could actually have a down payment on a house, I could invest, I mean...I know where this money came from but it could literally mean my life would be better. I understand where it came from but I also can't possibly imagine giving it away. I have no idea what charities are like in South Africa and family friends we have that still live there say that corruption has taken over everything from government to charities and I'm better off just keeping it.

TIFU By Losing a Butt Plug [NSFW],"This happened about 20 min ago.

So last night my girlfriend and I decided to go out to the bars. Got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. Recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. Well last night was the first time we decided to use them. We read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. Everything went well but afterwards we couldn't find the plug. This is where the TIFU begins. 

We figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. Woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. GFs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she's a little extra hungover no big deal. We arrive at McDs to get some greasy hangover food. I order while GF heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. As i take our order back to our table, GF walks over in a panic saying we need to leave NOW.

She found the butt plug. In our drunken state, we managed to put the ENTIRE thing in her ass. Handle and all. And now it's sitting at the bottom of a McDonalds toilet in all its glory.

UPDATE: Today I came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from,"Delaware, USA

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/d9t0ez/today_i_came_home_to_a_new_fence_in_my_backyard/)

I found the fence on Thursday. Saturday I was having about a dozen people over for a family birthday party so the eyesore of a fence had to go, one way or another. So on Friday morning, I had a follow-up call with the realtor who knew nothing about the fence, and he told me that the homeowner didn't either. I called my neighborhood civil council president to let him know about it, and he told me about encroachment issues (as the fence was on my property), but also let me know that in my city, a permit is not required to build this type of fence.

I took many commenters' advice and installed security cameras around my house, two of which have either full or partial view of the neighboring backyard.

I also took to heart the idea that there may be squatters living or preparing to live in the house next door. If I find anything on my security cameras indicating there may be squatters, I'll be informing the police.

So, on Friday afternoon, I removed the fencing in its multiple different pieces and gently leaned them against the brick garage, with the exception of one door-sized section, which I put against the basement door in case there are indeed squatters entering through there. Saturday, Sunday, and Monday came and went without any indication that the yard was entered again, and the fencing over the basement door hasn't moved.

We still don't know who built the fence or why, but it doesn't seem like anyone cares, and at least now I don't have an abomination of a fence to stare at anymore. I will likely build my own fence though, one that looks good and is structurally sound, and that spans my property line.

Thanks to everyone for your input and advice, and if I learn who built the fence I will be sure to update again!",legaladvice

Tl;dr of previous post\- My next door neighbor is absolutely convinced I have a pet bird and has made complaints to the HOA, animal control, and the police because my supposed pet bird is so loud it is causing emotional distress.

I got another complaint from the head guy running the HOA that my \(now multiple\) birds are causing severe emotional distress to my neighbors and their children, who can't sleep at night because of my ""flock"" of birds. The wife sent a recording to him as proof of my bird\(s\), and to tell him to tell me my smoke alarm is also beeping and needs the batteries replaced because they can hear it from their unit as well. 

Now, you can clearly hear a smoke alarm beeping, as well as birds chirping on the recording. However, the beeping is coming from their unit, as I can faintly hear it if I press my ear to the shared wall. And the birds that are supposedly my pets? The ones that are so loud that their whole household can't sleep and it's causing severe emotional distress? THOSE ARE THE BIRDS OUTSIDE. IT'S LITERALLY THE CHIRPING OF THE BIRDS OUTSIDE THEY'RE HEARING. Now, I'm no Disney princess, so I have no effect on wild birds\- or imaginary pet birds\- for that matter. I mean, my singing is so terrible it actually scares them away.  And I'm not sure how any person that is not a complete moron would mistake ordinary bird chirping for ""a flock of loud, abused rain forest birds"".

I've sent a letter to the HOA telling them to kindly pound sand and stop harassing me over the wild birds that I have no control over. I'm also going to record the birds from my porch and from inside the condo so if they say I have birds again I can prove that it's just ordinary outside birds making reasonable outside bird noises.  I'm looking into get a bird feeder as well, because it's allowed by the HOA covenants and fuck these people for being utter imbeciles and blaming me for the natural behaviour of wild animals. 

Now I'm just going to sit and wait for the next problem they have with me,  because I don't think these nitwits will take kindly to being proven wrong over something so stupid.",legaladvice

"UPDATE Neighbors off leash dog attacks and injures my dog, sister, and myself. Now she's trying to sue me. We're the ones with 29k in medical bills. NC USA","Here's a link to the original post. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/aoovyg/neighbors_off_leash_dog_attacks_and_injures_my/?st=JSCE6BW3&sh=7f56780f


My sister and I spent the weekend after I posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
The guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
He is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

Ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

The neighbors mean dog has been put down.  She was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

We've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

Our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

She was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
One from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  I'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

One for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

Her lawsuit against me has a court date of March 5th.  After she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   She then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

She finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

Our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in NC where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

Now for some extra facts. 

My left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on February 27th. 

Our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  The vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  She still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

The destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

The day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  She broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  She straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  She also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

We called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. They asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

Our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

The video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  It shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. It also shows her audibly laughing during it. She only started trying to help when I started smashing her dog into the ground. 

We also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the HOA. 

He said it's pointless to go after the HOA and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  Our lawyer did tell us that the HOA has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

There was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

I honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

Either way, my sister and I both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of March. 

Thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. You guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

I'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  Please feel free to ask any questions and I'll answer whatever I can.

AITA for telling my niece she should wear deodorant?,"My niece is 12. She's going through puberty. 

I pick her up from school or dance practice sometimes when her parents are working. 

I've noticed over the last few weeks she's been smelling very ripe. 

I was driving her home one day and said (this is abridged) ""Hey I know you're going through a lot of bodily changes right now and you're really growing up. I think it might be time to start wearing deodorant.""

She said ""I smell?"" And I said ""Yah, just a little. No big deal. Just pick up some deodorant, your mom has some."" 

Her parents called and were furious saying she's going through a difficult and sensitive time and how dare I make her insecure about her natural bodily functions. 

I said ""Sorry, I thought if roles were reversed I'd want someone to tell me. Are you really saying you didn't notice her smelling like BO all the time?"" 

They said she had to come to them and ask for it because someone pushing the issue would make her insecure. And by circumventing her psychological timeline I've given her a complex for the rest of her adolescence, maybe beyond. 
 
I didn't think it was a big deal at all, but now my niece and her parents are so upset, I feel awful!  I'm wondering what I missed here. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
A Mexican man who spoke no English went into a department store to buy socks.,"He found his way to the menswear department where a young lady offered to help him.

""Well, these shirts are on sale this week,"" declared the salesgirl.

""No, no quiero camisas. Quiero calcetines,"" repeated the man.

""I still don't know what you're trying to say. We have some fine pants on this rack,"" offered the salesgirl.

""No, no quiero pantalones. Quiero calcetines,"" insisted the man.

UPDATE: AITA for refusing to apologise to my sister?,"[ORIGINAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/beaaz7/aita_for_refusing_to_apologise_to_my_sister/)

So my sister's wedding was today. I took the advice of people here and apologised to keep the peace/make things easier for my mum, but told her that my partner and I are kind of a package deal and that either both of us come or neither of us do. She stuck to her guns and said that my partner wasn't welcome, at first maintaining that it was because of his tattoos and then eventually getting emotional and yelling at me that he wasn't allowed after ""what he'd done to her"", which confirms my theory that it was because he rejected her years ago. I just calmly kept telling her that if she didn't want him to come then fine, but not to expect me either. 

I guess she thought I wasn't being serious, because I got a call from my mum shortly before the ceremony was due to start asking where I was. I told her I wasn't coming. I got a *lot* of rather abusive texts from my stepfather, telling me he always knew I was worthless but this was a new level, as well as some direct threats. I ignored them all, though I did text mum and apologise for causing problems but I *did* inform my sister I wouldn't be going. Culminated about an hour ago with my stepfather and now brother in law showing up drunk at my flat and trying to fight me while my sister cried outside. They got removed by building security, and honestly it was more funny than anything to me. Apparently I've ruined her wedding day, but I'm really struggling to care. Maybe that makes me now the asshole, I can accept that. 

Just thought I would share this update, since I posted about it here initially.

ETA: clarifying a couple of things that people seem confused on.

First the whole ""she got rejected by my boyfriend"" thing. This one is my fault, I thought I'd included the story in my original post but looking back it was actually in the comments, so apologies for any confusion there! Essentially what happened is that about 6 years ago, when he was 17 and she was 26, she propositioned him for sex (~~don't blame her he's hot as fuck~~ that was a poorly worded joke that fell flat, striking it out since some of y'all got triggered) and was told no. She's held a grudge ever since - I think, in part, because she was told no for pretty much the first time in her life and also later because he chose to get with me when he'd said he wasn't interested i her. He was fully out at the time she propositioned him and she was definitely aware he was gay. 

Second, some people are seemingly confused and thinking this whole thing was a one off incident that led to me not going to the wedding/wanting to lessen/cut contact with her. This is not the case and is again probably due to a lack of communication on my part so again, apologies. I'll clear up that we've *never* has a good relationship, and she's been pretty cruel to the point it could be considered emotionally abusive to me since I was very small. She's also been physically abusive at several points throughout my life. This is not a debate of me placing my relationship over my family but, rather, one of me finally taking up for myself after years of being a pushover and the aftermath it's caused.",AmItheAsshole

I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I don't know what to say to her.,"Hey everyone. I don't know what to do in this situation because I never expected I'd face something like this. I'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but I'm coming up seriously short here.

I met my wife on Tinder at the end of 2015. We talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. By the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. We were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. More than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

I know, heavy topics for a first date. We were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

At the very least I held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. Her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. She immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

We dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. After getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

Four nights ago was the first time I ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. My wife was out with a friend, and I was doing some house cleaning. I was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so I took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. At the bottom I saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case B were visible. I immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

I had known that my wife was on her period because when I tried to initiate sex, she told me so. I found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and I made comment about the timing being odd. She told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. I figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

I haven't told her that I found the box. When she got home that night everything was so normal. I tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

The more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. What if she was assaulted? What if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? What if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? Or, what if she just cheated? I only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of Plan B and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

I don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. We have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. I've done nothing to displease her, at least that I know of. Maybe I'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than I'm giving it credit for. But I feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because I don't know how.

**tl;dr** I found a torn up Plan B box in my trash. The only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. How do I bring this up?",relationship_advice
Kid reached over the wall and filmed my daughter while she was crying in a bathroom stall at school (6th grade) in Texas. The kid then posted the video to social media.,"That happened about two weeks ago.  It was initially pushed down to a guidance counselor as a ""friends issue"".  My wife went to the school about a week ago because the issue had yet to be resolved; a group of girls were still picking on our daughter.  Since then, one the assistant principals conducted an investigation.  The girl that did the recording is still running around the campus with her phone, and now our daughter is labeled a snitch and bullied even more because of the way the school has handled it.

Needless to say, we're a bit pissed.  Our daughter won't be going back to that school.  We're not really sure what to do next.  Do any of you fine folks out there have any advice on a way ahead?

Edit: Forgot to mention two important details:
1. The kid that did the recording...she admitted to doing it in a written statement to the school. She denied posting it to social media, but other kids have told our daughter they saw the video posted on music.ly.

AITA for Telling My Wife to Get Out of Bed and Feed the Damn Cat.,"Alright everyone, I need some judgement on this one...

My wife and I have a happy, healthy (no chonkers) cat that we love except for on weekends when he will sit outside our bedroom door and meow non stop until one of us gets up to feed him. This only happens on weekends.

Monday-Friday my wife wakes up for work first at around 6:00 am and feeds the cat. However on weekends we both try to sleep in, so come 6:01 am our kitty alarm clock goes off and won't shut up until one of us gets up to feed him. He will literally cry for 2 hours straight if we try to ignore him.

Here's where the story takes a twist. Awhile back we bought a timed self feeder to use when we are away for vacations. When we tested out the self feeder we discovered the amazing benefit of the cat no longer crying to us for food because he gets fed at his usual time each morning. I thought this was fabulous and we should use the self feeder all the time to save our sleep sanity.

My wife disagreed. Her reasons range from:

Concerned that the self feeder might not drop the correct amount of food each time.

Concerned the cat might be able to reach his little murder mitten up the food chute and steal extra food between meals.

Concerned the cat won't ""love"" us anymore since we aren't the ones directly pouring his food into his dish.

Concerned it's a waste of batteries.

I've told my wife I understand all of her concerns but I still think the benefit of being able to sleep in without being woken up by a cat banshee outweighs the risks she has laid out. She still disagrees.

So I did the only thing that reddit hates more in relationships than cheating and gave my wife an ULTIMATUM! 

I told her that we either use the self-feeder or come 6:01 am Saturday morning when the cat wakes us both up, I'm kicking her (not litterally) out of bed to go feed the damn cat.

So reddit, AITA?

EDIT: I'm seeing a lot of people proposing the compromise of using the self feeder just on weekends. Unfortunately my wife has shot that idea down in the past too.

EDIT 2: Many people have been demanding I pay the ""cat tax"" and post a picture of the real AH in question. Sadly I am a Reddit failure and can't figure out how to attach a picture to the post. If anyone knows how to do this and can direct message me, I will gladly comply and pay the cat tax.

"Should I tell my(27f) little ""sister""(12f) that I'm actually her mother.","I saw the post of the 14yo kid who wanted his mother to love him and it just melted my heart. It actually made me write this. I'm in a somewhat similar situation.

I had my daughter when I was 15. I was assaulted and chose to keep the baby. My parents felt that it would be better if she was raised as my sibling rather than my child. They wanted me to go to college and get a degree. After years of therapy and hard work I have a decent job though I'm still afraid to date anyone. 

My parents died in an accident and I have full custody of her. I love her so much but she still thinks I'm her sister. It kills me when she calks me sis. I feel like I'm missing a lot. I want to tell her. But my best friend thinks that it would only complicate things and she cannot handle such sensitive info at her age. What do I do??

AITA for changing my mind midway through buying a stranger coffee?,"I stopped by a local coffee place after work today. There was a woman behind me in line with a toddler, the kid was sweet and saying ""hello"" to everyone in line and genuinely brightened my day. 

While I was standing near the cash register waiting for my order, the woman stepped up and ordered a $4 coffee. I kindly offered to pay and she seemed so grateful and even thanked me twice. Right after, she turned back to the cashier and said, ""in that case, you can add two extra shots and a blueberry muffin.""

I was so taken aback, I immediately told the cashier that I changed my mind and she could pay for her own order. I walked over, picked up my drink and left without another word. 

AITA for reneging on my offer? 

Edit: I want to thank everyone so much for responding. The only thing I'd like to clarify is that I felt bad about it afterwards. She could have intended to pay for the add-ons, it could have been a joke, etc. I didn't communicate with her very well because I fell into a trap of assuming the worst.

We need to let some pet breeds die out.,"We have destroyed what were once great creatures by selective breeding, and we need to let some of our ""creations"" die out.

Breeders don't give a shit about your car or dog, they don't care if they die years earlier than they should, or if they're prone to more diseases and health issues, they care about is your cash.

Of course I don't mean all breeds of animals when I say they should be bred out, but here are some examples of breeds I do mean:

French Bulldogs, Pugs, and other brachycephalic dog breeds: These dogs are often characterised as cute, with flat faces, but this causes their problems. Being bred to a point that their skulls are the wrong shape, causing lots of health problems, most notably breathing issues.

Munchkin Cats: Munchkin cats are dwarf cats, sausage cats, whatever you want to call them, are genetically bred to be dwarfs. If they had no health risks, I still think this is cruelty to cats, as it restricts what they were capable of. But, they have been reported to have higher instances of pectus excavatum (Hollowed chest), and lordosis (Curved spine).

This isn't even hard to achieve. Simply put a ban on breeders breeding these types of animals, and spay / neuter all the ones that are already owned / being sold.

But I doubt we'll do this for a long time, because so many people adore their horribly deformed pets that have resulted from shitty breeders.

Edit: I posted this very early in the morning, I know I wrote ""car"", but I did not mean that! I think I meant cat.

TIFU by blowing my man too enthusiastically [NSFW],"This happened the past night, technically already today.

We were having some adult fun with the boyfriend. It was also after a couple of drinks so we were going at it pretty rough.
So here I am, on my knees, giving him a blowjob, putting my back into it when all of a sudden I hear a very loud *POP* immediately followed by one of the worst pain I ever felt. It felt as if someone stabbed me in the face with a screwdriver. 

Thanks to my godlike reflexes I was able to yank my head away from the one eyed yogurt slinger before my teeth snapped together and with that momentum I also managed to slam my head into the nearest wall. I was already in tears from the shock of the sudden pain when I realised.. I can't move my jaw. I started to panic and just kept repeating ""I can't open my mouth! I can't open my mouth!"".

We tried to pry it open while under hot water, thinking it was a muscle cramp but that shortly, with some pain I can't even start to describe, revealed that it indeed was not just some stiff muscle... 

Yup, I managed to dislocate my jaw while giving a blowjob.

In a futile attempt to snap it back where it belongs, I tried punching myself in the face on the opposite side, tried pushing it, pulling it with all my might but none of that seemed to work. At the end after many tears and pain and panicked running in circles, I took a painkiller and wrapped myself in a blanket to think through my options. I ended up falling asleep like that for a few hours. 

When I woke again, with the pain a bit duller and my mind a bit clearer I finally managed to pop my jaw back where it belongs but the pain is still very bad and I can't open my mouth more then to fit a teaspoon neither can I close it completely. It being Sunday, only emergency trauma care is accessible in the hospital and it is insanely crowded so I decided to wait till tomorrow to seek medical attention. So here I am now, popping painkillers and eating my dinner with a straw, having absolutely no idea what I am going to say to the doctor or how do I explain to my boss why I need a day off in such short notice.

Tl,Dr: i went for a blowjob, ended up like the T-Rex after King Kong was done with it.

EDIT/UPDATE: first of all... Holy sh** this blew up! I'm glad I could make so many of you chuckle. Also, I've read the comments, thanks for the laughs, it hurt.

To answer a couple topics I found in the comments: sadly, nobody came that day. 

What was boyfriend doing, well, he tried to call an ambulance after he realised we are not equipped to fix the issue. Problem is, my country is not very big on English and my boyfriend doesn't speak the local language. First operator hang up on him when realised he is trying to communicate in English, second operator got stuck on not understanding the address code in English... I then insisted to ""f**k that, it'll be fine"".

I am not from the us, just very stupid. Health care is included in taxes but did not rush to the ER because they are under staffed, under payed and over worked an I was not bleeding, seriously disabled or in mortal danger, neither did I think a dislocated jaw is serious enough to require immediate care, tho reading your horror stories and warnings made me concerned.

After a brief ~4 hours spent at the clinic I was called into a large room where five dentists were working on five different patients with not as much as a curtain separating them so the place was loud enough that the doctor did not ask questions because I was not able to answer loud enough. He instructed me to grip the chair tight because it will hurt, pushed my jaw backwards and wiggled it to it's place. Showed me how to stretch the muscles, gave me his number and sent me off.

Hopefully it will heal alright and I can go back to finish what I was doing originally.

American Colleges shouldn't force you to take classes irrelevant to your career path.,"According to my understanding, most of the world doesnt require you to have an undergraduate degree to go into medical school, with their medical school just being 6 years long. In america, to become be in a medical career, you need 8 years of school vs the 6 years at other countries. 


In those 8 years of school, I must take philosophy, sociology, and speech to get an undergraduate in biology. There are *some* classes you can wriggle an argument for, like physics 1 or writing, but probably not physics 2 or speech.



Saying ""colleges just want to make you well rounded"" makes you sound like (and I hate using this term) a sheep. To my understanding, American colleges were more identical to the rest of the world's some time ago. (Not 100% sure on that) So, by saying that colleges want to make you more well-rounded is like saying previous generations of STEM field grads weren't (*or even grads from other countries that is*).  Taking philosophy for 1 semester isn't going to turn my life upside down, not 90¬∞, not 45¬∞, not even 1¬∞.


Edit: ok, I understand and agree that philosophy is important. However, learning that other countries do not require 8 years of education to be in a medical field, makes me irritated at my beloved country. I just used philosophy as pet peeve to get a point across. 1 semester of a particular liberal art feels more like an excuse to siphon money, especially if it is considered vital for an undergraduate that is completely irrelevant. Hell, my school has bio ethics, I haven't taken it yet but that seems like a lovely way to possibly blend philosophy and biology, keeping it relevant. 
 

It honestly feels like colleges just want our money, at the expense of the student's lives. Allowing students 2 more years in their 20s (ideally) and less debt to deal with, can save them so many more problems.",unpopularopinion

He also said that it's a turn off that I slept with him on the first date and he's surprised that he like me because of this. 

He said something about it being instinctual for guys to want to sleep with a lot of girl and a status thing, which is why it makes it okay for him to have that history and not me.

Muslim guy [22M] whom I [22F] multiply rejected over the years writes to my friends to find out about my virginity,"We have been attending the same university over the last 6 years and share a lot of common friends.

During the first year of uni, he has asked me out and I declined. During the years, I have tried my best to stay away (as much as possible), however, he interpreted every accident glance as my approval of his advances. I guess, in total, I had to decline him about 10 times or so.

However, during last summer I had made a mistake by replying him on one of his messages (just asking how I am). We have talked a little, and that's all. Soon after I had stumbled upon him near my house. I confronted him again, he denied following me. After that I told him to stay away and blocked him in all social media.

It all has been silent until last month. Two weeks ago my best friend told me he wrote her, directly asking  her if I have ever been in a physical relationship with a man. She didn't answer him except asking why on earth does he want to know such personal information. He did not reply.

Today he wrote to her again, demanding a link to my (hypothetical) boyfriend' profile.

I lost my wits, wrote to him again, telling him to leave me and my friends in peace. He denied writing to my best friend, which is absolutely foolish. I have ranted and once again blocked him.

However, I do not believe this is the end. I am angry at such intrusion in my personal life and a little scared for my safety. I mentioned his religion because he came to our city from southern regions with very ""tradiotional"" views upon marriage and female consent.

He never seemed dangerous or violent in university, just a little slow to understand.

AITA - Mad at my wife for throwing away pendant from previous marriage,"I'm really upset with my wife after what she's done, but everyone of our friends/family thinks she is right to do what  she did. So I'm posting here to get an unbiased perspective.

I've been married to my current wife for three years. We dated for 2 years before getting married. Before meeting my current wife I had been married to my ""high school sweetheart"" for well over a decade.

My late wife passed away very young from breast cancer. It was an extremely traumatic experience for me, and I didn't start dating again for several years after the fact. I never had any real relationships before her (parents were both physically abusive, siblings absent) so it was especially hard on me.

I've always had a momento from my previous marriage. It was a greenstone/pounamu toki pendant. She gave it to me for our first wedding anniversary. Before meeting my current wife I would wear it almost 24/7, going through several strings.

When I met my current wife she wasn't comfortable with me wearing it since it was from my late wife. So I started wearing it less often but made it clear to her it's an extremely important item to me. For a time she accepted that until recently.

Over the past few months whenever we had a minor disagreement, she'd bring up my pendant and then turn it into a shouting match demanding I get rid of it. I can understand why she might feel uncomfortable with me having it, but I had stopped wearing it at this point, it stays in my draw 24/7... Why can't she accept it's very important to me?

Long story short, when I was at work last week she grabbed the pendant and threw it in a nearby river. When I found out I broke down because it was literally the last thing I had to remember my late wife.

 I don't know. Maybe I am not respecting her feelings and holding on to the past. AITA?

*UPDATE* textbook scam,"Good news! I posted a week or so ago about a company that sent me a different textbook then the one in the photo, and claimed the international version was  specified in the description. Then was demanding me send it to Malaysia for return, which would have cost as much as the book (the book was over $100). I sent many emails, then they did not respond for a couple days, conveniently those couple days were the last couple days in the 'refund time', meaning the book was no longer eligible for a refund. To say the least I was not happy. My bank said they could not do anything (I was given that advice on here), so I researched the Canadian Government on consumer laws. Shortly after this I had reported this company to the consumer laws in my district. They replied with 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention', and within 5 hours I recieved an email from the company with a full refund, and with the book still sitting on my table.

Have to say, it feels good",legaladvice

&#x200B;

I said I'd come back if anything relevant happened!

&#x200B;

EX-BF kept trying to get in touch through common friends. They kept asking me to unblock him and at least hear him out, cause he was really sorry, he loved me, he was a mess, he didn't mean to, someone even went as far as to ask me if I was really sure it happened. They offered to send me prints of texts where he was talking about me, so I'd see how he always had great things to say and how much he cared. But I've had it with the print screen drama for life, and said no. To the ones who insisted I told them I wasn't unblocking him, had nothing to say or hear, and if they kept pushing me, I'd block them too.

I ran into EX BF at this book thing I go to often (hobby of mine). Maybe I'm being presumptuous, but I think he went there for me. He didn't really have any business there, but I'm just speculating really. He asked if I had a few minutes for coffee, I said I was late (lie). He walked me to my car. He looked so good, smelled great. He was so sweet. Was even wearing his hair the way I like it. I fell horrible cause even after everything, I still like him. He apologized some more, said he knew I needed time and space but asked if I'd consider giving him another chance cause he would wait for me. Said he would never talk to Jessie again, and would act like they had restraining orders against each other. And I just found it really funny how everything he was saying required me trusting him. Which I don't. So I told him I wasn't interested anymore and he should move on. I wish I said something snappier or wittier. But I had nothing.

This was saturday, I haven't heard from him or friends since. I think that was that. 

&#x200B;

Jessie also kept trying to talk to me. Like I told some of you on comments, I had a trip coming up, it would have been me, Jessie, EX BF, and a few friends. Since Jessie couldn't afford it, my parents payed for most of her expenses. She must have remembered this right after everything went down and panicked cause I had everything (vouchers, confirmations emails, credit card info...). She went CRAZY. Even showed up at my place (I wasn't home and my roommate told her to fuck off, exact words). I didn't block her at first cause I admit I was having some fun watching her despair.

I talked to my mom and she was amazing. Told me I should cancel everything even if it costed us money, it was fine. So I did. And for one last bit of print screen drama: I printed all the emails I got confirming cancellations and sent those to Jessie with the word ""bye"" before blocking her.

&#x200B;

My roommate has been amazing. We were never really close and now I don't even know why. She cancelled plans with her friends to stay with me and invited me to go out with them next weekend.

&#x200B;

A few of you suggested I see a therapist and I did, yesterday. I really liked it. It was just one appointment and I mostly just talked, but it felt good. She gave me ""homework"": she talked a little about unhealthy and abusive relationships and asked me to think about my friendship with Jessie and try to point what was healthy and what was unhealthy about it. Made me realize she was never really my friend. She was taking advantage of me for years and she even had me thanking her for it. Therapist also told me about this saying (I think that's what it is) called ""The Narcissist's Prayer"", which goes something like ""That didn't happen. If it did, it wasn't my fault. If it was, I didn't mean it. And if I did, then you deserved it"", which is totally how Jessie is handling this whole thing now.

So good riddance indeed

&#x200B;

And a final piece of gossip. ""Pete"" talked to me yesterday (he is checking up sometimes, he's a good guy. Again, he is gay, in case someone is still thinking this might turn into a romantic comedy) he said Jessie was super sure that since I broke things off, she and Dean would hook up right away. But apparently he doesn't have the same plans and that freaked her out over the weekend. Pete says he really is a mess and went out drinking hard 4 nights in a row to the point he had to be carried home by his pals. And yesterday, they all went out for lunch at this burger place, Jessie was going to run her fingers through his hair or something and he just pushed her away and told her to stop and to never touch him again. (Great that **now** he manages to do that, huh?)

I guess in the end he really did like me in his sick way. The thing is, I don't want to be with someone who likes me in a sick way. I want to be with someone who likes me in a healthy way. I thin I deserve that.

&#x200B;

I am also thinking about taking the money I got back from the trip to go somewhere else by myself. Haven't decided though.

&#x200B;

Anyway, this will be the final update on this, since it is unlikely that I will have anything new to add

Now, I think I just need time to heal and let go, you know?

I might come back in a few months if there is reason to do a ""yay life is awesome now"" post, but I wanted to post this update now cause I wanted to end this whole story on a bright note. And, of course, thank you all again!! You are the best!!

Was my dad really grooming me or am I overreacting?,"Hey reddit. I need your help! My (21F) father (61M) has had a very strange relationship with me my whole life. I don't live with my family anymore due to university so this isn't affecting me currently, but I am having a hard time processing it. I had another dream about it last night and I cannot bare to keep questioning these horrible thoughts anymore. Am I being stupid or is this serious?

There are little pieces of evidence that have amounted to me wondering if I had been treated wrongly by my dad. Weirdly, a lot of things don't add up and I don't want to accuse my father of anything in case I'm being over dramatic. But there have been occasions where I have known that my dad did things to me that weren't necessarily normal but I didn't say anything. 

My dad doesn't really like my brother. At all. In fact he barely talks to him unless he's getting in trouble. He loved me though. He absolutely adored me. And I adored him too. I never felt uneasy or unsafe around him. Even though he did some weird things to me. There was always something a little bit off. Even when I was little, I just had this weird gut feeling about his relationship with me. He isn't my biological dad, my real dad ran away to New Zealand when he found out my mum was pregnant with me. That's a whole other story, I have actually spoken to him since. He has three of his own kids now. 

My mum and ""dad"" met when my mum was trying to sell her house. I was only a baby at the time. One of the weird things about my relationship with my dad is that I have told lies to make him seem like he is my biological father. I don't know why I do that. It's not that I'm ashamed about him not being my real father. But I feel that maybe if I lied enough I would convince myself that he IS my real dad, and real dads don't touch their real daughters in that way. 

I distinctly having a conversation with my mum about how mum and dad met. This was the first time my tummy ever churned in regards to my dad. She said at the time they met, she hadn't washed in a few days, was struggling with post natal depression and was a single mother. She says she didn't look good whatsoever. To the point where she was so shocked that my dad had asked her out on a date, she worried that it was because of me. My dad was a really good looking man. He was very successful with the ladies. I don't know whether my mum was so insecure that she couldn't believe he would ask her out, or if she has secretly had her own gut feelings. ""What do you mean, to do with me?"" I asked. I was about 13 or 14 at the time. ""Well, I was worried that your dad might have been with me to get to you. Paedophiles come in all shapes and sizes."" I think I'll remember her saying the word paedophile until the day I die. I felt so physically sick at her saying that but it is something I think about on a daily basis. 

That's when a lot of things came flooding through into my memories. I never used to wipe after going for a pee. When I was about 8 years old I was in the bath and mum was watching me. We were discussing about toilet habits and I told her I didn't wipe. ""Why not?"" She said. ""It really hurts when I do"" my mum looked alarmed. ""What do you mean?"" I shrugged it off ""I don't know, it just hurts when I touch down there."" I think my mum was concerned but I don't think she ever found out a reason for it. But I do still remember it being tender when I tried to wipe. I can't remember when it all started. When mum was away on nightshift, he would make me sleep in the bed with him. I honestly can't say if anything happened. He would spoon me. But I don't know if anything else occurred. When my mum was on nightshift, she would get home after my dad went to work, and while she was sleeping, I would take my brother and I out. We would ""run away from home"". I was always such a well behaved girl. But my behaviour got so bad during that time that my mum broke down and told me she would put me in care because she couldn't deal with me. I remember being the problem child very vividly. It's one of the only parts of my childhood I remember. My mum had severe depression at that time too. She was actually put into counselling because I think she tried to take her life. Nobody has spoken about it but I do remember her having to get taken to this place. Which I later learned was a psychiatric hospital. I don't remember any of the time she was away but obviously it was my dad looking after us. 

Fast forward a few years and I have began puberty. I was struggling with my body image like most girls were and I was very confused about everything. I was late getting my period, I was a late bloomer and was teased pretty badly at school by both girls and boys. I have vivid memories of my dad telling me that I have a lovely figure. He squeezed my boobs and my waist and my bum on multiple occasions. ""You're soft in all the places men love women to be soft in."" I was in my school uniform the majority of the time he did it. I looked him dead in the eyes as if to say ""what the fuck are you doing?"" But he always laughed. It really embarrassed me. And most of all I was uncomfortable when he did it. He was supposed to be the one keeping me safe and yet he was the one that made me feel the most humiliated. However, I never felt daunted if I had to spend time alone with him. I didn't feel unsafe APART from when he did touch me. But I have read that one symptom of trauma is not remembering much of your childhood, and I really struggle to remember many memories of both childhood and high school. This could be a coincidence however. 

There were multiple instances where he would slap me on the bum, make me sit on his knee (as a 14/15 year old) and touch my thighs or my bum or my boobs. He would love giving me massages, and would take off my bra. I specifically remember one time I asked my mum if she could rub my back because it was really sore. I took off my bra and hit the ground as quickly as I could to avoid either of my parents seeing my boobs. My dad remarked ""Christ, you have a big set of tits now"". In front of me and my mum. It embarrassed me so much. In a moment of anger I snapped at him ""why the fuck were you even looking?"" Why would your dad WANT to see your boobs?? My mum repeated what I said to him too, which surprised me. I assume she was taken aback by it. Nothing more was ever said. 

Throughout mostly my teenage hood my dad was very hands on with me. I noticed this when I realised that my friends dads weren't nearly as touchy with their daughters. I thought my dad was just showing me affection. As teenagers do, I became aware of masturbating and it became a massive hobby for me. On multiple occasions, my dad walked in on me. And didn't make any attempts to leave. There was a few times I near enough shat myself because I noticed him peering through the crack in the door. Out of panic, I pulled up my pants and ran over to the door and opened it. It was him stood there. ""Yes?"" Was all I managed to blubber out. Then he walked away like nothing had happened. I hadn't heard him coming up the creeky stairs on any of the occasions. 

For some strange reason, and I really don't know if this is paranoia or not, but I always felt overwhelmingly scared that come my 16th birthday he would try and take things further than just inappropriate touching. I have no idea why. Again I don't know if I'm overreacting. I had a boyfriend at this point and dad then became very distant with me. I did however think it was strange that if I knocked on the bathroom door to tell him to let me know when he's out the bath so I can brush my teeth, he would tell me to come in anyway. And he would be there, naked, in the bath. Not trying to hide anything. I don't know if that's normal or not in a household? Throughout this time he did keep touching me inappropriately but again I didn't feel scared in his presence APART from when he did touch me on the odd occasion. 

I think the biggest situation that sticks out in my mind was when I had broken up with my boyfriend and was about to begin university. I asked my dad if he could crack my back as he was the heaviest in my family and always managed to. Mum and my brother we're both in bed. He then asked, ""do you want me to give you a massage"" I shrugged and said alright. I took off my top and he did my back for a while. Nothing weird happened. But then he took off my pyjama bottoms and my pants without even asking. He started rubbing my bum cheeks and my thighs as I laid there in shocked silence. He then proceeded to rub my vagina from behind and my bum hole. At one point he spread apart my bum cheeks to, I suppose ""inspect"" my ""area"". I was absolutely mortified. He did this for about 10 minutes or so. That was the only hard evidence I have for him properly inappropriately touching me. I thought this was going to be the time he raped me. I thought all those years of being scared about turning 16 were finally rational, as horrible as it sounds. I was now 17 but had been with my boyfriend since before I was 16. So my dad hadnt been as full on with the touching. I laid completely still. I didn't tell him to stop. I was so embarrassed. But at the same time I didn't want to embarrass him by telling him it was wrong. So I just let him and hoped nothing would progress. It was the most uncomfortable and ashamed I had ever felt in my life at that point. The only time he spoke to me was to say ""you're very hairy aren't you"" which added to the awkward and embarrassing situation. I never ever told anyone about it. 

I didn't tell a soul about my fathers actions towards me the whole time it happened. I continue and have since the age of about 12 had dreams about my father having sex with me. In all of the dreams, I enjoy it and want it. This confuses me even greater. I feel extremely lost and embarrassed and so utterly ashamed of myself. I'm scared that I'm overreacting with this. I don't want to accuse him of anything. I love my dad but it's no doubt that he is mentally ill. I am not angry at him, I actually feel very sorry for him. This is more for my peace of mind. I just don't want to be confused anymore. And I keep dreaming about it and it's terrifying me that it is a reality.  If anyone would be able to make sense of all this I would be eternally grateful. Thank you so much for listening, it's taken great courage. 

Edit: I cannot thank everyone enough for their kind words. It was extremely hard to write but whilst writing I was actually able to process a lot of it. I am in the process of replying to everyone who has sent me messages, I didn't expect this to blow up at all. When I began receiving the first couple of replies I did have a big cry. I was hoping to myself I was being extremely stupid and I had been overthinking about it all. First thing on Monday, I am ringing a counsellor. That is for certain. I am extremely wary about telling my mum but I'm going to see how I get on with therapy. I know it's the right thing to do, but part of me is thinking that ignorance is bliss. I dont want to tear my family apart. These feelings may change if/when I begin to open up. I'm extremely lucky that I have a loving and understanding boyfriend who unfortunately has also suffered from child abuse. He has had therapy for his and is urging me to do the same (for my diagnosed depression- it's probably linked to all of this tbh). He's the first person I'm going to tell in person. I actually wanted to tell him but I thought a reddit opinion would either tell me to cop on or realise that it was as serious as my gut feeling told me. Unfortunately it was the latter. If this has taught me anything, it's that yeah there are horrible cruel people, but you strangers have shown me kindness. I can't thank you all enough <3",relationship_advice
Update: Landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. Good news!,"Well, here's my update! And with good news!

So first of all, I just wanted to say: wow. The amount of support I received, both in replies and in PMs, was absolutely amazing. Everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. The person who said ""Sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

That said - I feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). He's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. He grew up in rural (Arkansas, I think? That or Alabama) and came to MA later in life. This was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. That, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

I know some of you were hoping I'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, I decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

Yesterday I sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. Everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. He realized VERY quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. He also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. He just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

We ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if I weren't having the conversation with him I'd think he were a caricature). He's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so I think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". He seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. I reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

He still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. He seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. He agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which I will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

The past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. If things go well, I might even potentially renew the lease come September. I'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but I think I'll leave the issue where it lies for now. If this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, I'll go at him with everything I can in the future - but for now I'm satisfied. I'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",legaladvice
AITA for not wanting to break up with my girlfriend/stepsister?,"First of all, I know how that sounds, but it's really not like that.

My girlfriend and I were childhood friends turned high school/college sweethearts. We are both 20 now and have been dating since we were 14. We are both commuter students at the same state college, so we still live at home. The same home. Because our parents are married.

It's my mom and her dad. Both divorced when they met, you can imagine the rest. When we were in HS we begged them not to date because of exactly this reason. Weirdly enough, while they were just dating they were totally fine with my girlfriend and I being together, but it pretty much changed immediately when they got married last year and moved in together.

Honestly, I hate being in this situation. Even though I know there is nothing wrong with us, it needles me every time my mom says ""go tell your sister x"". I think she is doing it on purpose to get under my skin. My (real) dad thinks the situation is hilarious and his view basically boils down to ""What did you expect from the crazy bitch?"" But I see him infrequently and our living situation would be very bad if we moved in with him (drugs) so that isn't an option. My girlfriend's bio mom has not been in the picture for her whole life, so that's not an option either. We can't afford to get our own place until we graduate.

This living situation is driving us crazy, but we want to ride it out until we've graduated and have jobs and can get our own place, or a place with roommates. Our parents have become laser focused on breaking us up, calling us brother and sister at every opportunity and lecturing us about how disgusting it is, asking us aren't we embarrassed that our friends know, saying that it's not anyone's fault that they got married first and this is just the way it has to be. I love this girl and have spent my life with her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I just can't stomach breaking up when *we* are fine and it is this bizarre outside circumstance trying to drive a wedge between us.

"[IA] My father left my 3y/o daughter about $500k in a trust, ex-husband (who lives in MN) wants to use the trust funds for living expenses","My father left my daughter, who is 3, about $500k in a trust. The trustee is not a family member, but a professional trustee. My daughter is supposed to begin receiving the money at 25, but they explained that they have the power to dispense money early for the right circumstances, like a private school or medical bills - or, as they very loosely and briefly mentioned, basic living costs in an emergency hardship situation. They gave an example that if I were to become ill and unable to work, the trust could provide some level of assistance to ensure my daughter does has food on her plate and a roof over her head. However this was glossed over pretty quickly and I don't know the technical details.

About two months ago my ex husband quit his job because he said they are unwilling to be flexible with him for his debilitating migraines (his employer told me that he claims to have migraines but has never actually seen a doctor about them for treatment), and says he has been unable to find a new job and intends to instead pursue getting on disability, but expects that to take 2-3 years. He says that he will soon lose his apartment. He is unable to receive most government-based assistance because he scammed the system last year (lied about income to receive food assistance for which he was not qualified and got caught).

So, he has now approached the trustee and wants to use the trust money to pay for an apartment, utilities and a car until he is approved for disability. I was especially surprised about the car portion - he says he needs money to purchase a safer vehicle because his vehicle is old, rated poorly for crashes and does not have working seatbelts (which is a surprise to me - just a few weeks ago I buckled her into the back seat when he picked her up, so not sure what exactly he is claiming there).

I disagree with this use of the funds, particularly because he only has her for 6 days per month. I understood the ability to use the trust for living expenses should be limited to scenarios in which she is genuinely in danger of being homeless or neglected, and that is not the case as I provide everything she needs now and can do so all the time if he is unable to. My father intended the money to provide her with opportunities once she is old enough to use it wisely, not to facilitate my husband's visitation in our custody agreement.

Since my ex husband has a history of committing fraud when receiving government assistance and also a history of faking illness (he lied to a previous employer to receive paid time off work claiming he was being treated for cancer when he was not), I do not trust that his intentions here are genuine. I suspect he sees the trust as a way that he can get free money so that he doesn't have to get another job.

Anyhow, my question: since the trust is for the benefit of my daughter and she is obviously a minor, what can I do to ensure it is protected? Should I assume that the trustee has her interests in mind and will not prematurely release money for something like this, or does it sound like there is real danger that he will drain the trust? Is it possible for me to hire a lawyer to argue that the money should be saved for her later in life unless the circumstances are truly dire? I'm not sure if I can actually hire a lawyer and get them involved because I am not the trustee, the company is.

My daughter is dying of complications from cancer. My wife and I don't agree on final interventions. How do we come to an agreement on something as profound as this?,"I apologize if this doesn't come across coherent. Too much ugly crying.

We have been battling cancer for many months now. Her liver has started to fail and despite all efforts we have been told by the doctors that short of a miracle she will likely die within the next 24hours. Eventually we are looking at a few possible situations at the end. Either her brain will stop working and she will die that way. She could also reach a point wher she can't get enough oxygen without intubation. The other option is she goes into cardiac arrest.

If she goes into cardiac arrest they can attempt CPR. We have been told that due to the tumor growing in her spine chest compressions will likely break her back.

If she needs to be intubated it is quite possible that the process would cause so much damage (she has already started bleeding in her lungs slightly last night) that she would essentially drown in her own blood.

Both interventions we have been told have a low chance of surviving. Even if we do she could have brain damage from high ammonia levels. On top of that she is still battling stage 4 cancer of a cry aggressive kind that will still likely kill her.

I don't want either of these interventions as I feel she has gone through enough. My wife wants to do any and all interventions needed. I don't want her to suffer any more.

I don't want my wife to resent me wanting this. We have tried to talk about it a few times but haven't come to an agreement. A part of me feels like a POS for not wanting to try anything but I just don't want her to suffer anymore if we only get a few more weeks/months.

What do I do to find common ground. I tried asking a social worker at the hospital last night but didn't get a great answer on how to find a compromise. Perhaps someone on here has gone through a similar problem and can help with some advice.


edit: thank you for the advice everyone. My wife and I have agreed on a plan. We are looking at the final few hours almost certainly. Please support childhood cancer research. No parent should have to go through this.

2nd edit: I appreciate all the advice and I want to give another update. Firstly, my daughter is only 5. I don't believe she is capable of truely understanding her death. Either way this all happened rather quickly. Last week she was getting a few hours outside of the hospital and enjoying life. She was very alert and still strong enough to walk around with help. Her liver failure is a  due to a rare condition called VOD which came on her very quickly. Within the span of 24 hours she lost her ability to communicate with us due to toxic levels of ammonia in her blood. 

She does still have a chance, albeit small, to come out the other side of this. The medicine to heal her liver just hasn't had enough time. She has already been intubated before a couple months ago and came out fine. 

My wife and I decided to try intubation again but say no to CPR. She was intubated a couple hours ago. So far she has stabilized and at the very least she is much more comfortable now due to the sedation than she was before being intubated. Both my wife and I are ok with the decision and have agreed to no further interventions. 

Thank you everyone for your love,support, good vives and prayers you are sending. We'll take all the positive energy we can get.",relationship_advice

"My sister got kicked out of her gym, they refuse to give her a refund for it after they renewed it themselves","I will be using a throwaway for this due to privacy concerns.

My sister is overweight, weighing in at nearly 400 pounds. It is a very embarrassing thing for her, and it's always been a struggle to help her shed weight. Her endo has diagnosed her with severe thyroid problems along with hormonal imbalances that have been difficult to treat even with various medications. So a part of her current weight loss regiment is to exercise at a gym as recommended by her GP and her endocrinologist. She has enrolled at (x) Gym a few weeks ago.

Right away, she has claimed that she has had run-ins with a group of catty women. My sister has depression and anxiety, formed partly due to intense bullying from classmates and co-workers as well as abuse from our parents. So she tends to get overly nervous and makes mistakes. So my sister began to misuse the equipment accidentally, and the women tear into her in a very mean way. My sister apologizes but these women report her to the gym who reprimand my sister.

So for many days, my sister was being belittled and insulted by this group. They continued to report her and make her feel bad. Still she tried to ignore it because her health depended on this. One day, my sister got filmed struggling with the equipment and she slipped on the mat, falling on her butt. This was posted online and got passed around the gym and outside of it. She found out way later, and this hurt her. When she reported this to the gym, the manager said he would speak to the women. Days later, she asked the manager if he spoke to them, and he asked who my sister was (basically he forgot).

My sister wrote a complaint to the higher ups at the gym. She received a response stating that there was nothing they could do about her being filmed, as it was a public space. Three days after this, she received a notice stating her membership at the gym was cancelled. Despite this, she was charged the renewal fee. I stepped in and called them, demanding a refund on my sister's behalf. The gym told me that it was her responsibility to cancel the membership herself, I told them that *they* were the ones who cancelled on her. Basically the conversation went in circles.

Now what can I do? I have a feeling that there's not much I can do legally but I am hoping something can be done. My sister does not want to go to the media because she feels embarrassed and is afraid of being in front of a camera, also of the video online gaining more visibility. Can I take them to court? If so, for what charges? Can I legally compel them to give my sister the refund?",legaladvice

AITA for inviting my atheist friends only for the wedding party and not the ceremony?,"Edit: didnt expect this to be a reason to be called a ""child molestator cultist"" but I suppose that's reddit for you?

I am getting married in a few months. We have a few atheist friends who have a general dislike for religion so I thought it would be for the best to only invite them to the party. My future wife and both of our families are Roman Catholic. Catholic ceremonies are *long*. I'm talking 1 hour of pure mass and additional half an hour of the actual ""getting married"" part. If you are not a believer, it is boring af. Hell, Im Catholic and I know I'll be bored for 80% of it. I thought I'll spare them the trouble.

Anyway, one of my friends brought it up, saying I forgot to put the time and the church where the ceremony will take place on the invitation. So I said that she doesnt have to come to the religious part and just come for the wild party part. She got confused, I explained and she got annoyed to say the least. Said she isnt heartless and would sit through the 2/3 to see me get married in the 1/3. I tried to explain again & fix things but I felt guilty the whole time. 

Was it an asshole move?


Edit: ah, I suppose I am TA. Just for clarification though: 
- we did explain things and they are coming to church. No hard feelings between us. 

- those who I decided to ""spare"" expressed anti-religious-events stances in the past (not going to Christenings, First Communions & Confirmations) so I thought it translated to wedding ceremonies

- i also thought it would be considerate to not force them to come because of the sense of ""they invited me so i have to"" and ended up going wrong about it :/",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by getting frisky with my girlfriend,"Alt because this embarrassing for her and for me, and she follows my actual reddit account. 

Anyways, my girlfriend and I have been dating for a while now, but we moved to opposite sides of the US to attend college. We would have been together for college too but stanford gave me that fat L. This wasn't too big of a deal freshman year since we still had summer and winter break to see each other, but starting last year things got really busy for us. I went with my parents when they flew back to China for a family emergency, and then over the summer, we both had work to do in completely different places. The only time we got to be with each other was over spring break. 

Fast forward to our current school year and we again missed the opportunity to hang out over winter break, so by the time I fly out to the Bay Area to go visit her over spring break, it had literally been an entire year since I've even held hands with her. Naturally, being stressed college kiddos with pent-up sexual desire, we sought release as soon as possible. So the morning after I arrived, we have sex. She has always been one to like rough sex, and in particular, she loves getting choked. So of course I oblige her and unwittingly, I leave a bunch of very obvious, VERY red and angry looking marks on her neck and on her arms from pinning her down. Well we just casually cleaned up afterwards and went down to the kitchen in her dorm to make breakfast without really thinking about the marks.

I sat down at a table, and she went into the kitchen to grab a bagel or something, when like six of her housemates also came down to get breakfast. I guess I have a kind of angry disposition immediately after I have sex, since one of her friends asks if I'm doing fine, before heading into the kitchen as well. It's at this point that they also see my girlfriend, who is not with an angry-looking me, and who has red hand marks on both her body and her neck. Well they put two and two together and soon, I see them whisk my girlfriend away, while one person comes to angrily ask me about why I was physically assaulting my girlfriend, while threatening to call the police and campus pubsafe. I naturally, have no clue what they're talking about and I can hear my girlfriend being questioned at the same time. The person who was talking to me begins to shout some stuff at me, and it doesn't take long before a few sleepy people start drifting out of their rooms and towards us to investigate. At this point, I'm guessing my girlfriend's friends offered to her to get pubsafe involved as well, because she dashes over to where I was sitting and begins to frantically explain to the small crowd gathered in the kitchen area what exactly had happened. She basically told a good portion of her housemates that she has a thing for rough sex, and that she had merely asked me to choke her while doing to do, much to the embarrassment of everyone listening, and to the two of us. Extolling the details of your sex life to the public generally isn't one's proudest moment. Afterwards, we both got a few very red-faces apologies, and she quietly ate her bagel.

My brother is on the spectrum, and he is someone who basically needs constant and around the clock care. He is in his 20's now, but mentally he is about \~8 years old.

Nearly a year ago my mom suddenly passed away due to a blood clot in the brain, it came out of nowhere and shocked our family and my dad passed a few years back from cancer. 3 years ago our mom had a will drawn up, and my older sister basically agreed in the event of something happening she would be responsible for my brother (there were a ton of reasons for this specifically the fact she lived within my brothers support network, while i am far away). In agreement with this my mom put aside a large amount of money for the purpose of my brothers well being.

My sister and her fiancee took my brother in for about 6 months, but it became very apparent that she misunderstood the amount of work required for his care. She asked if i would be willing to take him for a month or so while she went and took time off. I agreed simply because of the fact i am now a stay at home mom, but told her i couldn't do this for long.

One month turned into two, and then finally 4. She kept making excuse after excuse, but she finally agreed that she would take him when they got back from a vacation in Europe to visit her fiancee's family. When she got back she would let me know. Then basically nothing, absolutely fucking nothing for two months. Never responded to any of my emails, messages or phone calls.

Finally yesterday i received a long facebook message from her telling me:

* She isn't coming back to Canada, as she has decided to get married in Europe and live there with her fiancee.
* She isn't coming back for my brother, and said i needed to take care of him as he is now ""my problem"".
* She said she was sorry but she couldn't deal with him anymore.

She has blocked me on facebook, and her cell phone number no longer seems to work anymore.

I know this sounds cold, but i can't do this. I can't take care of my brother anymore. On top of this all the money that my parents put aside for my brother, aside from a bit she sent me early on i have no idea where that money is or where it went.

I have tried a variety of services, and explained my situation about my brother, but i have discovered there is basically fuck all help for me. I was told it could take several years to find a place for him in a care facility, and it is just wait list after wait list.

So like my question is, can my sister really just abandon him like this? Isn't there some sort of law against basically abandoning someone your responsible for? I know he isn't a child anymore, but mentally he is.

To clarify a few things, i love my brother, but he is far too much for me to handle and my toddler. We have been struggling to make ends meet financially, with the increased upkeep cost. To the point where i worry for our future. I can't leave my brother alone, so i working is out of the question. ",legaladvice

TIFU by being young and dumb I guess,"*I was 16 when this happened. Golden age of fuck ups.* 

I hooked up with one of the girls from my church. We were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. I was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the Big G. However the two of us shared one common goal. We wanted to fuck. Which we did. But afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her ""carnal sins"". She named and shamed both of us. None of this would've been *that* bad if it wasn't for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father.

AITA for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?,"tl;dr at bottom

Okay so I'm almost 19.

When my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. They got married later on, converted to Christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

I know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. He didn't say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. I thought it's weird they never told their daughters, given that they're all such protestors against abortion.

But anyways dad also has a sister, who's daughter I'm really close with. She's Christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last May. Then her boyfriend left her over it. I absolutely adore her baby, and I try to help raise him given that he doesn't have a father.

I'm usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle's daughters, and I was messaging them three way last night. I was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why I would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

I told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. But they overrode me, saying that she's easy and shouldn't have spread her legs blah blah blah. It went on for a few more messages.

I got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

""Yeah I hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. Everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.""

Three hours later and there was still no response; I knew I was in deep shit.

And I was! My parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning I'm using my old old old phone right now. They were very tense with me today. I was very earnest.

So, long story short, 3 days ago I ""broke up"" with her for good.

Now, you guys might not agree with the way I did it, but I did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. Even though I am sad and disappointed, at the same time I understand she wanted to see other options and I respect she didn't outright cheat on me. That being said, I am also not a backup plan and I deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

I didn't see her anymore and I finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""Hey \[name\], first of all, I don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. I took some days to think about it and I realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and I would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. I understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. Sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. I respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. I wanted to thank you for all those years and I wanted to apologize for any wrongs I did to you. I want you to know that I am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. I hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. Goodbye, op""

The message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but I realized I am already getting over it and that I no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. She replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. So, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, I am almost certain that I would accept her back.

Today I came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from,"[The Mystery Fence](https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nQdq)

Delaware, USA. No homeowners association.

We live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. It's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. There was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). I removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

Well I come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. Part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. The leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

I don't know who owns it, so I called the real estate agent. He was just as shocked as I was when I told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. He had no idea. He'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. I asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. She didn't.

A more long-term solution would be to contact housing if it continues to be a problem, as my only two concerns is that my apartment doesn't have a smell when I move out, and my wife's clothes don't smell like weed when she's at work.  
  
Reading through my lease agreement, I actually don't see anywhere that mentions drug use, or even smoking of any kind. Thinking back, the area around the demo room when we were being shown around before we signed a lease reeked of weed as well.  
  
Lastly, I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble. I don't care if anyone else smokes weed. I was born and raised in Austin. I can probably count on one hand how many people I knew that didn't smoke weed in my 30 years living there. I just don't think my apartment needs to smell like that, you know?

Putin is a corrupt dictator, a dick with few if any redeeming characteristics, and he does not give two fucks about any developing country.

That does not change the fact that he is fundamentally right on this.

For most of the developing world,  the cost of entry/adoption of renewable energy is prohibitively expensive.

If you are a developing country like Nigeria, for example, you desperately need to build and run massive water cleaning plants for you capital, Lagos, with a population of 22 million people, most of which lack sewerage and clean water.  You also need to build infrastructure like bridges, a train/subway system, tunnels, roads, airports, etc...All of that takes lots of electricity, concrete, steel, and lots and lots of CO2 emissions. Nigeria is very very rich in Oil by the way, which they can extract quite cheaply.

So it would be a very interesting conversation to watch when some privileged kid from a rich country who always benefited from an amazing infrastructure build on the back of fossil fuels, tells Nigeria that they should not build that inexpensive coal/oil power plant in order to run that water purification plant that they desperately need, because they will be worse off in the end due to global warming. That they should wait many more years and save a lot more money to build a solar power plant instead (never mind the issues of energy storage or running the water plants at night).

Yes, many of their children might die of dysentery in the mean time, but on the long run, it will be better for the planet. It would be a truly fascinating conversation to watch.

It was clear she had a crush on him, but I never thought anything of it. Until she started complaining about things, I'd rather not go in to detail in, that were very familiar to me from when I had been pregnant. 

I didn't jump to the conclusion, but I did ask in to what they do when they hang out. 

They'd been having sex. God knows he knew about that stuff already but it had been going on for some time. I won't go in to details. Because I never wanted to imagine them myself. 

We had the birds and the bees talk, so she knew where babies came from. My boyfriend was fuming after I told him, and went straight to talk to the parents.

They knew as much as we did of the whole thing. They were as shocked as we were. We've already talked together, and they agree we need to terminate the pregnancy, for many reasons.

But she keeps saying she wants a baby. And I just don't fucking know what to do. I tried to explain all the issues you deal with when pregnant,  I was trying to be level headed. But she didn't seem to understand at all. We've scheduled several visits to the clinic already. 

What can I do? Is the boy, or his parents liable? What can a doctor do? Can the pregnancy be ended without her consent, if she wasn't able to consent in the first place?  
I'm at such a fucking loss. My world is crumbling.

TIFU by Reading Contract Law Textbooks to my 2 Year Old,"Obligatory this happened 7 years ago, as my son is now 9, and this decision has now come back to haunt us.

Background filler:


(I graduated law school in December 2007 and passed the bar exam in February 2008.  I kept my BarBri materials as I was going to trade with a friend who took the bar in a state I was debating taking it in, but that never worked out, so they remained in the office.)

The Story:


Our son was born in 2009 and this happened in 2011-12.  He was not any easy child to get to go to bed and we would often read to him for hours.  One night I had enough and decided to find the most boring thing I could, so I pulled out my Barbri Book on Contracts and started reading it.  He was fascinated and demanded I read more and more.  He'd ask questions, like any good Dad I answered.  So I was teaching my 2.5-3 year old contract law, and eventually more advanced contract law.  

Fast forward to Kindergarten.  He got upset with his teacher one day because she entered into a verbal contract to give them an extra recess if they did X and Y.  Well they did, but it rained, so she couldn't give them the time.  This did not sit well, as our son proceeded to lecture her on the elements of a verbal contract and how one was created and she breached it.  She had no answer for him, and we had a talk about it with her.

Unfortunately, this behavior didn't stop.  He would negotiate with adults for things he wanted, and if he felt he performed his side of the contract, he would get angry if they breached.  He will explain to them what the offer was, how he accepted it, and what was the consideration.  And if they were the ones who made the offer, he would point out any ambiguity was in his favor.   When they tried pointing out kids can't enter contracts, he counters with if an adult offers the contract, they must perform their part if the child did their part and they cannot use them being a child to withhold performance.  

This eventually progressed to him negotiating contracts and deals with his classmates in second grade**.  Only now he knew to put things in writing, and would get his friends to sign promissory notes.  He started doing this when they started doing word problems in math. He knew these weren't enforceable, but would point out his friends did not know this.   We eventually got him to stop this by understanding he couldn't be mad because he knows they can't form a contract.  

It culminated in Third Grade when he negotiated with his teacher to have an extra recess.  This time, he remembered to have her agree that she would honor it later if it rained (which it did).  So then she said she wouldn't, and he lost it and had to see the principal.   Who agreed with him and talked to the teacher.

Now that this happened, we had to also see the Principal to discuss this.  She is astounded how good he is at this, but acknowledges we need to put a stop to it*.  So it is now put in his Education plan that adults cannot engage in negotiation with him as he is adept at contract formation and tricking adults into entering verbal contracts.  

TLDR: I taught my 2-3 year old contract law out of desperation to get him to go to bed.  When he got to school he used these skills to play adults. 

Edit: *When I say put a stop to it I mean the outbursts when adults don't meet their obligations in his eyes. The principal encourages him to talk out solutions and to find compromise. 

Edit 2: **Clarified the time line and added context. ",tifu
TIFU by rubbing my ass into a security guard's crotch... out of habit.,"Normally, students can beep into my school with an ID card.

It's RFID, and pretty reliable, so most people don't take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.

I'm a junior, and I've been getting into the building the same way for years. I keep my ID Card in my back pocket, so I just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. That sounds a little weird to write, but I promise it's easy to do in one smooth motion, and I'm definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.

Only issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn't lock. As a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our ID out to show him as we walked in.

Coming in at 8:00AM, after years of habit... I was on autopilot.

I approached the security guard, he said, ""ID?"" and I nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (Obviously I didn't hear the beep, so I guess my brain thought I wasn't close enough to the ""reader""?)

It all took about two seconds, and when I felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, I suddenly realized what I was doing... but before I could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all ""Woah woah woah! Miss! I just the need the ID, please, not a lap dance!"" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn't cause this.

I tried to explain, but he wasn't willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that's that. Couple of other students saw so I'm waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.

TL;DR: Decided I could bribe my way into school without an ID by giving the security guard a lapdance... I was right.",tifu

Bullies who pick on kids to the point of suicide should be shown the body of their victim.,"As long as there's solid evidence that they're guilty of harrassing/bullying/torturing the deceased (there should be a thorough investigation first) I feel like they should suffer like the family of their victims and the victims themselves. If they're that hateful that they drive someone to take thier own life then they should bare witness to the consequences of their actions, I don't feel like it's enough to just tell them, show them. Obviously with the permission of the family. 


I also feel like they should answer to the family of the person they bullied, really get a feel for what they have done. It will probably scar them for life, GOOD, the pain the family will be in for the rest of their lives is incomparable so the guilty party should feel at least a percentage of that. 


It may seem harsh but I just read a story about a young boy who layed in front of a train and killed himself due to being bullied. He was 14. He killed himself in front of 40/50 other students including his friends who will also be scarred for life. All because some vicious little pricks harrassed him until he no longer saw a light at the end of the tunnel. And what will the guilty get? Slap on the wrist? Expulsion? Ridiculous. Teach them a lesson, make them look at what they've done and give them the opportunity to apologise face to face to the families who have been broken by the sadistic actions of these nasty, spiteful kids. I'm talking high school and up because that's generally where it gets bad, although this is starting to creep into primary schools too which is horrifying.


If I thought for one second that any kind of preventative measure would work then I'd suggest that instead. But years of unrelenting abuse and families losing their kids to suicide has lead me to believe that there is no tactic of prevention that would actually work worldwide. That hurts my heart. People are so cruel. I don't want to send my baby to school, I'm terrified. And my heart is broken for that poor boy, his friends and family, and all of the innocent kids who saw such a horrific scene unfold 4 days before their summer holidays began.

[Update] I [31m] found torn-up remnants of a Plan B box in the kitchen garbage. My wife [27f] should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because I had a vasectomy years ago. I talked to her.,"I would like to preface this post with an apology. I know it has been nearly three weeks since I last posted. To be honest, in no world did I ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. I've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. Not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original It, I have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. For that, I am sorry.

For the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. It is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

For the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a Greek tragedy, I apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

Now to start where things left off.

After making my original post, I combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a Plan B box and thrown it into the garbage. A lot of them made sense. My greatest hope was that it might have just been old. Maybe it was before we even met. Clinging to that, I hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. I'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what I would say in response, and what I would do. I memorized them all.

On the evening after I made my original post, I called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. As I had practiced, I asked her the following question:

>Hey, I'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? 

The second the words ""Plan B"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. She was completely lost for words. I already knew at that point. I retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>Why was there a torn up Plan B box in the garbage? You know I had a vasectomy. 

She just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. Then she looked to the floor. Then she started weakly sobbing. 

This was not on the flowchart. I had no idea how to respond. I thought if I let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. Finally I prompted her with another question:

>Are you crying because you did something you regret?

She shook her head violently. I was so concerned because I thought something horrendous might have happened.

She abruptly shrieked ""I'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" I have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

So I prompted her again. 

>Just tell me why it was there. You don't have to hide anything from me.

She yelled at me again. Repeatedly. ""If you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""Fuck you for not trusting me.""

This line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. I refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, I wasn't budging an inch. She then informed me that either I had to leave or she would leave. Since I doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), I agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. I went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

The following night, I texted her asking if she was ready to talk. She was not. Instead, she gave me an ultimatum: I had to [1] apologize, [2] promise to never bring it up again, and [3] learn to trust her completely. Only then would she allow me back home. If I couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

I have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. I am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. I currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. The lawyer will probably tell me I'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

There is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. I am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. None of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. I'm holding off on saying anything until I'm calm and rational and won't do something I'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, I feel awful about it. ",relationship_advice
I'm a pedestrian who waved in an SUV in a narrow gap and he got into an accident and he's threatening to sue me.,"This happened a few days ago. I live in Philly and I was walking along a busy street and I see this SUV at a one-way narrow street waiting to move forward at a green light. There is a small car ahead of him that's turning right. The SUV wasn't moving past the car because he thought he didn't have enough room. I saw that he did and I just gave him a thumbs up that he can go. He ended up hitting the other car (he was trying to avoid the curb I guess and turned at the last second). 

They got into a bit of an argument and shared info and decided to call the police to make a claim I think. I didn't really listen but the other guy (in the small car) asked me to hang back and provide a witness in case he needs it since I saw the whole thing. They both shared each others insurance and ID.

The SUV guy asked me for my ID for witness too for his insurance claim. Soon after he took a picture of my ID on his phone he said I was the reason he moved and that he will have to make a claim against me. He is threatening to sue me and said that he would rather just send me the damage bill of both of the cars. I felt bad because I gave him the thumbs up that there was room but he DID turn at the last second. The other guy was also annoyed that I shouldn't have told him to go. 

He called and left a VM that I need to act soon because if he makes a claim in a court it would lead to a lot of legal fees for both of us or something. He said that if I agree to pay I can just pay half of the damages.

I'm worried that it's going to be a huge amount and I don't want to go to court. If it goes to court will I have my credit ruined? Sorry I don't know too much legal stuff!

Edit: Now he is saying that my future will be screwed and my credit score is going to be messed up and that there is a possibility that I may be criminally convicted?? I am an immigrant here on a visa and I am worried that it's going to affect me!

Edit 2: Hey guys, thank you so much for your support! This has been really helpful. However, I am getting conflicting advice here. Some are saying that the other person (SUV guy) has a case and it seems like there have been cases similar to this. Some are telling me that I am absolutely guilty and should have everything taken from me! Also I am not sure who Ayan Rand (legal author?) is and how this affects me? I spoke with a legal hotline service and they said that they are not sure of the laws but I need to get a notarized letter from the SUV guy saying that i won't be sued if I choose to pay. I am honestly super scared and stressed that my immigration status will be affected (like the guy said). Should I be contacting immigration lawyer too?",legaladvice

AITA for kicking my husband out of the house because he lied to me about money,"My husband hid $1500 (some insurance payout) from me and he played the whole ""I don't have money for gas"" victim part. This money is not part of our savings or anything. Anyway, he had been hiding the money for 2 weeks. During those two weeks I bought groceries for us, I paid for our take out food, I offered to pay for his broken windshield, and overall I was concerned about whether or not he had enough money for himself. He saw me struggle putting to put gas in my truck. He let me pay for his car insurance. He heard my concerns and my offers to help him and he did not once tell me not to worry.

Yesterday I asked him to lend me $20 because a friend invited me somewhere last minute and I didn't have cash. He got really nervous when I asked him if I could borrow his debit card. He started to act strange. I asked him if he was hiding something from me and he called me crazy and accused me of not believing him. I asked him if he was hiding money from me? And he denied it and said I was paranoid and crazy.

He checked his bank account in front of me and acted surprised. He literally shouted, ""wow wow wow I have extra money!!!! Oh my god this is so awesome!!"" And he played the whole I didn't know part.

He continued to argue and I told him that I don't care about the money I care about honesty. Why did he lie? and if he can lie so blatantly about this then he can lie (or has lied) about many things.

It took a whole day for him to finally confess that he was hiding the money from me because supposedly I was going to ask for some money if I knew. He said he felt guilty for not telling about it when he saw me struggle with money.

Today I asked him to leave the house. I called him cruel and deceitful. I told him that I don't want to be with someone that can lie so blatantly.

By the way I'm 6 months pregnant with a very wanted and planned baby. We've know each other for 3 years.

Am I the as*hole for leaving him over this? 
I'm just so hurt by how easily he lied and called me crazy and paranoid. And now I'm questioning everything in our relationship. Maybe his gym sessions are time that he spends with women. I don't know anything anymore.

AITA thinking of leaving marriage because step-daughter got herself knocked up...,"Yeah, I know this sounds awful.

My (32M) wife's (35F) daughter (16F) recently announced she is pregnant. 

She claims she doesn't know who the father is. I suspect she actually does and doesn't want to say, for whatever reason. I mean how much unprotected sex is a 16 year old really having? It can't be that hard to narrow it down for goodness sake.

Anyway, moving on. She is adamant on keeping the baby. Abortion is out of the question apparently. Wife completely supports her decision and is excited about having her first grand kid. They're both ecstatic.

The problem I have with this is:

1. My wife's daughter is not going to be the one to look after this kid. She's still in school and fully intends to go to college. My wife and I will 100% end up looking after it.

2. I am going to be the one paying tens of thousands of dollars to raise this kid. My wife works part time and makes very little money. I don't have a problem with this as it lets her do volunteer work that she enjoys, but it means the financial burden of this kid will be 100% on me.

3. I wanted to have at least one kid with my wife. She's entering her late 30s so it's now or never. I feel like this kid will mean the two of us will never have our own because of both the emotional and financial burden raising it will put on us.

I raised my concerns with my wife and her response was expected but disappointing. ""This isn't up to you. This is her decision to make. We will support her.""

I agree it's her decision, but why do I have to support her?

As it stands now, I'm thinking of cutting my losses and leaving the marriage if her daughter has this child. I'm not prepared to put off starting my own family for the sake of her daughter, nor am I prepared to pay to raise it.

I fully intend to let them know this before the baby is born so they can make an informed decision on whether they can support it.

TIFU by asking about my parenta divorce and found out I contributed to the divorce.,"Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/co5hbl/tifu_update_asking_about_my_parents_divorce_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Okay, first off, my parents have been divorced for 12+ years. I am 21 now and was 7 or 8 when they split. I found out a few years ago it was because my mom was cheating on my Dad with my nurse from the NICU from 1997 (oof).

Casually talking to my mom (who has since remarried for the THIRD time) I asked about their divorce out of curiosity. She went into a few details and brought up a car ride with my Dad. She wouldnt elaborate so I called my Dad (BIG MISTAKE)

Mind you, Dad took me and my sister in when my mom left and raised us. It kind of went like this:

Me: ""So I was talking to mom about your divorce and she brought up a ride in the car with you that initiated the divorce""

Dad: *hesitantly* "" Yeah, you, me and your sister were in the car when I came back from overseas and we were talking about what you guys wanted to be when you grew up. Your sister said something and you said ""I want to be a nurse like, [insert his name here]"". I pulled over to the side of the road and you spilled the beans""

Apparently, at 7 or 8, I informed my dad about a guy staying in OUR house in HIS room sleeping in THEIR bed while he was gone for months for military stuff. I told him EVERYTHING. How mom told us he was an ""old friend"" who needed ""help"" and who would be staying with us ""to protect us while Daddy is gone"". How he watched us for a week while mom disappeared, took us to movies, dinner, etc. There was a point of him asking if I would move to California with him and my mom (they got married 2 weeks after my parents divorce was finalized and moved to California)

I never remembered this occurence. He said he went home, pulled phone records, emails and even the chat messenger history (this is like 2004 or 2005 idk).

I'm not blaming myself, but, damn. Little me saved my Dad's ass from being used any longer by her.

Note to self: dont ask too many questions.
Insert big ""WHAT THE FUCK"" here

TL;DR. TIFU by asking too many questions about my parents divorce and found out I'm the one who dimed my mom out for infidelity.

Edit: This is a fuck up because I was apparently never supposed to know - hence my mom not wanting to talk about it and my dad being hesitant on telling me.

Edit 2: Super fuck up. I'm learning more and more about their marriage I never needed to know from other family. I was the ""save the marriage"" baby

Edit 3: Wow. I didnt realise how many other people have gone through finding out this kind of stuff later in life. Kudos to all of you for learning from the example!

Edit 4: Holy shit! I've learned a lot from all of you! This blew up and I've made a few decisions:
-I am never getting married
-I think it's time to cut off my mom
-Dont ask questions about your parents failed marriage - 

Edit 5: Apparently, after the divorce, she wrote my grandmother a letter stating she didnt want to take care of children and wanted to ""live her life""

Also, I didnt remember this occurence because I guess it didnt really stick out to me. My dad said he acted calm and acknowledged everything, like a normal convo. The events after I remember oh so vividly.

Moral of this story: Dont think your kids wont talk if you're cheating and do not BRING them around your kids. Actually, just dont cheat ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è easier said than done but damn!

Also, please note, I didnt have to throw any paper for my mom to be a ho!

Final Edit: Thanks to everyone for sharing their stories similar to mine and acknowledging that, for the children, the divorce was never their fault! These conversations have really got me thinking about how toxic for me it is to talk to my mom. I'll update in a bit. Thanks guys and keep your head up if you fuck up!",tifu
TIFU by getting Hulk Hogan stuck to my foreskin,"Even though this happened over a decade ago, my family still occasionally roasts me for it.

Back when I was around 9 or 10 my family bought me [these toys for Christmas](https://m.imgur.com/a/AD358JS). As the pictures suggests, you could ""connect"" a figure's fists to anothers via the magnets on the fists themselves - which happened to be **really** strong.

You can probably see where this is going already... In my not-so-clever mind I wanted to see if I could connect the wrestlers to my foreskin. I remember stretching my foreskin with one hand whilst also holding one of the wrestlers fists against the stretched skin. Then with my other hand I grabbed the other wrestler and slowly brought its fist closer to the foreskin where the other fist was sitting on the other side. **SNAP** I fell over and screamed in agonising pain, as not only were Hulk Hogan and Goldberg stuck to my foreskin - they were pinching the end like a snapping turtle. 

Hulk and Goldberg held their grip while I screamed in pain. I tried pulling them apart but due to the pain or panick I just couldn't.

To my absolute embarrassment, my Mum and Dad rushed into the room and had to pull Hulk and Goldberg from my dick.

This story is still brought up at Christmas dinners to this day.

Insecure GF Caught Flirting,"Throwaway for obviousness. This is gonna be a long one. 

Where to begin? Girlfriend has previously accused me of not seeing obvious red flags with other women. Friends, coworkers, acquaintances. Even being in the same room as one of these people is a problem for her which has resulted in my not going out to company functions and cutting off entire circles of friends where the person is a part of.

Fine. I love her. I understand that these people are chapters in my life that may not be around later so it's not that big of a deal even though I've lost sleep over it. 

Girlfriends friend introduces her to some new people. One of these she immediately clicks with and ends up on the phone until 6am. While I can only hear one side of the conversation, this guy has asked her numerous questions about her relationship and sexual history which she obliged and answers. Some of these stories I've never heard before. Call it insecurity but I've never asked a woman if she's had a one night stand or what her sexual kinks were. I asked her about it afterwards making reference to the situations she's put me in in the past and her immediate response was to accuse me of being controlling and scaring her. What?

A few days roll by and she's continued these talks with this person. We've had our arguments and came to an understanding of 'if he does or says anything that crosses a line' she will end the friendship. 

But where is the line? He's already had her describe herself. Explain past relationships. Sex talk and favorite kinks. Taking until hours in the morning. Where is the fucking line?

I told her that her friendship with this person is literally destroying me and she assures me I have nothing to worry about. 

Well. 

I just looked at her phone.

And while I wish I didn't. I'm glad I can see with my own eyes that she lied to my fucking face. They've been flirting. The questions via text were 10x worse. And her friend that introduced them encourages this, telling her how she keeps her relationship from her S/O. 

But what's worse for me is that she had the fucking nerve to tell this guy that I'm being insecure and allow him to chime in that I'm creating disorder. Then shortly asking her if she would date him if possible. And her saying yes. 

Not even 2 full days into 2019 and I'm about to break up with my girlfriend over a dude she met online not even 3 days ago. 

Username checks out. 

Do I ask for advice now or am I on the right track. I need clarity...

Thank you for making it this far.

TIFU by not locking my dogs out of the room during sex,"So this just happened last night. I should start by saying I have two wonderful, loving big dogs, a GSD and a lab mix. Usually when my fianc√© and I start getting ready to rock and roll we lock them out of the bedroom to avoid any distractions. 

Last night however he woke me up around 1am to have a little midnight fun (he must've been having a good dream). I was about it, we started in, and let the good times roll. It was all going per usual, he was done, I was making my steady climb up the hill to heaven. My eyes were closed and I was not being very quiet. Right as I was about to start my journey back down to earth I feel a long wet tongue on my face. Open my eyes, my GSD is standing in my face looking worried and trying to kiss me. 

Let me tell you, there is no quicker turn off and end to a climax then getting kissed in the mouth by your slobbery dog. I pushed my dog away and my fianc√© just burst into tears from laughing so hard. 

TL;DR we started having sex in the middle of the night, forgot about the dogs. My GSD snuck up and mouth kissed me at my climax and ruined my night. 

Edit: I can't believe the most popular Reddit post I will ever have is about this... thank you strangers for silver and platinum! Also thank you to everyone who shares these experiences and so sorry to those who have gotten tongues to the butt... you win? 

Edit 2: GSD (German Shepard dog) for those of you angry about this, thank you for commenting and bringing my karma up even higher. Also for those of you confused about the whole process, just because my fianc√© was finished doesn't mean he didn't help a girl out. ",tifu
TIFU by telling my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me,"This happened approximately six years ago, I was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that I post it here. 

&#x200B;

So, flashback to undergrad, things are good and I just started dating this beautiful girl that I had met in class. I was enamored with her, shocked that I loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. The first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&#x200B;

After a few months into our relationship, I started to notice some concerning symptoms. As you can probably hypothesize, when I pee'd, it burned. At first, I just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, I decided to stop taking creatine just in case. But, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. I would literally be struggling to stand while I pee'd because the pain was so intense. After, I would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. It was bad. 

&#x200B;

Well, at this point, I was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. No, it had to be what I thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. I hadn't been with anyone else. I hadn't been with anyone else since I began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. I was shocked. Things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had I gone wrong? The thought made my blood boil, until I outright confronted her. I told her I knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. She told me no. I demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. She said sure. (looking back at this I feel like a complete dick). We agreed that we would go the next day.

&#x200B;

The same night I confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. She was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. Around this time my roommates and I had just moved into a new house. In the process all our belongings got shuffled around. As she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" I heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, I've been pissing out bleach?!?! I instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. She took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. Sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when I pee'd. I told my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an STD test. The night before we went, I inadvertently discovered that I had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap. ",tifu

TIFU by misunderstanding my grandpa for my entire life,"This fuck up has been going on my entire life but it just hit me last week so here it goes.

My grandpa is from the south, so he has a bit of an accent and on top of that he's soft-spoken. This paired with my terrible hearing is a diabolical combination. Since I can remember, whenever he sees me he always has said ""Hey! Wanna color?"" in a really fast manner. Which young me always politely declined. Throughout the years this has continued. I always said no thank you because I have shaky hands and my coloring skills are subpar. Plus, maybe he loves coloring I mean hey, if that's his thing then so be it even though I've never once seen him color.

Then last week it dawned on me. He approached me and said  **""Hey! Wanna color?""**  At least that's what I registered at first but then I deciphered it correctly. He was actually saying  **""Hey There Young feller""**  .. I  Instantly became red in the face in embarrassment. For my entire life I have been responding to my grandpas greeting with No Thank you.. I explained the fuck up to him and we both had a good laugh but man I'm never going to live this down.

EDIT: To clear things up people keep asking how would I confuse the two phrases? He talks very quickly, quietly, and has a unique accent. So the two together sound somewhat similar. For those saying this is made up I guess believe what you want? I'm not sure why I'd make up such a strange story.

Thanks for the Silver!!

TIFU by wearing a Halloween costume to school,"this is a case of me being a chronic dumbass.

I thought that because it was Halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but NOPE!

NOT A SOUL.

Nobody wore or did ANYTHING to celebrate. I know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion I spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. I'm not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state I'm only at school like 50% of the time, and I thought ""maybe this time I can have a bit of fun just this once"" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy Halloween.

its safe to say I was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.

if I see someone else with a costume on I might feel better but this was overkill, I'm in 11th grade and thankfully because of that I likely wont be made fun of but costuming will ALWAYS be my passion and someday I will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.

Mechanic said it would take 2 weeks to fix my car. It's been 3 months and now he says he wants more than what we agreed on or he'll transfer the title over to him.,"I live in Washington State.

My car broke down in April and I couldn't afford to take it to a shop. Luckily the AAA tow truck driver said he had experience rebuilding my specific car and could do it for way cheaper $400. I paid him $100 at the start then another $100 after 3 weeks. Every time I asked how close it was he would never tell me a definite answer. Something always came up. Just last night he said he finally got it done. But now he wants $300 instead of the $200 and he said he will transfer the title over to him if I don't pay that amount. 

Is he even able to do that? I feel like I shouldn't have to pay more seeing that he had my car for so long.

Thanks!

Update: Went to go check out the car. Waited 30 min for him to put the intake and oil in which he said he had already did the night before. He started the car and it just blew a ton of burning oil smoke and made an even worse clicking noise than it did before I even brought it to him. 

His excuse was that he ""didn't hear that before"" so he didn't know it was a problem. He then said that he would replace the engine for free as long as I gave him the $300 and brought him a new engine.

I talked with a cop as well and he said there wasn't much I could do since he hasn't actually stolen it yet.

Update 2: Ended up paying him $160 and towed the car out. Also called AAA and reported it with them. Thanks everyone for all the advice!",legaladvice
Can my parents force a pregnancy test?,"My wife was sexually assaulted. She got pregnant, and the baby could be mine or the rapist's. We decided to keep the baby and raise it as mine. We never want to have a paternity test done on the baby because this could be devastating to her relationship with my wife.

I'm a massive moron, and after my daughter was born, I let slip to my parents that she might not be mine biologically. I tried to backtrack, but my parents kept pushing and pushing until my wife sat them down and explained the situation. They do not believe her. They think she cheated and that she is using me.

Now my parents have approached me about taking a paternity test. They want me to contest paternity and leave my wife. I do not want to. I made a commitment to my wife and daughter and I stand by it. I trust my wife, but my parents don't. They told me that if I refuse, they will go to court and compel me to do a paternity test to absolve me of responsibility for the baby. They want me to leave my wife regardless.

I am planning to cut contact with my parents over this, but is there any way that they can legitimately force me to do a paternity test? Is there something I can do to prevent this or fight them?

[update] My wife tried to hide my daughter from me. Am I wrong to feel this angry?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bty3oi/my_wife_tried_to_hide_my_daughter_from_me_am_i/)

Hesitant to post an update after how infuriating some of the replies in the previous thread were, but figure I owe it to those of you that offered genuine well meaning advice. Plus I've had some time to calm down. I probably wont reply to comments because otherwise I'm just going to get worked up again by people saying my wife didn't betray my trust etc. 

If you're a woman and are going to say it's ""understandable"" what my wife did, then consider how you'd feel if you put a kid up for adoption when you were young, that kid tried to reach out when they turned  18... And your husband told them you wanted nothing to with them without ever telling you they tried to reach out. It's not ""understandable"".

--------------------

Wife texted me yesterday and said we ""needed to talk"" while I was at work. This was the first time either of us had spoken or messaged each other since the fight. I dropped our kids off at my parents' house so we could be alone and went straight home. I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting her to say, but I genuinely hoped she would at least apologise first and foremost. Because in my opinion she severely betrayed my trust by not only denying my agency, but also lying to me about it, and then downplaying the entire ordeal.

When I get home and we sit down to talk the first thing she says is that she ""forbids"" me from seeing this young woman. Not an apology. An ultimatum that if I went and saw her, she would kick me out of the house (which is laughable considering I owned the house before marrying her...)

I asked her if she was serious. If she isn't even going to apologise etc, and she reaffirmed she has nothing to apologise for. Yeah, okay. At this point I remembered someone's comment in that post about how she might have done this before. I asked her if she has ever done anything like this previously and she said no. I kept pushing her and she kept saying no. Finally I told her that I had already called the fertility clinic to reach out to any parents and explain what my wife had done in case they had tried to contact me previously (not sure what has come of that yet).  I explain that if I find out she has and she doesn't come clean now, I'm divorcing her immediately. She immediately changes tune and says she has ""only"" done it one other time.  ""Only"". Fuck, that ""only"" infuriated me even though it's just a god damn word.

Anyway turns out another girl called a couple years back after she turned 18 too. Her parents are lesbians and so she just wanted to meet her biological father since she doesn't have a father of her own (according to my wife, so take it with a grain of salt at this point). I tend to believe what she's saying, as the original girl also has lesbian parents and wanted to meet me for the same reason. She wouldn't say **exactly** what she said to this young women, but she did say she made sure she'd stay away from our family. I mean, at least my wife was finally honest with me, but Jesus Christ what a fucking heartless thing to do.

I feel like I don't even know my wife. The woman I thought I married had some fucking empathy.

She still hasn't apologised and goes back to ""forbidding"" me from seeing this young woman. I explained she no longer has a say in the matter. Had she explained her concerns to me like an adult, I would have listened to them and taken them seriously. But by trying to deny me having any choice in the matter, and for being needlessly cruel to these girls, she doesn't get a say in this anymore.

I told her she has 7 days to give me a genuine apology and agree to marriage counselling, or I would call a divorce lawyer. I also reaffirmed she doesn't get a say in whether I meet with this girl, but I would consider her feelings if any future kids reach out (and she doesn't fucking lie about it).

A few hours later she ""apologised"". I say ""apologised"" in quotes because it was clearly not genuine. But whatever, it's at least an admission of guilt. So we're going to to marriage counselling and try to work through this.

Tbh though, I don't think I'll ever see her the same way again. So I have doubts our marriage will last.",relationship_advice
Ketchup is fucking disgusting,"A proper hamburger or cheeseburger should never have ketchup. It dominates the flavor and all you taste is shit. If I want to get the tomato profile, I will put a fucking tomato on my burger and not some pasty, corn syrup, sugary sissy bullshit. Every burger place puts ketchup on the burger by default, so I have to always ask for no ketchup and have the chance of them fucking it up. You ketchup fuckers should have to ask for ketchup, not me.

Putting ketchup on steak should be a capital offense and you should be sent to a reeducation camp. 

It's fat dumb people sauce. Its the keystone or natty light of sauce. Its putrid odor is reminiscent of filthy hooker perspiration. You can literally judge a person by how much ketchup they consume.

"My [20f] boyfriend [27m] did something concerning during sex and I'm not sure if he just ""didn't know"", or if it was intentional...","Together for one year and we live together. Otherwise happy and loving/respectful relationship. This post might be TMI but I don't feel comfortable seeking advice about this irl so I'm asking here how other people would feel about it.

So, we have a good sex life and I have felt happy and satisfied with it. I think he's generous in bed and cares about my own pleasure, I would NOT describe him as selfish and only caring about himself...until THIS incident. However, he's been asking me to try anal for a long time. I kept saying no and explaining my reasoning for it, which was that I was scared it would hurt and because it takes way more prep/care than PIV sex. 

[**here's the TMI part, I apologize**]He had never tried it before. He's been fingering me back there during sex and I was okay with that, but a few days ago I was laying on my stomach during sex and he stuck it in my ass without warning or asking. I was a little drunk but knew it felt off and then it just really hurt. I told him it hurt and he said to try and relax. 

I DID try to relax but it hurt really bad and I asked him like 3x to pull out before he finally did. At which point he apologized. But afterwards he did it again, and I asked him to stop again and he said to ""wait because he was about to finish"" so I allowed it to happen. I just waited til he came while in some pain and it honestly sucked.

 I'm not gonna say I was raped because I blame myself for the whole thing, but it was painful, not enjoyable, and he thinks it was great. There was no lube or anything so obviously it did not feel good for me. He wasn't rough about it but still wtf? How can you not understand that you can't just stick your dick raw into somebody's ass? It's not like a vagina which gets wet on it's own.**It makes me feel like he knew but didnt care.**

I just feel uncomfortable with the whole situation and I am not sure what to do about it. How should I have this conversation with him? What should I do about it? How would you react?",relationship_advice

Also, I know rule 5 says no medical advice, but this seems less than ""How do I treat \_\_\_\_ disease"" and more of ""Everyone does this and I don't what should I do?"" I'm going to get vaccinated but it's more of a matter of where do I go to get vaccines.

I think my (22F) boyfriend (25m) mostly likes me because of my race.,"I've been seeing this guy for about 5 months. Everything has been going really well so far.

I'm half Japanese/Korean and half white. For reference, I've been told by multiple people, including him, that I look like kiko mizuhara. (although I don't agree, I love the compliment btw)

So I've known since the beginning that he loves Japanese culture. No biggie, whatever. I've dated weeaboos before, and it never turned into a problem. 
Somehow my mom got brought up and how I'm more Japanese than Korean. He got weirdly excited. It kind of weirded me out, but I let it go.

Then he said that I ""shouldn't call myself white"" because I'm hapa. That pissed me off, but I didn't make a big deal out of it. Then he said something along the lines of ""you're so lucky you got the best features from both races"" and I was so grossed out.
It escalated, and it basically ended with me saying that I felt fetishized and then he sounded like he was into eugenics. He got angry because he said I called him a nazi. (I did not. I said what he said sounded like eugenics) he then proceeded to cry and say ""it's not my fault I have yellow fever"" and ""Japanese girls are tighter and are more submissive""

I'm honestly afraid to tell our friends about it, but I'm pretty sure I'm done with him. I've had white guys do kinda racist stuff before, but never to this extent. All of our friends are white, and I'm afraid they'll think I'm overreacting or something. Idk. I guess I'm just looking for some type of reassurance that what he said isn't okay. 
Thanks

Edit:
Thank you everyone who responded. It really means a lot to me. To clarify, we had been drinking a little bit, but not that much at all. I have decided to completely end things. I'll never be able to think of him the same way, and it would always be in the back of my head. The friends I have spoken to totally agree with me. I feel so respected by them, and it means the world to me. So yeah, thank you all again. You all made this so much easier for me. I'm just so, so thankful to have all of these kind strangers support my decision!

Edit 2: again, I just want to thank you all! I've blocked him number because he wouldn't stop calling me. My friends are being so supportive- just like you guys. Honestly, I'm not super sad about it anymore. I feel like a dodged a huuuuuge bullet. And to those of you saying you hope this is fake.. I really wish it were too.

Edit 3: wow! I really didn't expect this to get as much attention as it did. Again, thank you all. I'm trying to read all the responses because they all mean a lot to me. I just had a night out with a friend, and life feels good. Thank you, strangers from the internet. <3

Edit 4: I just realized someone gave me gold n silver! Tbh, I don't really know what those mean, but thank you!!!! I'm in awe of how kind you all are, and you have seriously made this situation so much more manageable. I can't thank you all enough. I wish I could hug each and every one of you who gave me kind words and/or validation.

Edit 5: Hey you guys. Just wanna give out another thank you. I wish I could read through everything, but I don't think I'll be able to! Just wanted to clear some things up:

- to the people who are saying it's my fault for dating a white guy, that's bullshit. Not all white people are inherently like this. 

- when I said weeaboo, I mostly meant people who like to watch anime and stuff like that

- I've had a few people message and say stuff like ""there's no way you look exactly like Kiko..."" I didn't say I did. I said some people have told me that which is a huge compliment to me. I don't necessary think I look like her, but I do get where those people are coming from. 

- some people have asked to see a photo of me. venmo me and maybe I will lol

- to the people who are still insisting that this is fake, it's really not. Reading through all of these comments, I'm pretty disgusted by how prevalent this issue really is

- I'm talking about our mutual friends. I met a couple of them through him. Not all of my friends are white, and I knew that none of my personal friends would judge me

- and to the people who said he did nothing wrong, i disagree. I didn't take very much time to make my decision to end things, but I would never be able to see him the same way. The damage was done.

Thank you all again.

Edit 6:
Okay, one more thing. I don't only date white dudes. Race has nothing to do with who I'm attracted to.. seriously. I never said I only date white guys. He just happens to be white and our mutual friends are all white. The area that I currently live in is overwhelmingly predominantly white. I do not have ""white fever"", and I should not have expected this.

But then told her I would support her decision and would love her even if she had them, and would stand by her. We did some research. She then came back to me an hour later and told me she did not want to get them. She then hugged me and started crying. She told me her friend kept making fun of her for it. She said that she had been bullied about it since she was 16. She then told me she though I was lying about me saying I thought her smaller boobs were hot. She kinda just stood and cried for like 10 minutes. So I guess that ended okay with her letting it out...

AITA for spending my Sons lottery winnings money?,"I have a wife (Wilhelma, 40) and two sons (Sam, 17, and Scott, 16).  6 years ago, I ran to the gas station to buy some cigarettes.  Instead of abandoning my family (just a joke) I decided to also buy a lottery ticket for everyone, just for fun.  It was a blast.  We all talked all night about what we would do with our winnings, where we would go, etc.  I mean, this was all fantasy anyway, right?  But I specifically told my kids that they would have to share their winnings, and they would have to put it away for college first and foremost.  Well wouldn't you know it, Sams ticket won.  Of course its actually MY ticket, and I had to claim it.  It didn't win the jackpot, but after taxes we walked away with $60k.  I sat them both down and explained that I was going to save it all for college, but we could celebrate/splurge a little.  They absolutely wanted a gaming system, and Wilhelma insisted on a family vacation that was much needed.  We all agreed on this, and saving the rest.

&#x200B;

I bought the gaming system and a bunch of games for about $1k.  Wilhelma took over the vacation and insisted on a Disney World trip.  The boys don't even like Disney, but it was always Wilhelma's dream to go so we went.  Another $5k.  Last year, Sam wanted a car.  Wilhelma was pretty tired of chauffeuring them around anyway, so I agreed and spent ""his"" $4k on a car.  I pay the insurance, registration, and maintenance under the agreement that he takes over driving Scott to his stuff as well.  Wilhelma had no complaints about any of these purchases.  

&#x200B;

Since day 1, I've actually invested the entire winnings and never dipped into it.  I've always spent my OWN money on all this stuff.  I have invested better than average, and that $60k is now $100k.  Wilhelma knows I have always invested our money, but it was always small amounts since we're poor.  She knows I was investing the lottery winnings as well.  I've always told her about the money doing well, but I guess I never explicitly said how well.  She also has never asked, as she has left our finances completely up to me.  

&#x200B;

Sam is starting college in a few weeks, and we figured out a plan to stretch his $30k over the 4 years.  While looking at the portfolio, Wilhelma noticed it was at $100k and asked how.  I told her I invested the $60k and grew it to $100k.  She then asked why we're only giving Sam $30K when it should be $50k.  I said no, the other $40k is mine.  I managed this account, I made the investments, I did all of the work.  Plus I paid for all that other stuff through our other savings. The $40k stays and I'll keep investing it.  If the boys NEED the money, its there, but if not I'm gonna eventually retire a little early with it.  She thinks I'm stealing ""his"" money since I wouldn't have been able to invest with it if I didn't have it to begin with.  I say its always kinda been my money, and I'm still giving him the $30k I promised him since the beginning.",AmItheAsshole

I (28M) with fiance (27F) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous Ex was the best lover she ever had,"It was quite by accident that I heard this.  We had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  Some of us were in one room playing Texas Holdem and a couple of others were watching a Lord of the Ring marathon.  I thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  Our group had run out of soda so I got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  As I'm rounding the corner I hear my fiance talking and before I completely come in the room I hear her clearly say ""Jason is great but he will never be the lover that Bill was"" she then followed it up with ""Its not really fair to Jason though, Bill was just really gifted down there"".

At first I thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but I decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  Her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and I could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know I was there.  Of course she has no idea I heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how I'm doing and if I'm having fun.  I was tempted to say something like ""I'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but I didn't.  I just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  I just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

Needless to say it fucked me up.  I mean fucked me up bad.  I've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  I couldn't sleep that night and I went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  At first I was angry.  Then I was humiliated.  Then I was depressed.  Then I was angry again.

Look I realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  I would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

I tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on I just kept getting worse and worse.  I was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  That is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and I flat out rejected her.  It wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  I had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  But in the moment instead of being sexually aroused I felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  Nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

She asked me what was wrong and I just told her I must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

So much to my humiliation there I laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  I came clean and told her what I heard.

Well this did not go over well at all.  At first she tried to tell me I did not hear her correctly.  But I just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  Well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  Which once again I am sure was more of a big turn off for her because I was a wreck emotionally.

She tried to tell me how much of a better person I was and how I satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  But all I could hear was Charlie Browns teacher noise.

It's been almost a month and I have zero desire to be with her sexually.  None.  She is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what I have tried I just can not get past this.  It's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  She clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  Well I know I can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  But no matter what I do I can't grow in size.  Obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me I won't believe her.  She's most likely right.

Some back story here.  He dumped her.  It was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  I know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  She said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  So this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  If he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  Now I have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but I don't think she would.

I just don't know what to do here.  I can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  I know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  Her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that I think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told I am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  Like what would happen if I lost my good paying job or better yet what if I were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  Basically what I feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  I know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what I feel.

I'm sorry for the length here and I don't even know what I am asking here.  I am totally lost and if this continues I just think I am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and I need advice.

EDIT:  Holy God.  I made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went Christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  I have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  I don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  I am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  Also thank you for the Gold and Silver kind internet strangers.

EDIT 2:  Dear God.  I read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking I had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5K more posts.  I'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   I was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  I haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have I opened any of the 20 chat screens.  There are issues I want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  She was to use the Barney Gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  In other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  Nope, neither of us drink.  We don't even have it in the house.
2. That I am upset she told her friend.  Well this is an odd thing, before I posted this honestly I wasn't that upset about this part.  I was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  However now reading a lot of the post I have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  I would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. That I am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  Well I'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  But the last part is just out of my control.  No matter what I do I will only ever be 7"" long.  We have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  She said that I was already great with everything but the one thing I can't control. (Okay, so I gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. No I'm not going to do anything rash.  It's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  But yes I have to decide what I am going to do here before long.  It's not fair to either of us is I am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. She is sorry that I heard it.  She said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if I didn't catch her saying it.  It is what it is.  But yes I do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since I first told her.  Me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  I don't know how much of that I believe but right now I guess I don't know why she would lie.  It really has wrecked hell on our Christmas spirit this year I know that. 

EDIT 3:  Engineer for those who keep asking what I do for a living.  She is a paralegal.  
EDIT 4:  People have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how I know she was heartbroken.  We met about 9 months after they separated.  I know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  He just ended things so he could be with another woman.  She approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  On our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  It was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but I did it.  We sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time I never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates I tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because I didn't want to commit either.  After close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  Obviously that was our first night together.  Within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  So yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  I had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

EDIT 5:  Okay I posted it below in the mass of other posts but I have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

AITA for embarrassing a friend on his date because he didn't pay back the money he owed me?,"So I lent a friend of mine ¬£500. He needed it to see him through til the end of the month and promised to repay me on payday. 
Not a problem, I trusted the guy and knew he was good for it. 

Payday comes and goes, no sign of the money. I sent him a message about it. He said ""oh yeah, sorry I forgot, I'll do that now"" 

Two weeks pass and still nothing. I message him again. He said he'd send me the money. Still nothing. He was then avoiding me so I wasn't able to see him face to face. 

I messaged him again and he didn't reply.

7 months have passed since the day he promised to have the money back to me by. I've not been able to get hold of him, nor have I seen him. 

This weekend just gone, I was out at a restaurant and I happened to see him as I was being seated at my table. He was on what looked like a date. 

Now at this point I could see he was acting kinda boasy because he had ordered about 5 starters. It's worth noting that this is a pretty pricey restaurant. So I decided I'd go and say hello. 

I pulled up a chair at his table and started chatting to him about how he is and how I am etc. 

I then proceeded to pick up a fork and try a bit of the food. He looked a bit shocked, but it was good food so I tried something from one of the other plates. At this point his date (I'd learnt that this was their second date) said to me, ""excuse me, but this is our food. What do you think you're doing?"" 

I looked at her and said ""Well since I'm pretty much funding this meal, I figured I may as well sample what my money is getting."" 

I then said to my friend, ""it was nice to see you, I'll leave you to it. We can catch up another day.""

I then left to go back to my table. The people I were with, a party of 10, had very mixed reactions to my behaviour. Some were in favour of what I'd done, others not so much. 

So I'm asking you lot, AITA?

TIFU by losing my right testicle in a ball slapping contest,"Obligatory ""didn't happen today"" but four years ago when I was 17.

Also no need for a throwaway account since pretty much everyone I know have heard the story.

&#x200B;

My friend and I were in the sauna and he gets an idea that we should see which one of us could make our balls clap louder by hip thrusting back and forth and I was like ""yeah haha let's do that!"" So there we were, two straight dudes standing in the sauna hip thrusting away and laughing at the sound our sacks made. My friend won the contest and we sat down. I started to feel a little uncomfortable. Like someone was squeezing my right nut. It didn't hurt that much when I was sitting down but once I got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. My vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ¬∞ C sauna). I dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. My friend brought me a glass of water and I chugged it down in one go. I told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. He asked me if I preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, I said I'll have both. I chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually I require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. I laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level I told him that I'm going to head home. I had ridden my moped there so I had to ride it home as well. It was winter and the roads were bumpy. Each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but I managed to get home. Once I got home I walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. Usually I stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why I went to sleep so early. She was worried that I had been drinking or taken drugs so I just told her that I almost fainted and want to sleep now. In the morning when I woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so I rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. She examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. When I got home from school I showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. There they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. We waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that I had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. A nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. I changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. I was put to sleep and when I woke up in the recovery ward I immediately sat up. A nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. They tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. I started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). The nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. They were shocked about my condition and asked me how I was feeling ""as a man"" but I told them that I just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest.

Man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.,"He wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. Some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

""You're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""But you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

All of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. The man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. When the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. Each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. Only then does the man realize how hungry he is. A guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

The beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""That one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. All the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. I've heard the food is better there.""

So the man gets his food. It's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. Unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. Even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. The guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. It's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. All the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. And to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

""What are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. The beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. Their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. When the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. Here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. On a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. A cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. The beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""That's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" The man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

While he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""The best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. You can never get tired of it!""

Sadly, this proved not to be true. After only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. But he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. This time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. Well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. After ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. He went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

And wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. The man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. Once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""Come,"" the beggar told him, ""I'll take you to the evening meal."" So the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. Even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. And sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. One of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. Three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""That's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals FOUR times a year!""

The man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. Four changes a year was enough for him. But one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. Well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""What is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what I have here?"" That question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. He was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

Fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. When he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. The architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. To his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

The beggar laughed jovially. ""I got here only three years ago myself, but somehow I knew you would be right here behind me. I've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" Suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. The room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. Sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. An angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

Smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""That's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

""What is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

The beggar replied, ""There appears to be no punchline.""

WIBTA for telling a 'homophobe' that I've seen his Grindr account?,"For the sake of convenience, I'll call homophobe 'J'.

J and I used to be friends in school, until I came out as gay and he began to distance himself from me and spread rumors. He then started saying it was gross/wrong etc.

Years pass, and I'm scrolling through Grindr when I spot a faceless torso picture, unmistakably his due to a set of freckles on his chest, the username being his first initial, and the distance from me matching where he lives. His profile states that is hookup only, with no face pictures given.

I think to myself ""Oh, he came out, good for him."" Then I look at his FaceBook. He's still spouting homophobia, sharing LGBT stories with his own opinions etc, and harrassing LGBT people that he comes across online.

So, WIBTA to tell him if I found his profile and recognized him, many of the people he's insulted could easily find him as well?

AITA for not shaving my legs for work?,"So I'm a 21 year old female. I feel like I should say these thing about myself because these are usually what people ask or say when they find out I rarely shave my legs. I'm straight, I'm very feminine, and I just don't like to waste my time or money on shaving my legs. Also I'm not a hairy person at all! You can barley see my leg hair, arm hair or even my god damn eyebrows. The only time I shave is when I'm dating a new guy in my life and I've been with my current BF for 3 years now. Also he doesn't give a rats ass if I shave my legs. 

So I work for a promotion company where I travel and work at event and festivals. But today I had to go into the office to grab some materials and my boss was there in his office so I stoped to say hi before I left out. 

When I ducked in he awkwardly asked me if we could talk about something. I said sure and came in and he shut the door. He was so red and stuttering but finally he told me we needed to speak about hygiene. I was in literal shock. I was so embarrassed and asked him what he meant. My boss then proceeded to tell me that a few people complained I didn't shave my legs and they said it went against company policy that I wasn't being hygienic. I was even more shocked. 

I told him I didn't understand what that had to do with me shaving my legs and he was just absolutely quiet. I asked him if he shaved his legs and he still said nothing. I then stood up and said if we were gonna keep talking about this I'd prefer HR to be there and he just told me that we didn't need to discuss it any further. 

Later today I just got an email from HR saying that they would like to set up a meeting for next week to talk further about the discussion that happened today. I'm freaking out and it's making me so anxious.

TIFU by accidentally selling my boudoir photo shoot to a drunk pervert,"Edit #2: I can't handle all the requests to see the photos, so [here](https://giphy.com/gifs/middle-finger-mister-rogers-fred-44Eq3Ab5LPYn6). They're not anything special. 

Edit: Jesus Christ. 1) I admit I was dumb and fucked up, yo. Hence this sub. 2) The officer said he wouldn't have gone if he had other things to do, so I didn't exactly waste his time. He said it was unsafe for a stranger to have the compromising photos of me so he understood why I wanted them back. 3) A boudoir shoot is actually a pretty common thing. It is not ""porn"" and I can't believe some of y'all are defending this creep. 

This happened a few months ago. Sold our entire bedroom set because we were getting a new one to a nice man in his 60s. He picked up, paid, and all was well. 

A few hours later he messaged me on Facebook asking if the pictures were of me. Holy shit, I'd forgotten to clean everything out of the nightstand, which still contained a boudoir photo shoot I'd given my husband for our wedding. 

Hella embarrassed, I explained what he'd found and that I would be willing to meet him to pick up the album. Except now he starts being a creepy asshole and sending wink faces and saying he wants to keep it. The back and forth angry messaging was doing no good. He stopped responding after I threatened to get the cops involved. 

So I call the cops and they say there's not really anything they can do unless he starts actively harassing me; as I sold him the nightstand with the photos in it, they were technically his property. Eventually an officer went to his house as a courtesy to me and asked if he'd be willing to return the pictures, which he did. The officer drove to my place and returned them, saying the man was quite drunk and upset that I'd sent the police over.

Accidentally played porn at my girlfriends sisters wedding...,"Hi Reddit, 

I always read items on this sub bust never thought I'd be posting on it, especially about this...

So here's the context, my girlfriends sisters wedding was on the weekend. They were having a fairly low key wedding and I offered to help where I could, setting up the reception area etc which was all fine. I work at a gym so we have a portable PA system with microphone for the group fitness classes. They were going to hire a PA system but I told them to save the money and I'll let them borrow the one from my gym, I set it up so the grooms phone would connect via Bluetooth as all he wanted to do was play a Spotify playlist throughout the night and use the PA for the speeches. 

On the day everything was going fine, everyone was seated and went quiet for the groom to talk so someone turned the PA system on. This is where it all went horribly wrong... my phone automatically connected to the speaker and started playing what was on my phone last... this happened to be porn from the night before, porn sounds started playing from speaker in front of everyone including the brides and grooms families... I grabbed my phone out of my pocket to stop the sounds, the groom laughed slightly and continued... my girlfriend saw me get out my phone and press pause on it so she clearly knew that porn was coming from my phone. She didn't say anything at the time however I went home and now she isn't responding to any of my messages and I don't know what to do? Do I leave it for a few days or keep trying to get in touch with her. Any advice would help I don't know what to do... ",relationship_advice

&#x200B;

I messed up and didn't take the biggest piece of advice given to me repeatedly on my previous post: ""get a lawyer"". I thought I could just respond to the lawsuit citing anti-SLAPP laws in CT, fax over the form and wait for the dismissal letter in the mail...

Weeks ago, I discovered that they had not received my response and if it wasn't mailed on time It would be too late. I paid for overnight mail and it was received on time according to the person on the phone. Weeks later I receive a letter with a date for my court ""hearing"".

I went to this hearing and thankfully the judge stopped my former boss and his lawyer (who also brought a new employee to testify??!?) mid testimony and asked me if I understood what was happening because ""normally the defendant doesn't show up for this.""

The judge kindly explained to me that I had already lost by default for not responding, and they were here to determine how much money I owe in damages. I pulled out a copy of my response, and the case was continued. Today I filed the proper motion and paid a fine of $130 to re-open the case against me in the clerks office at the court house. I was told to wait for a response in the mail. I am also getting a lawyer if I can afford it.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I didn't get a lawyer and filed the paperwork myself. It wasn't received by the court in time and I lost by default. The judge stopped the hearing because it was obvious I came ready to defend myself even though I had already lost.  If you give a 1 star google review, run it by your attorney first.

How do I help my underage cousin get an abortion in Mississippi? Update: it's done. Thanks /r/legaladvice,"https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ze596/how_do_i_help_my_underage_cousin_get_an_abortion/

I'd like to thank you for your excellent advice which allowed us to help our cousin.

A few days after my post we asked her parents to allow her to come with me and my brother to DC as a cousin bonding trip. They were open to it and even ended up paying for her ticket and driving all of us to the airport.

We took mandatory pictures at all the usual places to make it seem genuine and then went onto the abortion clinic which we had previously booked an appointment. Everything went smoothly and the abortion was performed. The next day our cousin wasn't feeling well but we had a day for her to rest before coming back so it was fine. We paid for the abortion ourselves although her parents giving us money to spend for this trip helped cover most of the cost anyway as we didn't really do anything else so we didn't need much money.

Thanks again. Now that it's over and the abortion is behind her and she's recovered I've had a chat with her about birth control and we're making sure this doesn't happen again (unless she herself wants to get pregnant, of course!). She has also dumped her boyfriend who completely ghosted her ever since hearing she's pregnant.",legaladvice
[NE] HOA towed away my car and built a chainlink fence on my land,"So this is part 3 and most likely the final update for now.

Link to past: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7cirxu/continued_ne_sold_land_around_my_house_to_a/


So I was away for the holidays and I came back on Monday to find my project car was towed out of my driveway, my pond was emptied out and filled with gravel and sand and a fenced off 2 acres (2 chains by one furlong) of my property closest to HOA. I immediately called the police and filed a report regarding the stolen property. The car wasn't registered and was just an empty shell so I have no idea where it is nor will it be easy to track. It's not worth a lot (maybe $2,500?) but it's the principle of that jackass president of the HOA.


I had my lawyer draft up the C&D and sent it nearly 2 weeks ago and they haven't contacted me in any way except this. I hired a local salvage company to come tear up the fence this weekend and they are doing it free of charge since I'm letting them keep the fence to sell as scrap metal or whatever they do with it. 

My lawyer suggested I send up a letter demanding payment to fix my pond as it was filled in with gravel and sand. A local landscape company quoted me nearly $8,000 to get the pond back to the way it was so that is what he suggested I ask and another $2,000 for loss of use of the pond. The HOA has lawyered up so I think it's best I no longer post anything else on here until it's settled. I didn't want to leave you all without some closure since you all have been an amazing help. I've put a picture of the layout since a few people asked. It's bad but should convey the land.

AITA for telling my parents I won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?,"I'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. I have a car that I bought with money I'd saved from work, and I pay my own gas. However my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

They said I need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. And the problem is that I get motion sick easily; even when I'm driving. Too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when I'm in a car make me feel ill too.

I'm not exaggerating, I've always been like this. As a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. I always make sure I know where my barf bag is on a plane. I always used to take motion sickness pills, but I'm not allowed when I'm driving because they make you tired.

Anyway, I can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me I literally feel so sick because of his BO. Even with the windows on my side open

My friend told me I should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

Right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

So I did that and told my mom and dad that I couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. Either they could check or I would. And they blew up at me saying that I was being nasty and humiliating, that if I wouldn't drive my brother I couldn't drive. And I said fine; I'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

And that caused a big fight, because I guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

"LPT: Daily use of the art of UPOD (under-promising, over-delivering) will help your life. Tell your S.O. that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 6:30pm, doghouse. Tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 6:30, hero. 50% of successful relationships are about managing expectations.","Under-promise, over-deliver (UPOD).  Not new advice, I know, but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this.    These are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children, my successful career in the pursuit of an M.D. Ph.D. in Neuroscience/Neurology, my marriage of almost 12 years, and even my self-confidence (yes, I under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations).  

1.) Realize that under-promising and over-delivering **is not an attempt to be dishonest, it can actually be more honest**, giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up (traffic, health issues, the other obligation you hadn't originally factored in). People often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them. 

2.) UPOD only works in relationships in the long term if **the under-promise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place**.  You shouldn't tell your SO that you will be home at 10pm every evening, and show up at 6:30pm every day, as 6:30pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say, and what you say will lose credibility.

3.)  **Don't over-promise to try to initially impress someone**, it will hurt you in the end.  If you are like me, you want others to think highly of you, which might tempt you to ""offer"" to do something quicker or much better than you probably can't do (or only can do under ideal circumstances).  This is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships.  Although this might work out for you initially (you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone), it comes with some natural consequences that are nobody's fault but your own.  First of all, you have now set the bar very high for yourself, making it difficult to over UPOD with them again.  Many will, going forward, expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward.  Second, even if you somehow manage to keep it up, you will eventually OPUD (Over promise and under deliver), which can really hurt you in the end.  You might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you (even though in truth, you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place).  

4.) When starting out, **Buffer UPOD with ""I wish"" statements**.  I have 4 kids, and with my M.D. Ph.D. training, I literally cannot make it to all of my children's extracurricular events.  At the beginning of each school year, I remind my kids that although I wish I could make it to every event, I will not be able to attend everything. Every time I show up, my kids are totally stoked.  I sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know I can make it to an event (even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up) just to manage expectations.  Although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me, or trust me, I have found quite the opposite.  I have an almost 100% success rate at being to the things that I say I will be at. 

5.) When employing UPOD, **Focus conversations on what you know 100% that you can do.**  For instance, when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably don't have time to attend, reply with ""I really wish I could go, but I probably can't.  Could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learned/shared at the conference?""   When a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do, let them know ""I will check with the Chef to see if I can do this for you, but it is unlikely that we can do this.  However, I can bring you some free extra breadsticks that I can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening.""   

6.)  **You can maintain an optimistic attitude while still UPOD-ing to yourself**.  I just realized that UPOD-ing yourself sounds really weird, but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself, and to give yourself some buffer.  I used to always tell myself that I would get more work/homework done over Christmas vacation.  Turns out, I was always disappointed at how much I actually got done.  Now, before the break, I tell myself I will be happy to get 10 or so hours' worth of work done each vacation period. If I get more done, I am pretty proud of myself.   For instance, even though I spent about an hour putting this post together, I am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people, with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point.  This is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success I have, it is worth it (also, I plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family).   

7.) **Under-expect in your own relationships with others**, and give people a break.  Realize that thing come up, and that everyone is fighting a hard battle.  Teach them, in gentle ways, how to UPOD. 

8.) **In some instances, it is okay to let them know that you are UPOD-ing**.  Example, tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening, but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work (because he usually does on a Friday evening).  I say ""some instances"" because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you, especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension.  For example, for some, when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of, people become suspicious or resentful of that person.  For instance, you don't need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later, just quote them 5-minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early.  

I apologize if this felt like a lecture, I just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before I had to learn many of these caveats the hard way.    Thanks for those of you that made it through all of this, I am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of UPOD.

Tl;DR:  Under-promising and over-delivering has helped my life, and will help your life, but there is an art to it.

Banned from the local bus for not giving up my seat.,"in a bit of a rush today so im just going to copy the story from my r/amitheasshole post: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/9zfdq3/aita_for_not_giving_up_my_bus_seat/?ref=share&ref_source=link)

I used to take the bus daily to get to work. Not a big deal, I'd just mind my own business, sit wherever there is the least amount of people.

But every thursday was awful. Every single thursday at the stop after i get on, a giant crowd of what i assume to be the mentally challenged kids from the local school would ride the bus too, about 7 or 8 with the woman i assumed was watching over them. Still, generally not an issue because I'd just put my earbuds in and stay in my own space.

But this bus company was not reliable. We have a nice, modern bus that could sit probably 15 people. One day, a little school bus came instead. It had 9 seats. Since that point, it was basically up to chance whether or not the big bus came. So you can see the issue when the bus rolls up to the stop and there isnt enough seats.

I have a heart condition, and moderately severe muscular dystrophy. Considering the 15 minute walk to the bus stop, I needed that time to sit down. So, that's what I was doing, as always.

The group gets on the bus, I've got my eyes shut with my music playing when the woman in charge taps on my shoulder. I look and she looks pissed, notioning to one of the younger ones, crying because he didn't have a seat. I take out my earbuds and she says to me that I need to give up my seat. The other people that were on the bus already were older than me, and when I tell her I need it she says that I need to respect 'my elders' and do what she says. I try my best to explain that medically I can't stand the entire ride and she gets upset with me and says I'm making it up and 'ignoring her' (i had headphones on when she was trying to talk to me i guess). So after a couple minutes of this I snap and tell her that he can stand and respect me as I'm older than him and that one of the other kids can give him their seat if it's so important. She gives me a look like I just murdered her cat and stops bothering me.

Two days later when I tried to get on the bus I was told I was banned from the service.

When I called them they said that it's a part of their policy that the ""fully abled"" must give up their seats to those that aren't. I explained the medical reasons I needed it and was simply told I have a lower priority because I'm ""fully functional"" and the boy in question wasn't, even though it was just mentally as far as I ever knew. He ended up standing the entire ride and it didn't seem to effect him as far as I know, but I feel like making a mentally handicapped child cry makes me the asshole.

On my original post it was suggested a lot that I make a post here. I live in Ontario, Canada. I don't have a lawyer but my mom has one she said would help me out, though he is currently out of town. I know almost nothing about the legality of what happened.

Anyway that's why I'm here for help. Am I in the right to sue? For how much? I don't know much about the legality of the situation and in general don't study law.

EDIT: There's a lot of responses on here so I'm sorry if I don't get to everyone, but for now I will pursue u/andthatswhathappened's advice and call the Ontario Human Rights Legal Support Center on Monday. Thanks everyone. I'll still be accepting further advice if there is more I should do though obviously I can't chase after compensation through more than one place.

EDIT: I gave them a call. It went well, should be covered from here. Thanks all.",legaladvice
TIFU by letting a guy use my bathroom during our garage sale,"Happened over the summer.

So, we're in the process of moving and I figure now is a good time to unload most of the stuff my wife and I have collected over the years- which is a lot considering we have children. Last weekend we had a pseudo-estate sale in which was staged in half of the house, driveway, and garage. Considering it was about 1,000 degree outside, I took the garage while my wife manned the inside post. Midway through the day, an elderly gentleman asked if he could you my bathroom- he explained he just took medicine and didn't think he'd be able to make it home. Now, my wife and I had serious rules about this- our answer was supposed to be NO BATHROOM for customers. However, I had to make a snap judgement call and this guy looked very well put together. I also thought that he just took a water pill that lots of old folks are on and he just needed to take a quick squirt and we'd all be fat, dumb, and happy. But I'm not a complete idiot. I told him he'd better check with The Boss upstairs because of the aforementioned agreement. He chuckled and understood and away he went. 10 minutes or so later, I see him leaving. I figured all is well.
A few minutes after that, my wife comes down to the driveway glaring at me. I assumed it was because I shirked the responsibility of telling this old guy no bathroom and made her look like the bad guy if she said ""no"". I couldn't be more wrong. Apparently this guy had a colostomy bag and it was chock full of shit. He tried to change it out in our bathroom and spilled the entire contents all over the floor and made no attempt to clean it up. He simply walked out of the bathroom and told my wife our dog must have had an accident. He. Blamed. My. Dog.",tifu
TIFU by accidentally putting mentos and diet coke in my mouth at the same time in a foreign country,"Being half japanese, I take a trip to Japan every two years with my dad to visit relatives, sightseeing etc. Unfortunately I was never actually taught Japanese so having my dad there with me is super useful when I need assistance. On our trips my dad usually takes a day to go hangout with his old friends (we live in the US) and usually leaves me at our hotel or whatever. Today was one of those days. While laying in bed watching Pewdiepie's minecraft videos I got quite hungry and thought to myself ""I can go down to the convenience store and get some snacks by myself right?"" Normally, yes. So I take a couple thousand yen that my dad left me and walk to the nearest family mart (for those of you who don't know it's a japanese convenience store.) I browse the shelves a bit and up buying a bento meal, mentos, and a diet coke. Checking out goes fine since I don't really need to communicate, just hand over money. So as I walk back to my hotel in the middle of a crowded sidewalk my dumbass decided to pop a few mentos in my mouth just because. So I suck on those for a while and than without even thinking about the consequences I take a HUGE swig of diet coke, like so big that i can't swallow all of it and it's just sitting in my mouth. Than all of a sudden so feel a very weird foaming in my mouth. Than it hits me. I remember the experiments I did in elementary school, the crazy russian hacker vids, etc. That was the very moment I knew I fucked up. So before I can think literally anything else it's foaming out of my mouth and I choke a little and end up just spewing out this diet coke foam. So obviously the people around me notice and come up to me and start speaking japanese. And of course I am sitting there, completely clueless. They were probably asking me if I needed help? I am dying of sheer embarrassment so I deadass just bolt back to my hotel with foam dripping down my face and clothes, im feeling sticky everywhere and life is not good. Once I get back to my hotel room and start to settle in I remember that I left my actual food on the sidewalk. So I just ended up starving until my dad came home and brought some leftovers. 

TL;DR: I mixed mentos and diet coke into my mouth in front of a bunch of people who didn't speak the same language as me and sheer embarrassment ensued.",tifu

UPDATE: AITA for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?,"This is the original post: /r/AmItheAsshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

I first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. It honestly helped me so much and without it I don't know if I'd end up in this position.

So I went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. They of course said no. I'm kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. Afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he'd come to me if it meant so much. However he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn't work he'd definitely accompany me to the principals office.

So I went to my teacher. I already knew how everything was going to go out so I didn't have any hope. I told her that I don't appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues I would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the Mrs.). She told me that I was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. I told her that many people don't think she's fair and in return she just looked confused. I handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she's my English teacher). Her face went from nothing to just sadness. I swear it was so weird. It's like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

She apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. And saying my name just gets her bad memories I guess? She told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. At this point I kinda felt guilty because I never took this thought into consideration.

She told me she'd try to say my name ( and won't cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime I can still call her by her first name. ( All my classmates are jealous because I'm the only person allowed lol)

We've talked about the past detentions she's given me and she said she'll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

Honestly this isn't how I thought things were going to turn out. And I'm pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for ordering a meat dish while eating with my vegan friend.,"Yesterday my friend 
/acquaintance and I went to a restaurant after work. She is a vegan and ordered a vegan dish. I ordered something that contained beef. 

When my dish came, my friend was shocked to see that it contained meat because she assumed that it didn't (for some reason). She said she no longer felt comfortable eating at the same table as me unless I sent the food back. I said no way I was going to do that.

She said ""maybe we can reschedule"" and that she was sorry but she could not eat with someone who was eating meat.

I said ok maybe we can get our food packed up. We did and then she said she wasnt feeling good and had to go back to her hotel. So I just sat on a bench in the park and ate my food by myself. It was really weird.

TIFU by letting my boyfriend have control over the lube.,"We are in the middle of the Polar Vortex. I got a phone call last night saying that I didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.

We decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. Well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. I was ready to get laid, because, well, I wanted to. So I told my boyfriend to grab the lube while I climbed on top of him.

The bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it [like this](https://i.imgur.com/llIJq5V.jpg). I was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

Because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. He squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. Again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

While he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. He couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as I screamed and jumped off him.  The bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

I now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. We sobered up real quick, I fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

AITA for thinking a divorce announcement due to an affair was an April fools joke?,"Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.

So here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. 

I immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. 

We were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.


Chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. 

Both families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

Anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

I broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I've ever seen but I wasn't falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

Being the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. 

Everyone in the room looked horrified. 

My mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

Tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. 


The rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


I am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag.

TIFU By telling my best friend I love her when I thought I was going to die,"Throwaway because I don't want this to be on my main account:


Obbligatory ""This didn't happen today but happened last week yadda yadda yadda""

Also please forgive my spelling mistakes because I'm in the hospital and writing this on mobile out of boredom of there being not much to do here.

So, last week I was driving casually on the country road close to my house on holiday back home for the summer after my second year of college. I wasn't paying too much attention (I assume some responsibility) and wasn't wearing a seat belt. Yes I'm an idiot I know lesson learned. WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS KIDS! Anyway, it was just starting to rain and I saw a KID ABOUT TO GO INTO THE ROAD. For the life of me I still don't know why he thought it would he a good idea to go onto a quite highly trafficked country road so casually, but eh life is full of surprises. I was caught completely off guard and swerved into the opposing lane to avoid him, and promptly got hit head on by the car coming towards me.

Now, I was going quite fast and as I said, did not have a seat belt on. Next thing I knew I was out of my car and couldn't feel anything anymore. No pain, no panic, nothing. I just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush I've ever had in my life. I just laid there, not knowing what to do. I heard voices come towards me but didn't really know what they were saying, and couldn't really respond. I thought I was going to die. There was a lot of blood.

You know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die? Well that didn't quite happen but I did start thinking about who I care about and who I love. Here's where I tell you about my best friend. A girl I've been in love with for around two years, I never let her know and never intended too. She is in a happy relationship she's had since her teens and I didn't want to ruin it, and if she's happy I'm happy. There's no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren't meant to be. But I thought I was literally dying, and all I could think about was her in those moments. The pain was starting to kick in but I was just thinking about how she'd never know how much I loved her.

I realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force I could muster I took it out. It was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message I could sent was an ""I love you"" to her. I thought that would be the last message I'd ever send.

I don't remember much after that. Days have been a blur. I've had quite a few operations, AKI due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. But my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like I got in a fight with a lion but it's slowly improving! All I do is sleep and appreciate the fact I'm alive. The other driver and the kid were okay btw.
Anyway, as you can see, I did indeed live and didn't die (so far), but I can't undo that message I sent. I've been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven't had the energy to confront the situation. I told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. Earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. I haven't replied yet and I don't want to. I don't know what to do. So far I've been writing this TIFU as procrastination and then after this I plan on taking a long nap. Thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.



TLDR: Got in a car accident and while I was bleeding out I told my crush best friend I love her. She's in a 10 year relationship and I haven't talked to her about it since and it's destroying me.

So I spoke to her... Over the phone because we're college friends and she lives far away right now. I decided that the best thing I could do at this point was just tell her the truth. I didn't expect anything and I didn't want anything to come out of it, but I just thought that to have a pure and true friendship everything needs to be out there or it just wouldn't be legitimate. I would love to tell you guys an amazing fairytail story that would give you guys all hope for the future and whatnot, but I guess life is just different from movies...

I told her how I felt in pretty much the same words as in this post. But I also added, and it's true, that I've gotten to know her boyfriend for the past few years and he's great. I don't want to hurt him or interfere as much as I want her happy. I think she understood where I came from and the circumstances in which those words were said. I hope nothing will change with her because I love spending time with her and neither of us can immagine life without eachother anymore, we both admitted that. So I guess I just have to give you the boring response... But it's reality so sorry if it sucks... Im okay with though, I really didn't expect anything and still kind of think I was being selfish. We talked about a lot of other things like we normally do for a couple of hours after that and she might be coming to visit me in the hospital this weekend! She said she'll try and make the trip, even though I told her not to because it's gonna be extremely expensive for her last minute... She was really flattered though I think and almost cried thinking she was the last thing I thought about when I thought I was going to die",tifu

A mega church next to my home plays music at high volume,"I live in Lawrenceville, GA and there's a mega church next to my neighborhood that plays music at volumes distinctly audible at over 400'. My wife and I have tried to speak with them to no avail and there is a paper trail of police action going back at least 4 months.

The Gwinnett County statutes say that anything able to be heard by a person of reasonable hearing (I have a massive amount of hearing damage from my time overseas) over 50' is illegal unless it's construction which is 300'.

Do I need to go ahead and continue to gather evidence of the hours and volume then retain a civil attorney? Is this something I can take before the judge myself since even the police here have said they are flagrantly disregarding the law but can only ask them to turn it down?",legaladvice
I snooped on my brother and found something horrifying,"I just found something pretty disturbing, and I'm not sure what really to do next.

My brother is usually a super private person and doesn't hand out his phone to anyone. We're currently on a family vacation overseas and he is the only one with a working data plan, so we've been using is phone quite a bit. His open web tab was on a popular fiction website, and I saw his logged in username before he swapped tabs to a new one.

I frequent the site too, and when back in the airbnb, went to check his profile to see if he too ran in the same fandoms as me. I must admit that this situation is entirely my fault as I snooped. I know I shouldn't have, but I was so curious. To my surprise, he had a few published works, but when I opened one, I almost puked - his latest story was of a brother violently raping his sister in graphic detail, who had the same first name and general description as me, in a setting I recognised as my parent's house. He insulted my eldest sibling and also my parents in horrible ways too. I won't go into further detail but suffice to say it was the single most horrifying thing I've ever read. Ever.

Now I'm in the bathroom of this airbnb typing this and I'm not sure how I'm going to go out and face my family. Should I just ignore this? Is this normal and am I overreacting? I mean, everyone has their kinks and my brother has never, ever acted inappropriately towards me or anyone in my family in real life. Please tell me this is so.

Urgh. Moral of the story, don't snoop, never ends well.

Edit: I am 19F and my brother is 23M.

**Update**: Thank you to those who replied, I still have no idea what I'm going to do. I really do get that it is fiction, and I completely understand that part of the appeal is to push characters to extremes because it would never happen in real life. It would not have disturbed me at all if the people involved were literally any other fictional character, emphasis on the fictional. All I expected when I searched his profile was to find a list of his favorite fics and thought we could discuss any shared fandoms, and I know I shouldn't have gone looking. Didn't expect him to be an author, much less this. Sorry for the long para, it's late at night and I can't bring myself to sleep in the same room as my brothers, might just crash on the couch where I am at now. Also I'm planning to beg off tomorrow's planned tour, will catch up on sleep then.

**Next morning update**: The fam is out for the day, managed to stay back at the Airbnb & the wifi. There has been a split of opinions down below and there are many who think that the writings are just writings, and private. I think I will give him the benefit of the doubt this time. I don't think I have the stomach to upset everything if so. I'll be back out of the house for college soon, so there will be distance.

Update - Washington State: Neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. What can I do?,"[Previous Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5r4lco/washington_state_neighbor_is_currently_video/)

So a ton has happened since I last posted. I had mentioned in the comments that my neighbor had been basically using sound terrorism to harass us. I began a writing in a log of each event that occurred, with the time, the date, the description, if I called the police (I did for almost every one), and it began to show an alarming pattern‚Äîhe was playing sounds at random times of the night every single night. After each major event of sounds, I would drop off a written statement to my local police station for the code enforcement officer. The city was now looking at charging him for noise violations based on my complaints.

I took my three page log and copies of seven signed statements and finally had enough of the police taking their time to work on the case against my neighbor. I dropped $95 on paperwork to begin an anti-harassment order against my neighbor. I made sure to explicitly mention the camera pointed in my bedroom window and the ongoing noises.

He was served the temporary order that very day by the local police, and sure enough, the noises ramped up. Before our court date to discuss the anti-harassment order, we were subpoenaed to be witnesses for the noise violation. We also brought the former owner of the home as well as the person who lived on the other side of my neighbor as witnesses to his noise-making capabilities. My neighbor never showed to the court date, and at that point had $1,250 pending in tickets. His lawyer showed up an hour late and the judge graciously accepted his plea to move the date a month forward. Disappointment.

Then the date for the anti-harassment order came. Once again, my neighbor didn't show and his lawyer begged for more time to look over the case. The judge was just and said that everyone has a right to defend their first amendment rights, so he moved the court date for a month later as well. Disappointment number two.

The noises are continuing on the regular at this point and we are trying to record them as best as we can on our phones. It was really hard to do because the noises were short, and happened at random in the middle of the night.

The date for the second anti-harassment hearing arrived and finally, we saw our neighbor come through the courtroom and sit in the back. When it was our turn to explain the situation, we made sure to present our call log, our statements, and videos that we had as evidence against our neighbor. Our neighbor's lawyer tried to get us to give up the call log because he mentioned he was not aware of it before our court date. The judge basically told the lawyer to go fuck himself. The lawyer's only defense for my neighbor was that he worked long hours and couldn't possibly be awake in the middle of the night to terrorize us, and that conversely, WE were the ones making the noises. We then brought up the fact that our neighbor had a security camera pointed directly at our home, and he should have plenty of evidence to prove we were indeed the noisemakers. The judge very confidently approved our anti-harassment order stating no more noises, no more cameras in our windows or at us in general, and our neighbor is not allowed within 25 feet of us. He immediately moved the camera pointing in our bedroom window to being completely flush with the side of the house. Awesome!

This was great news. We finally achieved some peace! And then the date for the noise violation trial came. Just his lawyer showed up, and made a deal with the city lawyer that one ticket would be paid, in exchange for no appeal to our anti-harassment order and to throw out two tickets. It sucked, but they took the deal. Whatever.

And all seemed well.

Then, about a month after the anti-harassment order kicked in, the noises began, again. And the camera began to slowly point into our garage, back in the direction toward the bedroom window.

This time, the police noticed something more alarming.

A red light was going off in the tinted window directly below the camera on the outside of my neighbor's house. They shone their flashlight and spotted a lens. My neighbor had a camera inside his window pointed at my bedroom window the ENTIRE TIME the order was in place, and long before that.

The officers told us to stay quiet, don't be alarmed, but they now were actively seeking a search warrant for the property to seize any noise making equipment and to take down the cameras, as he had broken the order.

The next weekend, my neighbor was arrested and we got to sit outside on the front porch while they disassembled the cameras and seized speaker after speaker, megaphones, etc. from my neighbor's home. They said he had four foot of insulation surrounding the room with the camera, and the front door of the home was completely barred shut.

Unfortunately, they just seized the equipment and will eventually give it back. My neighbor was out of jail the next day, and since they didn't have a search warrant for his hard drives, they couldn't place any voyeurism charges, despite my insistence. They even mentioned they saw me and my husband on a laptop of his.

I'm just happy that the noises have stopped and as far as I know, no more hidden cameras. I'm just glad I could update this crazy situation for you guys. I'm sure I'm not out of the woods yet.

TL;DR: got an anti-harassment order and cameras were supposed to come down, neighbor was a creep and had a hidden camera for a month while the order was in place, probably longer. He got arrested and no more cameras.",legaladvice
TIFU by going to bed drunk.,"So last night I went out as I do every Saturday.
When I got there I met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than I could handle. After that I went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as I was trying to lay down on it ""just to rest for a moment"".

I woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. It was cold and I couldn't move it at all.
At first I didn't panic at all because this has happened to me before because I sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. However today I slept with my arm under the side of my body ( I got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. After about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement I woke up my parents and after I explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.

During my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.
However my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. After getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which I hope I never do again) I waited for the results. A little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. 

It appears that I have done damage to a nerve with my hip while I was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (I'm right handed) fingers . At first the doctor didn't know how I managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after I told him what I have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn't end up this badly.

Now I'm sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.

TL;DR: Drunkenly fell asleep in a bad position and permanently damaged my arm nerves.",tifu

UPDATE [CA] Parents took and sold my car and won't tell Me who to. What's the best step to take from now.,"Thanks for the replies when I [originally posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/77vzo6/ca_parents_took_and_sold_my_car_and_wont_tell_me/).

All I needed was a more with-it police officer. I went in person with all the documentation proving that my car is my vehicle and with my brother, and stated clearly that my car had been stolen and sold and we knew who did it. The officer I dealt with this time treated everything seriously and listened to us both.

I had my car back within two days. My parents had taken it and hadn't sold it like they claimed but were renting it to someone they knew. The car was retrieved from the rentee's house. I hadn't yet made a claim on it so it was returned to me the day after retrieval. My mother has been charged, and I've also been questioned about my parents drug use. I'm over the moon that what they did trying to rip me off has shone a light on more of their behavior. 

I'm still trying to gain clarity with my insurer about possible internal damage to the engine or transmission and having that thoroughly checked out, but that's beside the point.

As a bonus this was the last straw for my brother. He'd been still living under our parents thumb and this gave him enough reason to also cut them off and commit to acting against them. I have my car back and my brother back more than I did before.

TIFUpdate by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital,"Hey everyone. This happened a few weeks ago but I haven't had time and just wanted to make sure everything had settled down before updating.

[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvg72z/tifu_by_thinking_my_daughter_was_being_raped_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

In the original post I left out some details that caused a lot of confusion so I will clear those up now. When I went into the room I grabbed his shoulders and started screaming at him. He stood up and I pushed him down. I went over to my daughter to make sure she was okay and she was screaming that it was a fetish. Her bf was unconscious and we sat there trying to wake him up. He woke up and was conscious but was shocked/confused. He was wearing his jeans with his wiener out while they were having sex and was also shirtless, so I wrapped a blanket around him to cover his genitals and upper body and helped him into the car. In the car he zipped himself up and I gave him my sweater to wear. I realize now how my original post might sound like I was driving him around unconscious but I would have called the ambulance and not tried driving him myself as this would've been life or death so I'm sorry this was misleading. Hell, I probably wouldn't have been able to carry him to the car (I'm just a strong but average sized lady :P) Anyways, since he was conscious at the hospital they just had a nurse check up on him but he had to wait to see a doctor so he was in the ER for a while. 

The doctor did some scans and found that her bf (thankfully) didn't have any injuries. He said that most likely her bf fainted since he didn't hit anything on the way down and woke up shortly after. Her bf has also fainted before (long story) so thankfully he was unconscious due to the fainting and not the actual knockout. 

After the doctor determined he didn't have any injuries I called his parents to tell them, and they decided they didn't need to make the long trip. My daughter's bf begged me not to tell them the specifics of what had happened so we kept it at that.

For my daughter, we had a conversation about her kink. She says she has a safe word and has never had to use it and her bf always takes care of her after sex to make sure she is okay and loved. I told her that I didn't want her to be afraid to have sex at home because it's a safe place and I don't want her to feel bad over this. I installed a lock on her door as a little ""I'm sorry"" gift. I think this is something I should have done a while ago to give her some privacy, and I'm glad I've got that covered now. I also vowed to never have any surprise visits again. 

For her bf I got him a card, some chocolate, and I paid for him to have a night at an Airbnb with her so they could have a private night together. 

TLDR; everything worked out in the end. Boyfriend wasn't hurt, and daughter has a lock on her door now.",tifu

Someone Threatened to Kill me at the Gym,"I live in Brooklyn.

I was going to the gym and returned what looked like a forgotten phone to the desk.

The man came looking for his phone and I told him I brought it to the front desk.

He became EXTREMELY agitated and demanded me to go get it.

When I said no, he became more enraged and threatened to beat me up.

He threatened to kill me several times.

He broke my headphones and when I approached the front desk for help he snapped my phone in half.

He threatened me several times and said he would kill me/snap my neck like the phone.

No one at the gym batted an eye, said anything or helped.

He never punched me, because I reminded him of the cameras and the police, but he was extremely imposing and like I said did threaten to assault me several times per minute.

&#x200B;

My question is should I go to the cops?

I just don't know if the Brooklyn police will do anything and I am worried that he or his friends would actually assault me should I go to the police. 

I am also worried that the front desk might give away my information to him since he is a long time member. I think they only have my credit card info, but still.

AITA for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?,"I know from the title, it definitely sounds like I would be the asshole but please hear me out. I have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. My nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (I don't know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

Recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. The first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. He drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. My wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. He told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

This weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. His mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. He got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. When my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. I stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

Once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. Here's the part where I may be the asshole. I told my cousins I didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and I know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. I told them I couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. I apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. They didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

I guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that I should've been more understanding and that I was wrong to ask them to leave. 

Am I the asshole?

EDIT for added info: 

Thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. There's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when I saw how many had reached out to me), but I wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. The first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. My dad is an only child so the cousin I refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). I'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). The reason I refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. A lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, I don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. I apologize if it was misleading in my post. Without being specific, in the western state I was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. I call him my nephew because my cousin and I were close and I still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though I don't know how after this situation). 

2. Some have asked if I was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. The first time, I thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. Remember, in my mind he's my nephew and I never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. Regarding the situation that happened this weekend, I was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. I didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. I don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but I don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",AmItheAsshole

Some facts for y'all.

Bunnies are as much work as a cat, if not even more! (ok, it seems they are much more work than a cat)

They poop. A lot.

You need to clean their toilets. A Lot.

You need at least 2 Bunnies! (1 neutered male, 1 female can be Spayed*)


Bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny.

Bunnies are not for picking up! They are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up!

They need medical attention as much as dogs/cats if not even more.

You need to take care of their nails. (or the  vet you trust)

Update: AITA for refusing to wear a wig to my friend's wedding?,"The original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/c0xp8l/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_wig_to_my_friends/?st=JX7KR9P2&sh=bd95d6aa

So first of all, thank you so much for your replies and advice! I'm writing an update post because things ended up working out well, and because I want people to see my friend isn't actually a horrible person like people were saying she was.

I texted her asking if we could work things out over a phone call (we don't live in the same state, so our relationship is over phone and text). It turns out a lot of you were right and my friend was being pressured to ask me to wear a wig. Her future mother in law found out about my shaved head and pitched a fit. Like I said in a comment, my friend can be a huge pushover, and this woman is apparently a nightmare. She's also paying for vast majority of the wedding, so my friend felt even more beholden to what she wanted. That's why she told me she couldn't pay for the wig: mother in law refused to. Neither of them knew how expensive a good wig can be, my friend only found out when I told her over the phone. That's also why our dresses, shoes and makeup weren't covered. It turns out my friend is mortified by what she sees as her mother in law making her look cheap and greedy, but she didn't want to tell us that because she's already embarrassed to be relying on her mother in law's money. (Apparently it's her fianc√©'s family insisting on a huge extravagant wedding.) 

That's why her reasons didn't ring true to me as well. She didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me that her mother in law was being so judgmental of me, so she basically blurted out the first things that came into her head. She assured me she thinks I look great with short hair and apologized for making me think she thought I look bad. 

I know people will question how I can believe her, but I've been friends with her for nearly ten years and I give her the benefit of the doubt. We've been there for each other through a lot and really care about one another. 

I'm still side eyeing the plantation wedding but I didn't tell her that because she seemed so stressed out by essentially being bullied by her fianc√©'s family I didn't want to pile on. I do know for a fact that she only wanted that venue for the big oak trees all over the property, which are admittedly beautiful. I went to the plantation's website and they do acknowledge slavery's evils and even have a memorial to everyone who was enslaved there, so that makes me feel slightly better. 

I did tell her that asking me as a mixed girl to wear a blonde wig could be seen as racially insensitive and I explained why. She was horrified and apologized over and over sincerely. She wants to stand out from her bridesmaids in pictures, and she didn't even consider the racial implications of asking me because most of her bridesmaids are blonde. She's kind of oblivious to things like that (so are a lot of people!) but the few times I've had to point out something she said could be hurtful she's always been understanding instead of defensive. 

I decided I'm going to grow out my hair as much as possible for the wedding just to help her not get grief from her monster in law. It'll still be pretty short, so that's okay. She's fine with that too except she was worried I'll still have to deal with snide remarks from her fianc√©'s family. I reassured her that after nearly a decade with short hair I've pretty much heard it all. By the time we hung up I felt way better not only about the wedding, but about our friendship.",AmItheAsshole

[WI] My girlfriend's landlord just entered her house when he thought nobody was home.,"My girlfriends landlord entered her house after he talked to her as she was going to work. He believed nobody to. Be home, but I was here laying in bed. I woke up to him coming into the apartment to use the bathroom and then leaving. When I said something as he was leaving he ignored me. I text my girlfriend about it to see if she had given him permission to enter and she said no. He did have permission to enter the building at 11 am to show her apartment, but this was at 9:30 am and he had no tenant to sho the apartment to. He just came in, used the bathroom and left. He didn't even finish flushing the toilet. 

When I confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. He then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. And when I explained to him that I had every right to be there because I had permission from the tenant to be there, he said ""okay, I'll let you go this time."" 

My girlfriend feels uncomfortable here because he just entered the unit without her permission. How can we make sure he doesn't do this again? 

Also, the dude didn't even finish flushing the toilet and left a turd in it.

TIFU by getting a sexy surprise [NSFW],"Obligatory, this happened this past Wednesday. 

So I've been out of town the past few weeks, and my girlfriend kept talking about how she was working on a sexy role-play kind of outfit for when I got back. Well, color me stoked. I get home from my work trip, and alas, no surprise. No big deal, I figure it just didn't pan out. So this is Sunday, fast forward to Wednesday. 

Wednesday, I'm back at work.  Five o'clock rolls around, I go to my car, and I drive home. I walk in, and ooohh my god. The sexy surprise. My girlfriend in a maid lingerie costume (you know the type) waiting for me in our bedroom. FANTASTIC. We start going at it, maid costume comes off, she's on top, and I go to kind of pin her arms against her back, and bend her over top of me. Well, I was a bit aggressive about it. 

I proceed to body slam her onto myself, with her shoulder coming down into my mouth with a force AT LEAST equitable to the new naval rail gun. She asks if I'm alright, it's then I realize, no, no, I'm not alright. I taste iron in my mouth, and realize that, sure enough, she's dislodged one of my teeth. It's literally lying parallel in my mouth.  Not to be outdone, I tell her sure, I'm fine, rip the tooth back into place (or as close as possible), and try to keep going. She doesn't say anything at first, then she informs me that apparently I've got blood all over my mouth. She was not really into that, apparently. 

I don't have dental insurance, so I go to the ER, and regale the staff there with my sexual misadventure. Missed work the next day, while arguing with insurance and going to the dentist. It's been quite the surprise.

tl/dr: Girlfriend's sexual surprise ends with me losing a tooth and completely blue balled. 

EDIT: Showed this to my girlfriend, she wanted me to update to include that she took care of the blue ball situation when I got back from the hospital. 10/10.

Tifu by selling my nudes to my stepdad,"obligatory notice that this happened a couple of days ago, but I'm still recovering from it.



Let me introduce myself real quick.
I'm an ethot who sell nudes and feet pics. Been doing this for almost 6 months now , cuz life is hard and I need money. I've been reaaally discreet about it tho. My family is too traditional for a closet bisexual hoe like me, and if they were to find out, my head would be on a platter n I knew it. So me, the sneaky know it all I thought myself to be, continued selling nudes n living my best life until the major fuck up  happened.


2 months a ago, an elderly man DM'ed me on twitter  asking to be his sugar babe. Knowing the scammers that lurk around, I didn't give much attention to that. His profile was new n anon with a few tweets and no face (has body pics tho) , so my suspicion grew. Also, I'm not open about my ethotness on my twitter handle so when he DM'ed out of the blue it felt weird.

But this man was persistent. He DM'ed again after a couple of days, saying that he has noticed the paypigs that follow me and kinda know that I'm an ethot, and if I wasn't one he's sorry. I ignored again. But I was intrigued by this older man who has a decent TL so being the bitch I'm, I started stalking to know if he's legit or not. His page contained mostly political tweets and there was actual people interacting with him. My curiosity grew so I thought it'd be a good idea to text him back- and that's when it all started.


We both kept our anonymity and started having little chats. What started out as  sweet chats transitioned to mad dirty as days went by. He was extremely sweet n sincere . He bought a few of my nudes and then we started trading pics. Every night he sent me vids of him jerking off , n I sent him mine. We literally fucked each other virtually. He told he was 45 but his abs said 30 and I was excited to get his DMs every night. 18 y/o me somehow felt more valuable cuz  older man with a hot body found my itty bitty titties attractive. It went on like that for a month.

A week ago I got really horny at night n texted him . It was really late but he replied saying his wife is sleeping next to him, and can't sext. I , being the obnoxious dumb doodle I am, somehow thought it'd be a good idea for him to go to the bathroom n film . He did as I said .

I opened the video with the intention of masturbating, but boy, I was in for a surprise.

I noticed the tiles on the wall behind him. At first ,I felt numb , then a shockwave went through my entire freaking body. I recognize the tub. The tiles.The fuckin blue tiles. The same tub I used to bathe. Holy fucking shit. That used to be my fuckin room.

My mind went to dumb bitch mode for a while. I sat in my room clueless . Tf just happened? Did I trip? Was that my room? Or is my mind making up shit now? The doubt kept me sleepless thru the night. You know the feeling u get when it's your finals next day n you haven't learnt shit? That feeling.

But I wasn't gonna let the doubt kill me.So,to make sure (that I was wrong), the next day I asked him to give me a mirror selfie in his bathroom. And boy, was I right. He's in what used to be my bathroom. The bathroom that I first fucked in. Jesus.

I blocked him right away and sat down to process all the mess that happened. I physically revolted. I felt this thing where something goes glsbsks down your chest n abdomen. I virtually fucked my step dad. Tf is my life. I don't know what made me feel so disgusted, whether the fact that we used to sext or him cheating on my mom. I felt like telling my mom that he ain't what she thinks he is, but how will I ? We weren't as close as we used to be. Ever since she married him I kinda kept a distance. May be that's y I never realized that it was my stepdad. I've only met him in person just twice. Also, what evidence would I provide? I felt so disturbed, nauseated and obviously , emotionally scarred. How on earth will I ever face this man again?   Pretty sure he's wondering where i  dipped to. And kinda worried to invite them over to my place cuz HE KNOW MY DAMN CURTAINS AND WALLS.


TL;DR : sold nudes to stepdad and made him jerk off to me, and now  anxiety and embarrassment are strangling my fucking conscience.


Edit: since this blew up I think I should link the dm. It's literally 7:30 here n I haven't slept for over 24 hours so let me get some sleep first. I'll be back. Be ready for some laughs at my expense.

Edit3: I'm gonna take a chance by unblocking him. Wish me luck. Also sorry for addressing him as elderly. I'm pretty sure you've figured out by now that I'm dumb, so forgive me for that. English isn't my 1st language. (¬Ø‚Äï¬ØŸ•)

"Making a public tweet about someone sexually abusing you isn't brave, go to the police.","If you're ""brave"" enough to come forward and accuse someone publicly and have your followers shame them but don't have the balls to file an official police report than chances are you're full of shit.

Edit: i wrote this late. My wording shouldve been ""making a tweet instead of going to the police""

2nd Edit: to clear things up a bit with a bit of context since a lot of people have taken this personally. Ive seen a lot of people share their stories about their crappy experiences with cops but you guys at least tried which tells me that an actual crime happened. I'm talking about the people that don't even attempt to go to the cops and yet have no issue coming out on twitter and using their followers instead.
Recently in the Voice Acting scene a popular VA has been accused of sexual assault because he gets affectionate and hugs all his fans and sometimes pecks them on the cheek. Hes now being fired from everything and some of his fellow VAs are coming out saying that he sexually assaulted them too. They havent tried going to the police nor have they said anything other than the blanket term ""sexual assault"" which these days could be a hug. 
I've seen people say ""wow seeing this backlash i can see why its hard for women to come forward"" theres a big difference between going to the police and making a report and publicly going after someone that has a dedicated fan following. 
Apparently this has been happening for years but no one got a restraining order against him and no one is getting specific on what it is they did. They're ""brave"" enough to use a blanket term but they don't have the balls to say whether it was rape,grope etc and then they wonder why so many people don't believe them. ",unpopularopinion

"UPDATE - AITA for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?","A few months ago, I posted [this post]( https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/achoyx/aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting_to_go_to/) asking if I was an asshole for not wanting to take my girlfriend out to restaurants. It blew up. It ended up on Twitter. People shared it to Facebook.

The general consensus was, yes, that I am the asshole, and it just went downhill from there. A couple people told me to kill myself, so thanks for that. More than a couple people told me that they hoped my girlfriend broke up with me. 

Well.

After I posted - and proposed and was rejected - things got pretty awkward between us for the first time in five years. She started to get snappy at me easily, she stopped being as affectionate to me, she started making pretty much nothing but casserole. Everything changed - to clarify, she usually liked to make more involved food than casserole.

Then one day, like three weeks ago, she threw down the spoon she was using to serve the thousandth casserole this month, and snipped at me, ""Do you seriously fucking think that I *actually like* eating at Olive Garden?""

Guys, she saw the post. She was *furious*. 

She doesn't like Olive Garden - she'll eat there because the kids love it and it's cheap. I was right about the red sauce being non-acidic, but, well, in her words, ""she never developed a taste for pasta, she's Latino, do I ever see her make pasta? No. A meal isn't complete without rice. You don't know me at all.""

She yelled about Olive Garden for a solid twenty minutes. It wasn't just about Olive Garden, but it was a lot about Olive Garden.

Long story short, we've been separated for a few weeks now, and it's not looking good. She ""loves and respects me but feels it's best for her to respectfully disengage"" from me for her own personal betterment.

 So, yeah.

TL;DR: I ruined my family by not appreciating my girlfriend. I didn't take her out on dates and I didn't pay enough attention. I would do anything to fix everything.

Edit: To clarify a few things

1. I didn't post on April First.

2. I say that she yelled about ""mostly Olive Garden"" because she did. She was really embarrassed that a bunch of people on the internet were making fun of her over Olive Garden, where the kids are catered to.

3. She did not call herself Latino. She calls herself Latinx, but I thought Latino would be less confusing. Guess it just made me look like a dick.",AmItheAsshole

AITA for refusing to lift something heavy for a woman as a man?,"I was asked by a female coworker to lift something heavy in the kitchen while I was working at my desk, but when I got to the kitchen, it was filled with other women having a conversation during working hours. I was offended that she would go out of her way to ask me while I was working just because I was the nearest available man, so I refused. The other women were clearly offended by my decision and some thought I was joking, so I kept on refusing until one of the women gets fed up and lifts the dang thing with ease. I thought one of them should have done it in the first place.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: To clarify, the women in the break room weren't on official breaks. They just happened to be there because they all needed a second round of coffee and started a conversation amongst themselves. There are no official break times in my workplace. Also, I was working on something at my desk when I was asked to lift said object.

Edit 2: At the time of being asked, I was asked to help ""lift something"" in the break room. I assumed it was a package of mail or paper and I didn't know I'd be doing it myself, nor did I know it was merely to replace a five-gallon bottle of water for the water dispenser.

Edit 3: This was not the first time in the day I refilled the dispenser. I'm the closest man who sits near the break room, so I'm regularly asked by superiors to change it and am not in a place to refuse my boss. However, the woman who asked me is not a superior and isn't exactly petite either ‚Äî none of them in the break room are. Furthermore, the cap on the bottle is one of those that prevents spills by being pierced when it's placed on the dispenser. I have also witnessed a 4'11"" woman change the bottle, so height isn't exactly much of an issue here.

Edit 4: The woman who asked me does not have a poor relationship with the other women in the break room. She is also married with children and I'm the only openly gay man in the office, so, no, I highly doubt she was trying to flirt with me as suggested by some here.

Edit 5: I never lost my temper or became argumentative during all this, but some here assume I did. I just refused to do the task for her.

Edit 6: I am not the strongest person in the office ‚Äî far from it. I don't lift weights and stay slim out of preference. We even have some female gym fanatics here. Also, I barely know the woman who asked me. She's in another department in another part of the office.

UPDATE: I very much wanted your responses because of a follow-up discussion with one of my female coworkers who was within earshot when all this happened. She still defends chivalry, while I obviously find it illogical. Our office is currently going through a renovation and, while clearing out a storage room, we discovered our old water dispenser involved in all this. Yes, everything I posted happened almost a decade ago. Our discovery sparked a heated discussion and I wanted to put the issue on this subreddit for others' viewpoints to close our debate. I put little effort in my original post without thinking I'd get so many responses, so my apologies in advance for the list of edits.

I'm still employed with this company, and some involved have left. If there was any hostility towards me afterwards, it was not noticeable and certainly played no role in my eventual promotion. I'm glad to have played a part in changing the minds of my female colleagues. It's no longer a habit for them to look for a man when some physical exertion is involved, and I am often told by women to let them handle tasks once exclusively done by men. Our head of HR also announced in a staff meeting that we'll be employing more men to bridge the gender gap in our office, and some married coworkers told me they've even made positive changes at home as well ‚Äî all stemming from a seemingly petty ordeal.",AmItheAsshole

In April 2018, it looks like a credit card was opened in my name with the address of my former house, where we lived while we were together. I had literally no knowledge of the card or anything about it. The first I learned of it was last week when I was served and given a court date in July. I'm being sued by the credit card company for the balance and lawyer fees. Looking through the documents, it's clear as day she was the one who opened the card. I texted her telling her she needed to pay it and she at first acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. She finally admitted that she opened the card because she felt that I was still responsible for upkeep on the house and her car after the alimony ended. She said her mom told her it would be fine.

anyways, one night i just couldnt sleep, so i decided to take 4 10mg ambiens (im an idiot) and I had an engagement ring in my drawer than i traded for some other jewelery because i buy and sell stuff on craigslist. anyways, long story short i woke up and she was wearing the ring on her finger and had explained what had happened and i was just shook because i couldnt remember shit. I go on my facebook and apparently my ambien drugged brain changed my relationship status to engaged and it got 150+likes before i fuckin saw it.

TIFU by going down on my wife,"One of my favorite things to do is go down on my wife. I have a talented tongue and I like to use it. Last night I decided to make that experience even more mind-blowing for my wife by grabbing the dildo and fucking her with it at the same time. Fun times were being had by all and things were getting very hot and very wet. Then my wife started to orgasm and my hand slipped and the dildo shot out of her vagina and directly into my right eye. I pulled away and she asked what was wrong. Not wanting to stop there I told her not to worry about it and I would tell her after. We finish and I go to the bathroom to rinse my face (and eye) and tell her what happened. We both are laughing hard at this but I tell her jokingly ""your vagina just gave me pink eye!""

Well, today my eye was red, itchy, burning, and gross. I just left urgent care with drops for pink eye. My doctor thought it was hilarious and burned my ass on the way out saying ""now go to the pharmacy for your vagina drops!""

I always thought my first lesbian sex injury would be a broken finger.

LPT: Never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it.,"It may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve VS an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose (as the manager) which option you believe is best. 

In my experience when most employees come across a problem they don't know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response. 

This does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion, presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention.

Edit: Couple of things that have come up

1. Time frame - I wasn't suggesting withholding critical information from your superior, if you have 30 seconds to tell them, come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds, even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations. You can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them, you can't teach someone with no ideas how to have them.

2. Trivial Matters - Obviously don't bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job, it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make, if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager.

3. You should just make the decision yourself - In many situations this is correct from a pure ""efficiency"" standpoint but often if you don't take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous, it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works.

4. Management Perspective - I AM NOT currently a manager, over the past 20 years I have bounced back and forth between employer/employee in different companies, combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee, I am not complaining about my current situation, I am very happy and follow this LPT on a daily basis.

Edit 2: Thankyou all so much, I really didn't expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing, the other LPT I follow is ""Seek first to understand"" and you have all helped me (and hopefully others) to do just that.

"TIFU by performing the ""Major Tom"" technique and now I think I'm going to be disowned","If you aren't familiar with the ""Major Tom"", it's because it's a thing I (hopefully) came up with. It's a form of ""auto-erotic asphyxiation"" by using gravity.

Basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. This part is called ""Getting in the shuttle.""

As you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. This is considered ""Take off.""

If performed correctly, you should become VERY lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. This is called ""Being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

This is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **I, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. You see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. No oxygen = no consciousness.

When I ""Took off"" I fucking jumped up at Mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. Because the next thing I know I was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

Before I could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if I was okay. She heard my re-entry. This part is called ""Disappointing your mother.""

You can just imagine the scene she walked into.

She stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. I stared back with what I thought was confidence like I was Buzz Aldrin and just got back from the moon. But thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while I was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (At least not to my knowledge.)

She ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more Judge Judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. I cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. Somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and I managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

I'm currently writing this in my room right now, and I don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until I can think of what to say to her. If there is anything to say at all.

I had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but I still swiped out of boredom. They were listed about mid 30's, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. Couldn't see her face, but that didn't matter to me. Only boob. There was no picture of her husband. I take a few shots and message them.  After like an hour of talking, I decide to just do it. We never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. She wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. At first I was like really not for it, I originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, and I was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. At 2AM I left the house, and this is where I regret everything.

&#x200B;

After driving for about an hour, I miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped TWO of my tires. I'm in a shitty ghetto town that I've never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how I'm getting home now. I thought I was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. But since there was no turning back now, I decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.

The husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as I see him, my gut and inner voice are SCREAMING at me, don't do this, turn back. And I wish I had listened. For reasons unknown, I followed him into the house. It was pitch black, not a single light was on. He lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. I was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. If there was ever a time I disassociated, it was then and there. It was no longer me behind the wheel. The dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. Does anybody remember the scene in Blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? That was what I saw. A disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. I was horrified but at the same time, I didn't care. They both fucking STINK, that was one of the worst things. The smell took forever to wash off my hands after. Months later I'll get a whiff out of nowhere. That disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.

I take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking THE ENTIRE TIME, like fucking Gollum. Saying things like ""yeah it's been a while since she's had another. Look at that beautiful pussy. Ain't she so fuckin wet?"" Nonstop. Meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. Like I said before, it didn't feel like it was me at the wheel, I managed to perform to a degree but I never did finish. It probably didn't help I was wearing a condom but I'm extremely glad I was. The entire time there's about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.""How the fuck am I getting home? This smell is going to kill me. How do I end this? How do I get out of here?""

I decided it was time, I had to get the fuck out of there asap. I told them I couldn't cum, it wasn't going to happen. They insisted I put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn't want to offend them, obliged. I just wanted to make it look like I at least tried. If the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. I pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. I stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. I politely reiterated I wasn't going to be able to finish. I blamed it on my tires being popped and I was too tired. They were cool about it, and I quickly gathered my things and left.

I BARELY had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. So we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. My hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers I took and how many times I washed them. I blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what I did. It took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. Easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of Shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.

TIFU by breathing with one nostril my whole life.,"So let me give some context on how this happened, a while ago i tried out an e-cig my friend has and he made fun of how smoke only goes out of one of my nostrils,i didn't think much of it , i thought its just a stuffed nose.

So i try to clean my nose and its already not stuffed but yet again i didn't put much thought into it.
Yesterday i noticed that my right nostril is blocked again and my nose isn't stuffed, so i go look in the mirror to see that my right nostril is completely blocked by my septum.

I took a doctor appointment the next morning and as soon as he looked in he said i have septum deviation caused by breaking my nose at some point in my life when i was a kid and that it needed surgery.
I cant believe i've went for god knows how many years without realizing i wasn't breathing correctly and thinking that this was the norm.
Surgery is within 24hours so yeah, this escalated quickly.

TL;DR. i'm stupid and didn't realize my right nostril was blocked off by my septum for years.",tifu

TIFU: ALWAYS disconnect Bluetooth,"So yesterday the alternator on my car died, I went and picked up a new one today that I'm going to install this weekend. No biggie, but it meant I had to borrow my dads truck to go to work today. Now my dad has a newer pickup with a Bluetooth radio, so I synched my phone up, put on some music and went to work. 

Later, once I went home I decided to have some ""me"" time and watch some ""special video's"". Around the 4th video when I was really getting into it, the audio suddenly cut off. Puzzled, it took me a few seconds to realized the horror of what had happened.... My dad turned his truck on to go check the mail and was greeted with a full volume, near orgasm, porn moan when he did. 

When he got home, I was standing in the kitchen and awkwardly made eye contact with him and died a little inside. All he said was ""what the fuck son"". 

TL:DR- I borrowed my dads truck and synched my phone to it. Went home and watched porn and my dad was greeted with the sound of a moaning porn-star when he started his truck

Update!!! -My landlord called the cops on me for trying to pay my rent- cop made her let me pay- now I'm being evicted for non payment-Texas,"Thank you all so much for all the wonderful advice!!! I definitely feel more educated and informed about my rights now. 

I'm no longer being evicted and I got all of my late fees back as an account credit, except for $5, but at this point I don't even care to ask why.

He went through my account, got it paid, and refunded me $125 in late fees as a credit. I actually overpaid $5, still, but it's mostly a win without having to go to court.

The answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether I do it or not. Now I don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

Hi everyone

It's been several days since my post, and I really just wanted to say thank you to everyone who gave me their opinions and offered condolences. I appreciate your time and thoughts so much. Plus, reading through this thread was a great distraction and it helped me keep it together for my family when I was with with them... especially the snarky replies lol.

It has felt like a long week but I finally feel like I'm over the hurdle. Yesterday was the funeral, where my family asked me to speak. My cousins couldn't. The funeral was packed, and the overflow room in the funeral home was filled with people who loved my uncle.

My sisters fianc√© and my brothers girlfriend both came to support our family. I think that was one thing that really drove home the conclusions I came to earlier in the week. 

Through this whole week, my bf has not once asked how I feel or if I'm okay. My friends, coworkers, and acquaintances who knew my uncle have shown me more compassion.

I don't hate him, but he really took me down.

At first I was going to take the advice many people gave and just ghost him. It seemed like the easiest thing to do. I even deleted all of my events from our shared google calendar, and left group chats that we were both in. I blocked him on fb messenger but that only lasted like an hour before I realized that I'm not that person. Even though I was hurt and angry, I don't need to get even. 

On Thursday (the night before the visitation), I cracked and texted him asking him to just talk to me and explain what was happening, and then I went to sleep.

Part of me didn't think he'd respond, but in the morning he had sent me a long message explaining his perspective. 

He basically explained he doesn't handle grief or loss well due to past experiences (I understand), but then accused me of being like his ex-girlfriend and he can't go back to that and how I have to communicate.

I know I'm not winning any awards for communication. I'm afraid to speak my mind sometimes and that leads me to be passive aggressive or with festering issues. But how can I communicate with someone who doesn't respond to me or ask questions? I don't think he realizes it's a two way street.

We had a previous conversation where I explained to him that it was hard for me to express myself because of past trauma, and that I would try to improve but I would need him to be patient and call me out and ask me questions. This is what frustrated me the most.

I responded with a long message saying that I understand I reacted badly, but then explained my side and told him that his actions were hurtful especially because I really needed him and he rejected me. I needed support and he ignored me instead for being too emotional.

He said sorry, and asked if we can make up. I told him I don't know and that I couldn't think about it with everything else going on, so we're supposed to talk later this week.

The thing is, even though I understand his reaction a little better, it's not something I can accept or live with. As a lot of you pointed out, our communication styles are just too incompatible. I was willing to work towards bridging it, maybe because I didn't know where my line was. I definitely found the line this week.

Even his apology didn't show any concern for my well being. I know some of you pointed out it's a young relationship, but I think generic condolences are not a lot to ask for from a partner - especially as we knew each other as friends before. 

He took my pain this week and made it about himself, and then waited for me to make it better for him. If I hadn't messaged him Thursday, I truly doubt I would have heard from him at all. That kind of selfishness is not something I want in a friend or a partner.

So, whenever I get around to it, we're going to have to have that conversation. I'm pretty anxious about it and still sad, but I'm not willing to keep trying. If I did, I'd feel like I was selling myself out. 

If you read this far, thank you. I wasn't going to post this update because I felt self absorbed talking about myself like this. But I had a few private messages this week asking about what happened, so this seemed easiest.",relationship_advice

&#x200B;

Ok so I first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200B;

So after a week of avoiding I came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. She was happy to see me and I told her to sit down because we need to talk.

I started things with saying that I know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. Her face turned red and she started crying like hell. She knew what I was talking about. I told her the story about the DNA test, about Jennet and basically what I told you guys in the last post.

Well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. She told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. He didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". Apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

She told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. When the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. After a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. As they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. She tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when I started crying. She started crying too. The couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. Rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. Police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. We were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. It took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

Rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(They came to their senses after a day or so). She reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. She made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

A few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. After so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. He met me a few times and I knew him as one of Rose's old friends from the park. He helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. Ironically I'm glad I got to know him before he passed, even if I didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200B;

BTW, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200B;

So after hearing this I told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and I told her I understand she did the right thing. I pulled out an ""It's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and I headed off to my parents(ADOPTIVE) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200B;

I'm glad she is my mother. I feel for the first time in years - complete. I don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and I honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't.

I'm definitely pleasantly surprised this blew up like it did. Never knew that chip bag opening could be such a hot topic.

Aside from the seasoning (yeah, agreed that this only really happens with some chip types), the bigger part of this for me is that the little crunched up pieces fall into the big chips, so you get big chips that are topped with tiny more seasoned chips throughout the bag.

Also agree from a health standpoint, the better LPT is probably to eat fewer chips :-P But nothing wrong with treating yourself every now and then.

Bank gave away my entire banking account,"So last week, a check I wrote bounced from an account I have that I rarely use. It's a beneficiary account from when my grandfather died. I called the bank where I was informed that I closed the account to pay for ""my wedding"". I told them I sure as hell did not and have been married for 6 years. After them jerking me around ""are you sure you're not getting married"" ""did you maybe forget about taking that money for your wedding""...etc. I finally got them to open a fraud case. 

Here's the crazy part. I call and basically stalk them to get them to investigate. I finally speak with someone and what happened is they gave my money away to another woman with the same name. This woman opened a car loan with the bank and because we have the same name they just hooked her name to my account. She lives in Florida and I live in colorado. We do not have anything else in common but our 1st and last name. So she ends up calling the bank they ""assure her"" that money is hers and a relative left it to her so she rushes down and withdraws it all. I figured all this out before the bank did through some good old fashioned Facebook and internet stalking sent them the info, boom. Open and shut case.

So now, the bank has admitted fault (finally) and will restore the account. They asked me not to file a police report, which sort of makes sense (they after all encouraged her to take it) but I have no idea what personal info of mine she has, and was given to her. The icing on the cake was I got a letter from the bank yesterday with her personal info on it, including address, so now they've compromised both our info.

Do I have any legal recourse? Do I just shut up and hope she doesnt steal my identity and be glad they're giving my money back? What advice do you have?",legaladvice

I'm pregnant and I want to leave my husband [update],"Hi everyone,

I want to take a minute to say thank you to everyone who gave me advice and words of encouragement. I read every single comment on both threads about my situation and I really really appreciate the support and help. If not for the advice here, I probably would not have felt justified in leaving.

I'm sorry for taking so long to post, but I am now back home in NH with my parents. I feel like I'm coming out of a fog and I feel really stupid for believing everything; I guess I just justified it by assuming laws were different in the south.

I managed to withdraw half the balance of two out of three joint accounts. The third is a local bank and I did not want to stay in the area any longer. My parents told me to just leave the money. They are going to help me get the medical procedures I need and then they are going to help me pay for a divorce attorney. I thought they would say I told you so because they told me not to get married, but they have been very supportive and even offered to pay for me to go back to college and finish my degree.

TIFU by gluing my ass cheeks together before a long awaited date,"So there is this girl who lives a state away from me, and she had been planning to come visit me for three months. The plan was for her to come over when I got off work at 930am. 

I had worked three overnights in a row and I didn't have time to clean my apartment or get myself ready for her visit in the days prior due to being exhausted and/or at work.

Flash forward to this morning. I get off work around 825 and have an hour to get home and get ready before she gets there. 

I made it home and had 30 mins to spare. I decided that at most I needed 5 mins to shower so I figured I had time to clean up a little bit. As I'm finishing cleaning, about to get in the shower, she texts me and says she will be 15-20 minutes late. (This is where the cascading failures begin).

15-20 mins isn't a lot of time, but I thought it was enough to get my downstairs trimmed up, just in case things got physical. 

At first I tried to use an electric razor and it was going pretty well. It quickly turned to shit and cut my right nut twice in like 10 seconds. I decided that there is no way I could finish this without my manhood looking like a murder scene. 

I was panicking and had no idea what to do, seeing as she'd be there in less than 10 minutes and my undercarriage was in shambles. I went to put my razor away under the sink and noticed a box of self waxing strips that my friend had left behind when she was helping me wax my back. Perfect.

I didn't have time to read the directions, so I ripped to strips open and place them both into the middle of the jungle down there. I went to pull the first strip off and was greeted with extreme resistance and searing pain. Once again, I was too committed to not finishing and time was running out. I made the decision to rip the second strip off and just jump in the shower and hope that the encounter didn't turn physical.

As soon as I go to wash the wax from my nether regions I realize that an enormous amount of extremely sticky wax is still all over my crack. I frantically try every soap I had in my shower to get it off. I even tried to use a coffee ground face mask (that was unpleasant).

At this point, somehow the wax sticky factor had quadrupled and I was 2 minutes away from her arrival. 

I said fuck it and dried off and got dressed. 

She called me to say she was here and I got up to answer the door, when I realized that my boxers were stuck to my ass and that my ass cheeks were firmly stuck together. No time to figure it out now. 

We chatted for a while and things ended up moving into a physical direction. She could tell that I was wincing in pain when I moved around and she kept asking what was wrong. I played it off as muscle cramps.

This worked fine until she went to take off my boxers and could feel the resistance of the wax glue from my cheeks and crack.

She immediately looked concerned and I had no choice but to tell her what had gone down moments before her arrival. It has been a long time since I've been that embarrassed. 
 
The kicker is that once she stopped hysterically laughing at me, she pointed out that the wax kit comes with after wax removal wipes that I had failed to see during my frantic decision to wax in the first place.


TL,DR: I accidentally glued my ass cheeks together with a cheap self waxing kit, moments before a girl came over and I couldn't get the wax off my ass before she got there.

WIBTA for selling my son's home because they decided to be childfree?,"I know the title sounds bad but hear me out.

I'm 47F, my husband is 49M, my son is 28M, his fiancee is 27F.

When my son proposed, we talked to both he and his fiancee to find out their game plans for the future. We wanted to buy them a house but one question decided *how big*: do they plan on having children?

Their answer was ""yes"", so we did buy them a house, but kept it in our name. Because they were common-law at this point and not yet married, we worried what if they broke their engagement: if the house was in my son's name for example, she would be entitled to some of it. At least in our names, our family is protected. We think the world of his fiancee, this was just a devil's advocate, worst case scenario thing.

They've been engaged for two years and the wedding is coming up this October. But we were hit by a bombshell a couple of weeks ago that they no longer have any desire to have children. This is fine: we don't expect or assume anything, if they don't have kids, it's their life, we don't respect them any less for it. But it made my husband a little tiffed that we specifically bought them a big house under that assumption.

We would have bought them a smaller 2+1 bedroom or thereabouts if they planned on being childfree. But instead we were told children are in their future so we bought them a 5 bedroom home. This is like the difference of a factor of two. We spent our money needlessly.

I'm pushing my husband to sell the house because it's in our name still. My husband says it will create a rift between families but this whole thing was based on misinformation. I don't think they did it with malice ""hehe we get a bigger house if we lie"", but I think they knew they didn't want children. You don't be in a relationship for 8 years and don't have that conversation, right?

Would I be the asshole for selling their home? We'd get them a smaller one, of course, we just don't think they'll need anything bigger. They'd never be homeless.

**EDIT**

Just so it's clear, we don't mind or care if they have children or not. The problem is they have a larger house we bought specifically for a family. Children need extra space. Now that it's out of the question, they can make due with a smaller house.

Our other son is married to a wonderful man and we bought him a house, too. Same kind of scenario as this, they got a 2+1 bedroom house. In our names until they got married, then transferred to their name once married. This is how we're giving our two children wedding gifts. There's already been hubbub between my children ""why does x get a 5 bedroom home when we only got a 2 bedroom"", etc. ""Because they're having children"" can't be our reasoning anymore.",AmItheAsshole

In a lot of children's shows like Peppa Pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids,"Like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. The girls save the day. I don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. Like there's Barbie movies too in which Barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas Ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. A lot of kids shows are like this. The father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

In Peppa Pig, specifically, the father of Peppa is an engineer. He has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. It's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. Meanwhile ""Mommy Pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. The whole thing is pretty insidious.

From an early age it sends a message of girls being empowered, but how about the little boys? Like sure there's still superhero movies but those are aimed at a little older audience, plus all those superheroes are usually genetically mutated in some way and unrealistically handsome, so few kids would identify with them.",unpopularopinion

TIFU by teaching my 4 year old about static electricity,"So it was rather cold today and I put some nice, thick wool socks on my 4 year old son.  After running around a bit today, he came and gave me a hug.... Zaaap.  

I explained to him that he's got to pick up his feet because dragging them on the carpet will build up a ""shock"".  My son looks at me and says ""Like Pikachu?""

A bit of background.  A few months ago I discovered that Disney Now has the full run of all Pokemon episodes.  Like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  My son and I have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  My wife and I decided to get a Switch as a family gift for Christmas, along with Let's Go Pikachu.  For my son's birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a Pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  

So a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his Pikachu plushie.  Drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing Frostpunk and says ""Donder Shok!!"" while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  

As he runs away, clutching his plushie, all I can say to my wife was ""I think Pikachu's been teaching him some tricks"".  She was not amused.  



TL;DR - Pikachu taught my son Thunder Shock.  My wife is not happy about this development.

AITA for not trading seats on a plane?,"This happened a few days ago and my girlfriend thought I was a bit rude, but I thought I was completely justified.


So we booked tickets for an almost full flight and the only row with 2 seats near each other had someone that already booked the seat in the middle. I figured they did this because they didn't want anyone booking next to them, but they were the only seats left so I booked the window for myself and the aisle seat for my girlfriend. 


When we boarded the guy openly admits to booking the middle seat just so nobody would want to book seats next to someone sitting alone, he even stated that it usually works and he's very proud of it. Then he asked if I could give up my window seat to get to sit next to my girlfriend. I was admittedly a little upset that he openly admit to just taking the middle seat so nobody would sit next to him. I honestly didn't want to give up my window seat and my girlfriend didn't want to give up her aisle seat since that's what we both like. So we denied him, and he just comes at us with, ""you really don't want to sit next to your boyfriend or girlfriend, do you guys hate each other that much?"" I answered, ""no, we just really don't want to reward you for booking your seat like a dick.""


As I said my girlfriend said I was a little harsh and we could have switched seats, yeah it would have been nice to sit next to my girlfriend, but at the time she didn't want to sit next to me either.

UPDATE: AITA for arguing with my wife over her preferring to sleep with a body pillow over me?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/d8c3ic/aita_for_arguing_with_my_wife_over_her_preferring/

So a bit of a weird update since my wife actually saw this thread through her coworker. (e: to clarify, the coworker didn't know that it was about my wife, she was just sharing an interesting thread)

She texted me asking if I was looking to buy a new bed and I said yes without thinking much of it. She then linked me this thread and said we would talk later that night (not in a bad way).

We sat down and she apologized for calling me a baby and I apologized for starting a fight over something so small. 

She said that she really enjoys the pillow but we can get rid of it and sleep together instead. I told her this isn't necessary and that I would deal with it but she insisted. 

I've ordered her a new body pillow that just covers one side of her that she could put on the opposite side of me so hopefully everyone can be comfortable. 

Everything worked out and we have been sleeping together for the past couple weeks now. The new body pillow came in and is on the opposite side of her. She switches between me and the pillow every now and then and it's not a big deal. A lot more comfortable to sleep now too haha. 


Thanks to everyone who Pmed me giving me advice as well as those giving advice in the comments. 

I tried to emphasize this as much as I could in the comments but seriously my wife and I never fight and this was extremely out of the norm for us. 

Everything is good now though and we are going to start doing date nights again on Saturday and it's been going well. Feels more like our relationship when it was just starting out in the ""honey moon"" period kinda thing. 

But yeah, everything's fine now. To be honest it was always fine, this was just a minor thing that some how got blown out of proportion. I barely remember but I think we were both just stressed with work that day so we ended up getting into a silly fight. 

Seriously I love my wife so hopefully no judgement by you guys on the one comment she said back then. She's honestly a really good person!

I made an update thread a few weeks back but was a few days early for the minimum and someone commented on the old thread a few days ago so I remembered to repost the update thread today with a few more updates.

Thanks everyone :)

I'm a bitch to my husband when he wakes me up,"My husband and I have been married for 5 years. We have three boys, ages 4, 2, and 6 months. It's no secret that I am cranky when I am tired, and especially when I'm awakened from sleeping. We joke about it a lot, but this morning he was really upset with me...

Last night, I went to bed at 10. He stayed up, which was fine. He even took the baby downstairs with him so I could get some better quality rest. All good. 

Just after midnight, he came to bed with the baby. (Baby sleeps in our room.) I don't remember any of this, but He says he put the baby down and went to brush his teeth. Baby started crying. I got out of bed, flung open the bathroom door, said ""get this baby out of here, you woke me up!"" And went back to sleep. 

This morning I woke up at 630 when our second son woke up. I noticed my husband was not in bed, and our baby was not in the room, either. Feeling very well rested, I told my husband I felt great, and asked if he slept downstairs. He said yes. I asked why, and he told me I yelled at him and he didn't want to deal with it. 

I remembered none of this. Once he told me the details, I have a vague recollection of what happened. 

I feel really guilty about this.  Simply telling myself to be more conscientious doesn't seem to be working. How do I change this behavior?

TIFU by ordering food online amd essentially setting restaurant on fire with the help of bee movie script,"Ok guys, gonna make it short. This happened like a year ago, but i just remembered it and wanned to share  


It was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. Found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  
So i got an idea, to ""prank"" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. Thats where the FU happened. Few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (it wasnt that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). Well shortly after, also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction. (ps: was on ground floor, ""wall"" was from glass, so you could easily se on the street)  
The next day i read in local newspapers, that the exact restaurant caught fire because of some cash register malfunction

[UPDATE] My GF likes me to go by different names.,"TL;DR: Most of you were right, she was sleeping with Matt.


Here is  a link to the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9x4b5s/my_gf_likes_me_to_go_by_different_names/


I want to start off by saying thank you to everyone who responded. 

After I made my post, I waited 2 days to say anything to her because I wanted to get as much input as possible. I also took that time to prepare myself to separate.

I started reading comments right after I posted. I replied to a few but after so many telling me that she was cheating on me with me, I started to feel sick. I called my boss to ask for Friday off for personal reasons. I spent the day driving around, looking for potential apartments. We don't live together but I wanted to make sure if things went bad, she'd have a harder time finding me. We also have some good memories in that apartment and I think I would be sad if I had to continue to live there. 

This brings us to Saturday, the day I promised myself I would say something. I invited her over for breakfast but instantly regretted it because I was getting so nervous that I completely lost my appetite. She walked in the door and instantly knew something was different. I was hoping to ease into it, but I ended up blurting out, ""I met Matt Blank"". She tried to act casual about it, but I could tell she didn't expect me to know about him. For the next 3 or so minuted things were calm, I talked about how I see the past 4 months completely differently. She started to cry and say she was sorry, I don't mean some tears but full on ugly crying. I told her I'm going to work on forgiving her, because if I don't I think it will eat me up inside. I won't forget what happened but I'll at least try to move on. She started to talk about how she'll work on building my trust again. I interrupted her by saying that that isn't necessary, as we were no longer together. 

If I wasn't so emotionally crushed, I would have been amazed at the transition. She started begging me to give her another chance. I stood up and went to my room to grab a few boxes of all the gifts she gave me. I told her that I had already made up my mind to break up with her. After some back and forth, she realized that I was serious. I knew the exact moment she knew I was serious because she went from crying to yelling. It started off with insults and when that didn't work she tried throwing the truth in my face to hurt me. It started off that I was fat, ugly, lazy, stupid, and I had a useless job. In the middle of her tirade, she said Matt's dick was way bigger than mine.

As she was yelling at me, she ended up saying what happened between the two of them. I'll summarize below:

She started sleeping with Matt 3 years ago, they were on some sort of work trip and ended up drunkenly sleeping together. From there it went from once in a while to once a week. Matt called things off 4 months ago because he met a girl. I think she was using the vacations because she missed being with Matt. 

I don't really remember the rest of Saturday. I spent Sunday with my friends which helped, I told them what happened which was nice to get off my chest. I went to work as normal yesterday, at some point in the day she slipped a note under my door. I'm not sure what it said because I burned it. ",relationship_advice

TIFU by showing my friend nude pictures of his sister,"This happened almost 4 years ago, but today it made me think about it.

Backstory, I met this amazing girl at a party that some friends of mine were throwing.  It was a themed party, prep boy and school girls, and she was as kind as she was sexy.  We exchange numbers and proceed to texting and talking on the phone and went out on a few dates.

Well, just like most relationships, I assume, she sent me a few sexy pictures of herself.  Well one day, my buddy asks me about the girl I am dating.  I tell him about her and he asks about her body.  I show him a picture she took of herself laying out by the pool, neck down.  He grabs my phone and starts swiping.  Before I can stop him he freaks out yelling ""that is my fucking sister!!!"" I then realize the picture he was looking at was one I took of her fully nude.  After that, he was not too happy about it, or me dating his sister.

But this story has a happy ending.  The reason I am posting this today, is because this is the one year anniversary of the day I married that wonderful woman, and that buddy was one of my groomsman.

And before anyone asks, no, she has no clue her brother saw a picture of her nude, I think she would be mortified if she did.

Tl;dr: Was dating a girl who turned out to be my buddy's sister, showed him a nude photo of her and he freaked out.

Edit: since people are freaking out thinking I showed a nude picture on purpose let me clarify.  I showed my friend a picture of her in a bikini neck down that she took laying out by a pool.  She posted said picture on Instagram as well as sent it to me.  I did not willingly violate her trust by showing him a nude picture of her.  Apologies if my wording was off.

Edit 2: Thank you for the gold and silver, you guys are awesome!  Also, since everyone asks how I didn't know she was my buddy's sister.  She and him have a common last name like Smith.  And I did not know his sisters name.  When I told him I was dating a girl named ""Jill"" (not her name) he didn't immediately think ""oh hey is that my sister."" Because it is a common name.  And as for my wife, we had been dating for a little over a month.  When she said she had a brother, I didn't go ""oh what's his name, where does he work, what's his astrological sign.""  Because I wanted to know her first, know her likes and hobbies.  I guess I could have dove more into questions about her family, but we weren't at the point of meeting each other's parents yet.  Hope this helps with those questions, if it does not. Sorry.  Again thank you for all the kind words and happy anniversary comments.  You people are amazing!",tifu
My (28F) boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) are going on a week-long vacation. They uninvited me.,"My boyfriend wanted to go on a vacation this summer to his mom's friends' house in Hawaii with me and his two best friends (25M and 29F). We had been planning on this all spring, and at some point, 25M dropped out of the trip, leaving just the three of us.

For context, my boyfriend and I have been going out since November, and it's been serious. We had (and still have) been talking about moving in together and he has said, and I agree, that this is a long-term situation and that we are in it for good.

In early June, once 25M unexpectedly dropped out of the trip, 29F called my boyfriend and told him that now that it was just the three of us, she didn't feel comfortable with me going on the trip, since she didn't know me that well and she didn't want to be a third wheel. She said that if I were to go, she wouldn't go on the trip. Without telling me that this was happening, they changed the plans and made it a trip just the two of them and they changed the location to a beach in Costa Rica.

I was trying to figure out when to ask for time off this summer and hadn't heard news about the plans, so I asked my boyfriend which week in August I should be setting aside for the Hawaii trip. He let me know that, actually, he had talked to his friend and that she didn't want to go if I were going, so he was going to go alone with her to Costa Rica. He said that we could go another week later maybe to Mexico City or something.

I was upset, and tried to talk with him about how the situation made me feel, especially since this wasn't a case of a separate trip being set up ahead of time -- this was a case of me being invited and then uninvited from a week-long tropical vacation with a girl friend of his who I had never met before. We eventually decided to do a trip together to Copenhagen, which we have both wanted to visit, as some sort of compensation. I also asked to meet her, so that I could feel more comfortable with the trip.

We spent the 4th of July going to see her and her boyfriend in the city where they live, and although it was nice to put a face to a name, it was ultimately a very cold trip and she was not at all welcoming to me. My boyfriend remarked on how unfriendly she was -- to both of us, he thought -- and said that he was surprised that she didn't act warmly to me. I went out of my way to try get to know her and her boyfriend (I'm very outgoing and friendly and usually this would be easy), but it didn't really click, even after several days. They were somewhat cold to each other as well -- they bickered a little bit about their future and his own 3 week trip without her that was scheduled for the same time as their trip (this had been scheduled before ours had).

This had been my effort to feel better about the trip, so I told my boyfriend that I still didn't feel comfortable with things, and that I was feeling insulted by the way that it was handled. I had tried to make things smooth between all of us, and I asked him to please come up with something that could help me feel better about the trip.

On a visit to his family, they asked about the trip and they were all shocked that he would have arranged it this way, and let me know that they would have been furious if they were in my position, which triggered a fight in which I asked him to please help come up with a strategy to make me feel better and more secure about them going together without me. He said that he would never do this kind of thing again, which feels like not much to offer, since this is kind of a once in a lifetime trip to begin with. He kind of offered to not go on the trip, but he had already paid for the tickets and made arrangements and I didn't want to stop their trip and be resented by both him and his best friend.

He asked me to give him ideas of how to make me feel better and wanted me to just tell him what to do and stalled and stalled until it was finally the day of the trip. He bought me a bag of peanut butter cups and I drove the two of them to the airport.

I feel so disregarded and disrespected in this situation. I want to break up with him, but I don't want to burn up something that has otherwise been really good.

TL;DR - I (28F) was uninvited from a vacation with my boyfriend (29M) and his best friend (29F) and I can't get over it. I want advice on how to talk with him about this.

Trevor Noah isn't funny.,"TDS used to be my all-time favorite show, and Jon Stewart is someone I idolized as a writer, comic and activist. It was a shame when he retired but it was time for that awesome torch to be passed. Trevor Noah was announced and I didn't know much about him but thought it would be cool to get a change of scenery and a fresh perspective.

I remember he got in trouble because of some offensive tweets about jewish people. Not only were the tweets completely unwarranted, they weren't even funny. He was trying to make a jew joke and it straight up and down wasn't even funny. So I watched his Netflix special at the time. Not only was it not funny, it was one of the more worse standup specials on Netflix, and I've seen almost all of them.

So I watched him on the Daily Show for months, thinking he'll eventually get into a groove and a good zone to start unleashing that high-octane wit that was associated with the program. I GENUINELY, SINCERELY, from the bottom of my heart tried to get into him, for so long, and that same lame-ass, tired, run-into-the-ground racial observations, penis jokes and impersonations of different accents that was the bread and butter for his standup didn't change. At least the Daily show was good at calling out media bullshit, but now under Trevor it has just become a mouthpiece for the media bullshit that Jon worked so passionately to combat.

**TL;DR**: I know that humor is subjective, but from my earnest and sincere perspective, gained by watching hours of the show, and all of his Netflix specials, my opinion has only solidified that not only is he not a funny/good comedian, but he is one of the worst out there, along with Jeff Dunham, Gabriel Iglesias, and... fuck it, Ricky Gervais.",unpopularopinion

(FL) A woman tried to grab my son and kicked me so I slapped her. Now a lawyer is sending me demand letters.,"I had my son in a back carrier, he's 15 months old. I was in the produce section when I feel someone trying to pick him up out of the carrier. 

I swing around and the woman is standing ther. I ask her what the fuck she thinks she's doing, she said that she's just trying to hold him. I told no and fuck off. At this point she kicks me very hard in the leg, so I slapped her as hard as I could and she fell to the ground.

Luckily there were witness who called the police and stuck around when they arrived. The woman was arrested for battery. The police said that I shouldn't worry since I acted in defense of myself and my son, they also made a note that she attempted to take him out of his carrier.

Yesterday I received a letter from a lawyer. The woman wants $10,000 for ""damages"" and ""discrimination"" or they will ruin my name and career.

Isn't that extortion? Should I just take the letter down to the station and let them deal with it or do I need a lawyer?",legaladvice

"Boston, my therapist has created a false rape and forced abortion and is reporting it on my behalf, I was not raped.","I am in Boston BUT my abortion happened in New York City. I was 18 and this was completely legal. 

I'm 18 and in college. Like all 18 year olds, I mess up. I messed up big time and I ended up pregnant. I waited a week after my pregnancy test came up positive, I went to the doctor to 100% confirm the pregnancy, and my best friend, her boyfriend, my boyfriend, and I took a couples' trip to NYC so I could have the abortion in a safe environment and have everything taken care of in a timely manner. 

We got back to Boston and life went on. I am in therapy to work through my problems regarding the suicide attempts of my older sister and dealing with the repercussions of her mental illness. I have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses, I'm not considered depressed, I have no history of any kind of any mental illnesses, self harm, or anything of the sort. I receive my therapy in a non religious environment. This is just straight up confidential counseling because my sister attempted suicide right before I went to college, my parents are toxic, and I needed help with that burden. 

I told my therapist immediately that I'd had an abortion, told her my reasons (cost of a baby, not wanting children, I go to a university that I worked my ass off to get into and I'll be damned if I let an unwanted pregnancy ruin my life. I also could not raise a child that I disdained. Selfish? Yes. But I'm not sorry). I also informed her that my boyfriend and I are still together and that he and I plan on staying together, the sex was between two adults who 100% consented, it was just a mixup and confusion on both of our parts. He and I split the cost of the abortion with him paying 75% of the cost. 

I go home and do homework. At around 4 pm, I get a visit from the Boston Police who are investigating a rape. They think that I'm the victim and my boyfriend is the perpetrator and that I've been forced to have an abortion, I ask them where they got this false information and give them proof that both he and I agreed that abortion was the way to go. After a lot of talking to smooth things over and apologizing, they left. 

Then I get a call from my parents. They're ranting on and on about how I've gotten an abortion and sinned in God's eyes, how I've been fornicating and screwed every man in NYC, and how my lack of contact (I'm NC with them because of abuse and they're narcissists) is killing my mother. They screamed down the phone for four hours before telling me that they've been given my address in Boston by my therapist and are coming to get me no matter what. 

It becomes clear. My therapist called the police, reported a false rape and forced abortion, violated all sorts of confidentiality, and had to track my parents down (I never gave her their number, address, or personal information. She did not know their names, I only ever called them mom and dad) to call them to say that I'd been raped and gotten an abortion. 

I never gave her any sort of go ahead to do anything. I never used the word rape in our sessions, in fact, when I mentioned the sex, I called it ""consensual sex"". The police are still hounding me, I'm freaking out and constantly having panic attacks, my therapist is making things worse by CONTINUING to knowingly provide false information to the police (although I gave them the information that should have ended this all), therapist is also saying that I have Stockholm Syndrome and that's why I won't report my boyfriend, and I'm at a loss for what to do. 

I also know why she's having some weird witch hunt. My boyfriend is in a fraternity and in her mind, I was brutally raped at a fraternity party (this is what she told the police). I was not and in the session I said specifically told her that I never had sex with him at his fraternity house several times when she tried to convince me that I was raped at his fraternity house. 

I've also started to get calls from the NYPD investigating the ""forced abortion"" and I'm freaking out and don't know what to do. This is serious. 

At this point in time I know that I need to get the police off my butt. Is there a way that would help me? Is a lawyer the best way to go? Also, is there a way for me to report my therapist and make sure that she is punished? Is there a way to make sure she doesn't do this again? 


Edit: when the cops came the first time, I told them that she was completely falsifying everything and I gave them evidence. She is continuing to call and labeling me with various mental illnesses so she gets her point across and so I'm not taken seriously. The last time the cops called was last night. ",legaladvice

(UPDATE):My MIL exposed my (28f) past group-assault to my husband (34m). Who had no idea. Wants him to divorce me. Please help me.,"Tldr: MIL told my Husband and their family about my assault after stealing my journal where I wrote about it in detail and how it caused my infertility. Hubby and I are solid. She then texted everyone pictures of the things written in my journal and said she was doing the Christian thing. 

Hi guys, I just wanted to give you a quick update about a post I made 5 days ago on here. You were very kind to me. Thank you. It got locked and deleted because I had the wrong username so I've just made another account and added the ""throwRA"" to my normal username LullabelleAnabelle, so I can make a quick update for this subreddit. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to link to my post because I posted it on another subreddit too. A lot of you suggested I go to the mother in law subreddit which was also a big help. Thank you everyone. You're wonderful. 

To clear a few things you enquired about and to just speak about my wonderful partner a little more (if I may). I'm not American, European born and raised, but my husband is and we live here. We met at his friend's wedding where I did the bride's makeup (I'm a wedding mua), and he drunkenly told me during the reception that she looked a bit like a chucky doll (she didn't, and he still doesn't know or care what blusher is). We had some serious words, mostly where I told him to stfu, and then he invited me to dinner as a way of apologising for being an ass and I fell hard. And you guys are so right, he is the best person I have ever met. He's a serious, stoic, super focused and quiet kind of guy, doesn't really speak or smile until he needs to but he's so sarcastic and funny and charming and just so sweet and kind. And he says that he really enjoys my giddy chatterbox. So I think I'll need to hold onto him because that type of patience is rare. He's just my world. 

It hasn't been easy. A few things have happened and I can't honestly say that I'm better off for it. But I'm trying.  Again, really not a troll post. I'm not creative enough to write something that fantastical. This is all true and a little bit long so im sorry for that. 

I didn't know how to tell him. Or what I wanted to tell him. A bunch of you said to show him this page or my diary but those were my private thoughts, I didn't want to show him ever. So, I told him I could show him the details of the court transcripts and my medical records. They aren't particularly easy to read. Those men weren't very nice to me. They had found me walking through a park near my house in the evening and grabbed me and pulled me behind one of the paths where a lot of trees and bushes were. And they had gone to jail. 

He got really upset and told me that he didn't care what any of those pieces of paper said, he knew instantly that his mother was lying and just spewing bullshit. That I didn't have to work up the courage to tell him anything about my past if I didn't want to, he'd never thought for a second I was ever hiding anything from him that would ruin our relationship. He'd always known there was something because of the way my anxiety would come out and my nightmares and struggles during intimacy at times, but he would never have pushed the issue. He wanted me to feel safe with him and he trusted me completely. He said he was so scared that I would leave, especially after offering him a divorce. And he was keeping his family away from me because he didn't want them to stress me out any further. They were just confused and concerned and trying to reach out to us. Nothing malicious or accusing. 

I thought it was going to all be okay eventually but unfortunately, 3 nights ago, she sent him a text with some pictures of some parts of my journal. She'd taken pictures of the parts where I described things that had happened almost too vividly and then I had pointed out ways I could have defended myself and questioned why I hadn't fought back, before explaining it away as being my fault, blaming it on the way my body had developed and the way I looked and wanting them to do those things to me. Its a disgusting, jumbled piece of my mental state at the time. It was stupid but it was just a way back then to pull all my negative thoughts out of my head and get rid of them so I didn't have to think about the ways I could have stopped it. Maybe it was the wrong way to do it but it's all I had, I never went to therapy. She put in her message that I had spread my legs and got her son to believe my sob story but she had proof I was a willing whore and she would never let her children and grandchildren be alienated from her. 

His sister rang him crying and told him that their mom had sent her the same text. And to the other siblings and some others in the family. Fil was apparently furious and the family have reached out multiple times to my poor husband to apologise and ask after me. 

Things haven't been going well. My husband is so broken over his mother's actions and is just lashing out. He's broken all ties with her and is just so furious at anyone in the family who even reaches out to ask if we're doing okay. He won't let them get in contact with me and is just so angry. He owns the house my in-laws live in and financially supports them 100% and has told them that they'll need to get out immediately and he's done financing their shit. But I'm trying to get him to not do that. It's just a house and some money, it doesn't matter. I don't know how to comfort him or what to say or do to reassure him that he is not to blame for what she's done. 

As for me, I'm just in a fog. I don't know how to process what she did, so I'm not going to until I'm ready. My husband isn't leaving me alone and it helps to just cuddle up and pretend nothing has happened for a little bit. I think we might start some couples therapy, just to be able to learn ways to help each other through this and become closer and communicate better. I'm not ready for any therapy regarding my own stuff yet. It sickens me that they know this about me, that they know a chunk of what my feelings and thoughts were back then. I hate it so much that my husband read those parts and he knows I thought like that about myself. I never wanted to be some damaged victim in front of him. Its just shit. 

I won't be posting on here again. 
Thank you all for your lovely words. I hope you take care.

Edit: thank you all so much for being so kind and wonderful. And thank you to the commenters who privately messaged me telling me how much I must have enjoyed and asked for it and offering to reenact it with me again. No.",relationship_advice

TIFU by being accidentally racist,"So this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.



Recently Ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so I thought I'd go along. 

So anyway here I am about to play my first game of chess ever. I sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (I should now mention my opponent was African American). The chess teacher says ""first rule of chess, whites go first."" 

I think to myself wow that's pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. 

So I grab a pawn and slide it forward, then I look up expecting my opponent to make his move. Instead I'm met with a look of confusion and horror, I begin to hear laughter from the people watching. 

I then realize my error ""oooh you meant the pieces"" I murmur. 
The teacher nods. 

Now everyone thinks I'm a massive racist.

So when all this went down, my sister and I asked my mom to take a DNA test as well. She agreed. As it turns out, my mom is not my biological mom. As I said before, it makes no difference to me because my mom is my mom no matter what.

My mom was wholeheartedly under the impression her eggs were used in her IVF treatment. She is contacting her doctor who is still in practice to figure out what the hell this means. 

I'm actually sort of sad for my mom, I didn't consider this as an option in the realm of possibility. We are her daughters of course but I can't imagine finding out at her age with adult kids that your biological line actually ends with you. 

So yeah, guess that's all I have for now!

Thanks everyone for your support. I actually bumped into my ex-girlfriend at the birthday party of a friend a few days ago. I didn't know she'd be there. She said hi to me like nothing was the matter. Like we hadn't spent 2 years of our lives together. She looked great and I wish I hadn't gone to the party. I was healing in my own time, just going to work and focusing on friends and family. But seeing her again was like opening an old wound.

After the party, she unblocked me and sent me a very long text. She said she was sorry for how she acted, that she just woke up one day when I was gone and realized that she didn't want to be with me. Just like that. She said being in a relationship just exhausts her (she's an introvert). She said she likes being by herself, without any drama or tears or stress. 

I said that's fine, but she could have at least told me. She apologized to me again and said she was being a coward. She said she hates breaking up with people and said she was waiting for me to break up with her first.

I just think she got tired of me and didn't even care enough about me to end it properly. So she just decided pretending I didn't exist was the best way to do it. 

I can't say hearing all this helps. I don't really even have much closure. But people wanted me to update and so I did.

"If it's socially acceptable for women to put ""Sorry, no short men"" as a requirement in online dating profiles, then it should also be acceptable for men to say ""Sorry, no flat-chested women"", or ""no overweight women"" in theirs.","I understand that a women may only want a guy of a certain height for whatever reason they may have. That's fine. You are attracted to who you are attracted to and there is nothing wrong with that. 

Maybe she just wants to warn a guy before wasting their time with meeting up somewhere, or stop them from getting their hopes up. I get that too. 

However, if a man were to say  ""Sorry, no (blank)  women"", they would get accused of body shaming and everyone would lose their shit. 

It's a double standard, and its absolute bullshit. Whereas someone would say of the woman ""Oh, she's just very selective and knows what she wants"", they would say of the man ""What a pig!

TIFU by not closing the tab of porn on my phone after masturbating.,"Here we go. This happened yesterday in university. 

So, I wake up at 7 and I have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.

I brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. As I am drying myself I pick up the phone to check time and it's only 7:20 yet and I have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and I haven't had a good release since a week. 

I take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching PornHub. I take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. I am all into it and realise I have only 5 more minutes left. I give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. 

I reach university and the examination hall is already full. Here (India) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your Exam Registration. I take my stuff and enter the classroom. 

The invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. I go to my desk and as I am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. I lose my shit and get all tensed up. 

I try to keep calm and switch it to Silent Mode and tell myself if I act normally I won't get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. 

Soon after the Unfair Means Squad (They check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. I keep my head down and act like I have nothing. 

One of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. I start sweating and I almost shit my pants. She tells me to empty my pockets and I take everything out and put it on the desk.

 She stares at me and picks up my phone. 

""You seem like a studious one. Why are you cheating?"" She said. 

""I am not. It's an honest mistake."" 

Then she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if I have any PDF or Browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she'll let me go. 

My heart finally stops powering a jet and I place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. 

My heart now starts powering a rocket as I recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. The video paused.  There's nothing on the screen though. No image or thumbnail. 

""Cheating from a video?"" She says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. 

There it is. Dani Daniels and Manuel Ferrara going at it. The sound of Dani Daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. 

The professor dropped my phone and had a face as if I was masturbating in front of her. 

Now I have failed Computational Mathematics and have to give a written apology to the Dean of Academics and Convenor of Examination. 

Anyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. Had to send the link. 


TL;DR : I forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. Accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn't allowed and thr professor caught me. She checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.

Edit : 

1. For the people who think this is fake. It is not.   
                                                         
2.  For people who are saying why was I failed and now need to produce an apology one even though I wasn't cheating - It is because in India these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. Also, I only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. 

3. The porn was Manuel Ferrara and Dani Daniels, they don't have much together. You will easily get it with one search on PornHub. If I may suggest something much more better, please try Manuel Ferrara and The Goddess Remy LaCroix. The video starts with them talking about cup or something. That also is easily available. 

4. About the girl who asked for the link. 

I was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. 

The girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. As she came outside she asked me why did I bring a phone to the exam and even if I did, I could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. I said I could have but my I couldn't think at that time and was afraid. 

After that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. The girl accompanied me to the admin office. I accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. 

It was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. She asked to show me what was the video while giggling and I thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. She started laughing and told me I am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. Then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. She remembered my name and my Department. Then we parted ways. 

For fuck's sake, she is cute. Stop telling me to pursue her. I have another exam later. Maybe will meet her there. 


The Indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.

Edit 2: Man I have been reading the comments and you bastards are funny as fuck. I have bee quite depressed since a few weeks and this cheered me up good. 

Thanks for whoever sent the silver and gold. I haven't figured out what to do with them anyway.

Edit 3: Invigilator is an actual word people and we use it all the time. In fact, that is the word for Exam Proctor here in India borrowed down from the time when we had a case of Britishers.

The only reason I posted this was because my old man called me up and said he spoke to his friend who is a really smart 22yr Veteran of the Military. (So is my pops) about my situation. The friend mentioned to my old man that it sounded like ""discrimination"" and I should see a lawyer.

I signed the offer of employment and when they did the 2nd background check I received a call from the temp agency saying they were no longer going to hire me citing my record. Even though I was upfront with my record.

Do I have any kind of legs here? Or is this just what I should expect until I can get my record expunged? 

Kinda shitty man. This job was the best thing that happened to me... I was able to help my mom out and feel like a normal person of society. Idk. I don't want any boo hoo's for me. I know I'm a good person.

I felt wronged in this situation, dirty almost. I understand if I provided  them with reasons like being late, or not performing. But I knew I had something to prove and I did just that. Which is why they offered me the position.

I was in that warehouse for 3 months... There background check went back 7 years....

This really set me back financially and honestly my manhood was defeated a bit, but that's life.


Is there anything here for me to pursue? 

Thanks to anyone that can help. Have lovely day everyone!

My parents are cock-blocking me,"Bit of a backstory: my SO and I have been together 11 years, married for 1.5 years. We've had a normal sex life with ups and downs, are always open communication wise about sex and our wants/needs. It's always been a healthy relationship that we consciously work on. 

3 months ago, my dad was diagnosed with cancer, and asked us to move back home to help out with the day to day and have also been helping financially. We both have low earning professions, and have been doing our best to be helpful. Most days, we are pretty tired by the end of the night, once everything is done and my parents are asleep. My mom has also made a comment about how she expects us to find another place to have sex. She has suggested getting hotel rooms or having sex in my car. We don't make enough to pay for hotel stays, and it's illegal to do it in a car where I'm from. To top it off my husband has said he doesn't feel comfortable in my parents home.  We've had sex once since moving in a month and a half ago. And it wasn't good sex. It was awkward. 
I know that sex isn't everything in a relationship, but as I've said to my husband, I feel like I have become more of a best friend than a wife. I'm not really sure what to do to make my husband feel more comfortable, or where to have sex without running the risk of getting arrested.


EDIT: thanks for the feedback, I was asked about my cultural background, I'm from a middle eastern family, where respecting your parents is kinda huge. 
Also we weren't 10 when we met, I'm 32 now. 
Does anyone have any tips on shower sex? Even though my bod is wet, there's no lubrication down there so it never works out. I also have the squeakiest bed which accounted for a lot of the awkwardness. And pumping music and tv will wake my father up(remember he has cancer and needs to rest)
Moving out is a great idea but rent in our city is ridiculous and would take months to save for since I'm giving my parents a lot of our income. I'm also trying to save for school so I can have a better lot in life. After all that I'm basically broke, so even air b&b is difficult.",relationship_advice

AITA for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?,"So my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. She was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. She was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

I tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. He said no. And my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. I spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. Which is fair enough. 

He said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. My son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

Last week, he told us she's dumped him. I went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. Me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

I confessed to them both that I actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. He did not treat her properly and I hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. I said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

Wife and son are very upset that I said this. Very very upset and my wife says I am being horrible.

My wife (29F) is encouraging me (31M) to have an affair?,"Wife and I have been married for 5 years. I think we have a good relationship and a great sex life. I think she thought the same. However, following a 5-day yoga retreat with a few of her work friends while I was at a conference late last year her opinion seems to have soured.

Apparently ""Fernando and Sarah"" have everything we have, and more, because... they're swingers! When he has sex with another woman he uses it as a learning experience to take home to his doting wife (who also bones around) and they have even more mind-blowing drug-fuelled experiences with each other while the kids are staying with grandma... or atleast that's what I'm getting from it.

So I told her flatly that I don't want to have sex with anyone else and am happy with her; and she quickly states the feeling is mutual. Case closed I thought, but then she comes back with more reasons the next week ""it gives independece and freedom to the relationship.""

I'm thinking maybe this is a bit of a mid-life crisis thing and made it clear I'm just not really into banging other people because it feels too much like cheating, but she's insistent! She keeps going on and on about her work friend Fernando talking about how mindblowing the experience has been for him and how we really need to try it.

SO at this point I'm thinking: are you wanting to cheat on me? She's entirely focussed on me going out and having sex with someone else, but I'm sitting here thinking ""what's in it for her?"" It's concerning.

Straw that broke the camel's back is today she came home with a picture of ""Fernando's Sarah"" and a hint that she's down to hook up with me at their place... I'm like... lost for words right now. How do I make it clear I don't want to ahve sex with someone else and I believe in monogamous relationships.

UPDATE TO: I found out I have a daughter who thinks I was her mother's rapist. It wasn't rape. What next?,"Ten days ago I requested advice and the post got removed after a day because I didn't use a ThrowRA.  I'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. I alerted the moderators I would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

ORIGINAL

I received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a DNA match and she is my biological daughter. It was a long and emotionally charged letter. She said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish I had caused her and her mother and grandparents. The letter was gut wrenching.

I was shocked but also skeptical. I have been married 25 years and I have three great kids. I have never raped or abused a woman ever! I thought this had to be a prank or scam. I had done home DNA ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child I wasn't aware of. But when I logged into my account, there she was.

I did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, Terry (fake name), I had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  We broke it off mutually and remained friendly. The very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. It was a casual hookup and I remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. Also unprotected. Afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. We both went home the next morning for summer break. Terry didn't come back to college the next year, which I gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

One of the reasons Terry and I were incompatible was religion. She was Catholic and I'm Jewish. I was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. My supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a Jewish ex-boyfriend. But who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

It kills me that I have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. I can't imagine growing up thinking I was a product of rape. That has to be so hard psychologically. I am in pain for a child I didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

I have been debating what to do. I have not written back to my daughter. I badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). My wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. My best friend says I should hire a lawyer. I don't know what to do and it's eating me up. Advice, please!

UPDATE

I hired a lawyer. He recommended that I respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. I wrote her a short message and described how and when Terry and I met. I was careful not to attack Terry and to offer sympathy. I explained that our sex was consensual. A week went by with no response.

Two days ago my daughter wrote me and said Terry now claims she was raped a month after she and I had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. She's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. I find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not I guess it gives Terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

Yesterday I spoke to my daughter for the first time. She was crying and so was I, so it wasn't easy to say much. Before we hung up, I told her that I loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and I hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. She sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

My wife and I told our kids about a week ago. They are teenagers and took it really well. All three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. My wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. She has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the Christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. My daughter is going to call me again tonight and I'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. We have a lifetime of catching up to do.

Meantime as for Terry, I feel like my daughter and I were robbed, but I really don't want to dwell on it. She hasn't reached out to me and I don't plan to either, though I'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.

TIFU by letting my kid lay in my lap NSFW,"This happened last night. My wife and I were settling down for the evening and sat down on the couch to watch TV while our 13-month old played on the floor. After a short time he apparently decided he wanted to cuddle up on the couch with us. He climbed up on the couch and crept up close to me with a smile and the lates his head down flat on my thigh. It was close to his bed time so I didn't give it a second thought.

We were both really into the show we were watching when suddenly I felt a sharp pain on the top of my penis. I mean like a turtle had just reached out and latched on. I screamed in pain at first and looked down to realize my son had shifted his head slightly against the shorts I was wearing, and just chomped down. He may still be a baby but he has some sharp ass teeth.

I grabbed him to get him off and my wife didn't understand what was happening. She thought I was just randomly in pain and trying to throw our son. It looked like that, well, because he wouldn't freaking let go. I finally tugged him away and to the floor and he screamed crying as my wife went to console him and I got up and cupped a hand to my crotch and paced back and forth with a feeling I'd never felt before.

I walked outside to get away from the crying for a moment and stinging pain wasn't stopping. After a few moments I returned inside and looked inside my pants to survey the damage. My penis was bleeding from the tip. He left a freaking indention with his teeth. Still hurts today every time anything brushes against it. I'll be way more cautious going forward about where he's laying his head. My wife later laughed and called him amazing birth control.

TL;DR Let my kid lay on my lap and found out how sharp his teeth are. Now I've got a cut and sore penis.",tifu

The current lack of human natural selection is detrimental to progress,"Right now, there are 7.7 billion humans sharing Earth. This population is unsustainable considering the average intelligence of a human. The standard where we are now required to keep everyone alive and with basic necessities goes against the fundamental principle of how life has always worked. Why are we letting low IQ people who are addicted to drugs and on food stamps reproduce? A couple of hundred years ago, and these people are systematically taken care of by nature. Now the burden is on everyone else to take care of a growing class of idiots who will never contribute to society. Not only are they not producing, but hinder the progress of the brightest because their hard work is being sapped by the bottom 50%. No other species does this, humans are a special and remarkable species but to ignore the rules of nature has proven to be foolish. Other animals love their offspring as well, but they also understand that if their kid is too weak to independently survive, keeping him/her alive will cause their entire species to eventually go extinct. The short term value of not naturally selecting a better human population is just asking for the entire population to collapse, which will probably happen in the next couple hundred of years at this point considering how greedy humans are.

[Serious] Just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.,"A few days ago I was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

I decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until I decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

Here's the joke I told:

""What do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

Throw your washing (laundry if you're American) in.""

One of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. When I asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

Obviously I felt mortified as I didn't know about it, and said ""I'm so sorry to hear that. Did he drown?""

""No,"" replied the guy. ""He choked on a sock.""",Jokes

TIFU by shaving my butthole before a first date.,"Edit1: Technically ""trimmed"" not ""shaved""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So the TIFU happened last night, but this requires some background explanation...

This is gonna be TMI, but that's kinda the nature of TIFU, so whatever. I'm a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. I also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. Sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and I don't know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (AKA the Taco Bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it AIN'T FUN. So I had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. Less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. So I trimmed it off at night, added some Aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. Win-win!

Fast forward two days, and I'm going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. Classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she's like the best looking girl I've dated, so I wanna shell out the monies of course. Dinner went pretty well, and we got Coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren't home) for a movie. Turns out they aren't home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.

But, guys, I can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  We're sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and I just had to let one out. I'm usually pretty good at silent farts, so I'm not paying attention to the fact that we're in a quiet spot in the movie. And this fart was NOT SILENT! It was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart I've ever had in my entire life, hands down. I was mortified. She immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and I of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. She did not laugh with me...No text-backs so far.

I googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. So a little TIL there for you inside this TIFU. Just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so I can go on dates again.

&#x200B;

Edit2: Man I shouldve used my real account for the awards! Guess I'll have to switch over to this baby.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - I shaved my butthole to make wiping easier and prevent rashes. Turns out it makes your farts super loud, which I discovered during a movie in my apartment on a date, which ended awkwardly and soon after.",tifu

UPDATE: I (48 M) don't know how to be a dad to a child (1 year M) I never wanted.,"While it's only been a few days since I posted I think I've been able to find myself in a better place, mentally speaking. I've done a vast amount of thinking and introspection. I had a lot to process. A lot to figure out. I believe I was in a bit of a panic when I posted. I feel calmer now since reading each and every comment.

I know now more than ever that I was never meant to be a dad. I certainly never wanted to be dad. Yet here I am, a dad. That will never change. My son is here and he needs me more than I need the life I'd originally planned for myself. He needs me.

Admittedly I've been a very hands off father. Not truly involved nor invested. If anything I was peeking through the window of fatherhood. Or better put, having one foot in the door and the other out. Neither here nor there. Mostly watching from afar.

I think my fear of him and what he represented in my mind drove me away from him. It made me avoid him so I could avoid the overwhelming feeling of ""what have I done"" and ""my life is over."" I think avoidance made things fester, made my fear and dread grow, and that painted a dark cloud over everything.

Still, I feel heavy weight of loathing for the future and I mourn for the life I wanted, even if it is selfish. I realize these feelings they need to go. I need to move on. Grieve in a sense and push forward and forget how things could have been. They simply are not and will never be.

I sent my wife away yesterday so I could spend the day with my son. My first day alone with him. Maybe that's pathetic. Maybe I'm a terrible man. Maybe I'm a terrible husband. Definitely an awful dad.

I wanted to experience him in a way I hadn't before. Alone without being able to hand him over when he frustrated me or I was bored. 

Honestly the day went shit. We both had a tough time. He wanted mom and so did I. There was this moment though when I sang to him ""I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas"" and he laughed so damn hard. I've never made him laugh like that before. It wasn't miraculous or revolutionary but I did feel this little spark inside me. This little ""I want to do that again"" sort of feeling.

I've done what a lot of you have told me and I've reached out to a few therapists. I have an appointment for next week and currently waiting to hear back from two others. I want to shop around and find a good fit since I know I need this. I feel ashamed admitting such a thing. I feel embarrassed. I for some reason even feel emasculated too. 

There are also a lot of unpleasant things I feel when I look at my son. What I've utterly failed to take into account is what I see, which is the epitome of innocence. From that I learned that I need to seperate my feelings from him. Whatever negativity I feel is not his doing, that is all me and my fears surrounding him. He is not the source of my feelings. He is a trigger and I need to fix that.

My son is innocent and he needs me. This is the truth.

I'm not leaving. I've resolutely decided that I'm not leaving. I'm never leaving. I need to pack up that fantasy and put it out of my mind. My wife needs me. My son needs me more. He needs me. He needs me. He needs me. I keep telling myself this. He needs me. He needs a dad. I have to be all in because in the long run being all out seems like such a worse fate for all involved.

I want to touch on a few things before I wrap this up...

Saying I love my wife is a profound understatement. She is all my hopes and dreams rolled into a package of femininity and determination. I married her for the long haul not just until things didn't go my way. Nowhere in my vows did it say if we accidentally create a child everything we've gone through is null and void, my love will disappear and I'm out. 

Some people said she betrayed me. I've never felt betrayed. The baby wasn't planned. We even took steps to terminate but her heart said no and I respect that. I respect her and I respect her choice. She made the decision she could live with.  Unless you or your spouse has been pregnant and you've considered all your options your opinion really isn't relevant. Watching my wife go through the rollercoaster of emotions and hormones while battling with not only her desires but mine... It wasn't an easy decision for her. She didn't just suddenly decide she wanted a baby. She agonized over the decision.

The child is mine. Some called that into question. He is mine. There are personal factors that I don't want to get into, but I know without a doubt he is mine. And, yes, I have since gotten a vasectomy. I'd attempted twice in the past and was denied. They were hesitant because I was young and childless, then it was because my wife was still young and we were childless. Maybe I could have better searched for doctors but in the end we chose to go with an IUD.

As to where to go from here? Well, I'm a dad now. I have been for a year. There's no changing that. I must learn how to be a good one. My son needs me. I've ordered some parenting books for fathers. I've been researching some groups to join for fathers as well. I've also been contemplating cutting my hours at work. I typically work 10-12 hour days. I don't think that's feasible anymore.

AITA for letting my date pay for dinner?,"I [19M] asked a girl [18F] out to dinner. When it was time to pay, she said ""I got it"" and went into her purse. At that point I literally had the receipt thing in my hand. I thanked her and handed it to her. She hesitated a bit, but she paid and we went home happy (or so I thought).

So from my perspective I really can't see what I did wrong here. From asking her out until receiving the check, I intended to pay. After she offered to pay, I thanked her and allowed her to pay.

The next day I woke up to angry texts. She said I put her into an awkward position, forcing her to pay the bill. I asked what she wanted me to do differently. Apparently I should have argued/insisted that I would pay. My friends agree with her. Now I'm wondering if I should just apologize and pay her back.

AITA for expecting a guy who invites me to his house for a movie date at dinner time to offer drinks or food?,"The setup: I've known this guy for a couple years and we've worked together occasionally. We've had a couple dates before. We split the bill without any discussion or issue. 

He Snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. I say sure.

I forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point I replied ""pizza and a movie"" and he replied ""yeah see you soon!"" It was just an innocent phrase but I didn't eat that day and assumed we'd get food together.

I show up and he has the movie. I say ""so are we getting food?"" 

He says ""I already ate. But I'm sure you have apps on your phone if you want something."" Then he leaves to go to the bathroom.

I sit there awkwardly. This guy previously talked about being a men's rights guy. A normal one, not an incel dickhead. He also mentioned he's low on cash. But isn't it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? If he was too broke I'd obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn't the vibe I got since he bragged about a new game he bought. 

He returns and turns on the TV and turns off all the lights. Then he goes into the kitchen, which I assume is to get alcohol. 

I call out casually ""what do you got to drink?"" 

He calls back ""Do you like tap water?""

This is not some red pill bullshit. I know this guy, he's serious. There's nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. 

I call out, ""Yeah, sure.""

He brings me back a glass of tap water. He winks at me.

I'm starving. I haven't eaten since 8am. 

I say ""Hey, I don't wanna be weird, but I thought we were getting pizza."" 

He says in a sympathetic tone, ""Oh. I see. You must have been confused. YOU mentioned the food, not me. I should have cleared that up, I ate earlier. Sorry if that wasn't clear. We can still get a pizza if you want. Just pick anywhere nearby and order it.""

This is still kind of shitty to me, but I ignore it and order one large pizza. The pizza shows up. I eat two slices of it. The rest of it sits there the entire movie. He doesn't offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. He tries to make out with me during the movie. I stop him and feel too weird to be into it. 

After the movie, I decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. I tell him my feelings and how he's weird with money and I'm uncomfortable. He feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. There was no bad intention at all. No red pill, no plan, nothing. Just a dude who didn't think my pizza was his responsibility. 

Then he asks me to have sex with him.

I decline. Knowing we still have to work together, I manage to tiptoe out the door.

I don't expect or need people to buy me things, but I think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners. (And then they can offer to split the tab)

TIFU by scratching my neck and getting pulled over,"So there I was driving down the interstate going about 70 mph minding my own business. I feel a small tickle on the back of my neck barely above threshold. I reach back to itch the feeling and bring my hand back to the wheel. IT'S A GIANT FUCKING SPIDER! 



Worse still, that monster took a short ride on my hand and landed in my lap. I quickly slap the crap out of this thing. Well, I am not a smart man. That spider got squashed into liquified guts with my nuts on the other end. I'm not sure if anyone has ever had their nuts thunderclaped while driving but it's not conducive to maintaining your lane. The shock and vomit inducing pain cause me to jerk the wheel and at the speed I was going I proceed to do terrifying back and forth where I nearly flip my SUV. Naturally, a cop saw the whole thing and the blue lights go up.


So I keep my hands on wheel and the cop comes up to the window. ""Son, what seems to be your problem!?"" The cop had been directly behind me and I assume he nearly rear ended me. For whatever reason he wasn't happy. ""Officer, I'm not sure if you're going to believe me but take a look at my crotch real quick"" ... awkward pause... ""that didn't come out very well but that mess is what's left of the spider I powersmashed on my balls."" I leave it at that and let him connect the dots. He leans over a little to look at the spider guts. After checking to see if I had any warrants he lets me go.

TIFU by reading a reddit post and learning that I am not normal.,"So today I woke up at 5 a.m. (about an hour ago). I open reddit before I start getting ready for work. I notice a TIFU [post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) It has a lot of upvotes, so I figure it must be a good one.  

As I'm reading through the post and comments, I realize that have never been able to visualize something or someone. I only see black.  I did not realize that this is not normal. Apparently it's called aphantasia and it's relatively rare. Most people see clear images and colors when they're visualizing something. I'm 22 and did not know this was a thing until I read that post.  I've been trying to test myself for the last hour to see if I can ""picture"" anything. Turns out I can't. So now I'm sitting here having an existential crisis about all the things I'll never be able to ""see"" again.  

TL;DR I read a reddit post and discovered I have aphantasia.


EDIT: a lot of people are asking if I can dream or not.  The answer is sort of.  I do have dreams occasionally and supplements (melatonin/other sleep pills) sometimes make them more vivid, but I don't recall them at all. The only time I know I have dreamt is when it's a shocking/scary/exciting dream. I feel something after I wake up, I just can't recall a damn thing that happened. Sometimes I can remember the premise of the dream, like if it was me working or traveling somewhere, just can't ""see"" what I saw when I dreamt.  I think I dream maybe once or twice a month.

EDIT 2:  I understand the difference between visualizing and actually seeing something. *seeing* is just the best word I have to describe what I can't do in my head.  From memory, I can tell you what something looks like. I just can't *see* it in my minds eye.

Why does everyone say not to pee in the shower?,"I fully understand not peeing while taking a bath, but what is the big deal about peeing in the shower? I have never in my life heard a single legit reason other than the obvious ""pee is gross so don't do it"".

You are under a constant stream of water and there's already dirt, soap, whatever else you may need to scrub off going down the drain and human urine is less harmful to the environment than some of the things that get washed down the drain. And we all know that water doesn't get recycled through your tank. 

The only other reason I've ever been given is ""girls shouldn't because it just runs down their leg and that's gross, especially since they probably just shaved their leg so all those pores are opened up"" which, personally, my first response was `??????????????????` and my second was `no`.

I will fight to the end for my right to pee in the shower and this world isn't strong enough to stop me, I will show no mercy as my fluids release under warm euphoric streams of life-giving aqua.

But for real I am genuinely curious from an educational standpoint.

Edit: I know it isn't totally clear but I'm specifically referring to private showers, not something like a locker room shower or other communal showers. Some folks in the comments have been nice enough to point this out as a more common reason for that to be spread as a standard.

AITA for telling my son that if he changes his last name then I'm no longer his Father?,"Let me start off by saying my son, Adam, is 22 years old. Back when my ex wife, Tori, and I were trying for kids we found out that I was infertile. We decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. I was thrilled because I thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. No, I was wrong. My ex wife cheated on me and I didn't find out until 20 years later. 

Tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. My ex and I divorced a few weeks later. Ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological Father. He did and they started to become really close. It hurt me much more than I thought it would. 

He's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. They started to bond really well, and all of a sudden Adam became really distant from me. It's been like this for almost a year and a half. I try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with Chris (biological Father). I tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. We used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about Chris.

I couldn't stand it. My son who I raised since he was a baby treated me like I didn't matter. Any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. What I mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. I'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. He also changed his major from Econ to Computer Science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

I told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. He never did. I told him numerous times and he never changed. He was still distant.

What was the final straw for me was the phone conversation I had with him last week. He said he was going to change his last name to Chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I told him this ""I can't believe you are going to do this. That's really disappointing to me. If you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then I'm no longer your Father and I don't want to be involved in your life."" 

He hung up on me. I didn't even bother reaching out because I know he wouldn't respond. I stand by what I said. I meant every word and still do. The last name change to me means he no longer views me as a Father and views Chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

My family told me I'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. I was told to post it here. So Reddit am I being an asshole?

INFO: Something to add. After I found out about Chris I took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or Adam. They didn't contact me. I didn't contact them. I needed a break.

Edit 2: A lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and I think I finally figured out why he's been so cold. A few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. His Grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that I am fully in charge of. Enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. After a semester of university he started dating this girl. He was head over heels in love with her. 

I never met the girl so I have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. Suddenly after a few months of dating Adam asked me for about $3K to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. I already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. I asked Adam why he needed the money. He said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

I told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. He spent over 1K on her in just under a few months. He would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. To me she was just after my son's inheritance and I was right. What I said to him was basically this ""Adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. That's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. If you 2 were more serious then I would think about it, but I'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" Turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. They broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

He was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. Then we found out about my ex's affair. I don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. That was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",AmItheAsshole

I figured I owed you all one final update. Idiot neighbour will now forever be known as asshole neighbour. We received a letter from a law firm representing them. The letter basically says we put obstructions in the driveway when we knew they used it on a daily basis?!?!?!?!?! They are now willing to settle for the cost of repairs plus attorney costs. I don't know if expletives are permitted here or not but FUCK THEM. I may not be able to block them using our driveway (see below) but I won't be paying them anything ever.

We have heard back from the city police and they won't do anything unless we are threatened. A wave doesn't constitute a threat so they want no part of this.

I also got a copy of the property map and the city owns more than half the distance between the house and the road (give or take, the city portion is about normal car length). We are granted a right of way. Technically asshole neighbour has no right to use it but nothing will be done by the city to block this (and there is no bylaw against it). Lastly, we cannot trespass people on the city's portion of our driveway. I have a feeling that asshole neighbour was made aware of this sometime around when they started using our driveway again.

I have hired a lawyer - he has asked that I no longer post to social media. So, with that said, I'm out.",legaladvice

"[UPDATE] This man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, I have a specific question regarding something I want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.","I would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). Sorry for not updating you right away as I was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

So here's what happened. I liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. So I hired a guy which I'll call him Frank.

After waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

A few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom I recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. We went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. Shockingly he was completely understanding. He told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both Frank and I a settlement if I agree not to sue. I called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed Frank for his drone plus way more money that I would've ever paid him. He also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that I wont pursue any legal action.

It was a happy ending and I was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but I must admit that I feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. Never have I felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. While we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! So the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and I'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",legaladvice
AITA for walking into my flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave?,"I (20M) live in a flat with 5 others at university. There is one girl (20F), who's a bit of a...problem

She always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. Very loud. And it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. We told security and they didn't do shit.

So we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. And yesterday, she does it AGAIN, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. We're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).

I have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.

I had had enough. I banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. I bang again and she doesn't open. So I try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.

So I walk in and see them having sex. They both quickly see me and freak out. She says to me ''What the fuck?!!'' but I look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. 

She keeps saying ''What the fuck?!! Get out!!'' and I say to her ''I've had enough of your fucking shit. We've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. We're trying to sleep''. 

The guy is standing there awkwardly so I tell him ''Get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so I tell him ''I'll fucking call security, and I've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. 

So the ''problem'' girl starts crying and I tell her that she needs to sort her life out, I then to say to her ''Please leave this flat, move out. No one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.

I then leave and go to back to my room. I told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else I could have done. In fact they THANKED me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, AITA?

**To those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's NOT true. Aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**

**To the people telling me that I should have spoken nicely to her, I SAID IN THE FIRST FEW PARAGRAPHS I ALREADY DID THIS.

TIFU by watching my neighbours fight while I was eating popcorn.,"So I'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally I was watching the match on my living room little did I know there was another match going on my neighbours house. About ten minutes into my game, I started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.

Between the game and the distance between us I really couldn't distinguish any words, so I just raised the volume of my TV and kept watching. During half time I got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so I lower the volume of the TV as I microwave some popcorn.

By this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as I take the popcorns out of the microwave I hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so I went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case I had to call the cops of something. Now I have two dogs so I didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so I brought it with me.

So here I am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. For the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. By now I could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so I thought. Suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as I gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.

Now try to see this from their perspective. They've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. This got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.

""ENJOYING THE SHOW YOU \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!?""

I honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. They both flip the finger at me as walked inside ""Can YOU BELIEVE this fucking guy!?"" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.

When I got inside I was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.

Edit: I know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments I've gotten.  You all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! Also shut out to all the Cruz Azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game I was watching!

Edit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a TIFU and it probably isn't a dramatic one I'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.

TL;DR My neighbours were having a big fight while I was watching a soccer game, I went out to check while she slapped her husband as I was holding a big bag of popcorn. My nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again.",tifu

AITA for telling my friend I didn't appreciate paying for a $200 meal at her husband's birthday party?,"My friend invited my husband and me to a 40th birthday party for her husband. The party was going to be at a fairly upscale restaurant with dancing afterwards. We've been working on some remodeling projects, so we've been on a strict budget. My husband and I wanted to attend the party without breaking the bank, so we decided to share an appetizer and entree and only have one drink apiece.

When we got to the party, we were ushered into a private party room. When we were seated, we were given preplanned menus with several options for appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I asked a passing waiter if I could order a la carte instead of getting the preplanned menu. The waiter indicated that the meal was being paid for by the hosts and because were were part of the party, we needed to order form the preplanned menu.

My friend is a bit wealthier than we are and has always been really generous about their parties, but I was blown away that they would host 15+ people at this restaurant.

As the meal was ending, the main server approached my friend's husband with the check. My friend's husband seemed to be a little upset, and said, ""I know this isn't how you normally do things but we are only paying for the wine. We told you that."" I suddenly started panicking inside. I was trying to catch someone else's eye to see if they were panicking as much as I was. One other couple looked horrified, but everyone else seemed calm. I opened the check, and the total was $211. I thought I was going to throw up. I have never spent that much on a meal.

I held my shit together because I didn't want to make a scene. The couple that looked horrified sidled over to us and we asked if they knew how much it was going to cost and that our friend wasn't paying. They said they had asked waiter too, and he had indicated the hosts were paying.

I ended up messaging her and said, ""Thanks so much for inviting us to \*\*\*'s party. We had a great time. Just a heads up for next time, we really need to know if going to a party is going to cost more than $100. We are on a really tight budget, so a heads up would be appreciated. Thanks again.""

Update - My brother went missing 6 years ago. Police came yesterday to ask if we have seen him lately but didn't say why? How do we get more information. Illinois.,"https://redd.it/74we5z

I talked to the officer in charge of the investigation for my brother being missing. They found his name written in a notebook which belonged to a drug trafficker. The officer who was looking for him was wondering if my brother was still missing after talking to the officer in charge of that investigation.

There days later we received the call that they may have found my brother's remains and they needed DNA samples to confirm. DNA confirmed it was him.

What happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). That was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. That's when they decided to... His friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). Recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

The officer says my brother didn't die in pain. It was multiple gunshots. You'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. We had a funeral for him. Now there's a place that I can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

I thank all of you who helped.

If you genuinely want to check your child is your own - get a proper paternity test at  your local MedLab (medical lab). Ancestry tests are not accurate, and should not be used to test paternity. In my case, it simply raised the alarm to get a proper test.***

--------------

I apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. I posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested I ask on r/parenting. But I also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so I want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

First of all, I'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, I am not really in the best state of mind. My world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. I just want to write as much context as possible so I can get the best advice needed. For obvious reasons, I am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

Background: I met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. We have 5 beautiful children together - really, I consider them a total blessing regardless of what I'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago I thought that we had the perfect marriage. We were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, I feel like I've done everything a loving husband should do. I am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant I work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but I want to stress that I've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. And never in a million years would I ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

Now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. And the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested I was not her father. She confided this to me privately, showing me the results and I could tell she was visibly upset by this. Of course, the first thing I did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and I'll always love her unconditionally. But secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. It comes back and I am indeed not her biological father.

This news really broke me. I'm ashamed to say I broke down in tears in front of my daughter. The combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset I was making my daughter by how I was reacting. I really wish I had kept it in for her sake, but I didn't.

Following this I asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. I wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, I could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. However I didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really I didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

We tell the other three what has happened, I reassure them that I love them unconditionally and that I'll always be there dad, but that I need to know how long this has been going on. God, I can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. They didn't care I wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken I was. I feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

So we have paternity tests for each of the three done. Not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. Which somehow made it worse. It's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? I can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

So I confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. She doesn't confess. She doesn't even take it seriously. She says the tests must be flawed. All four? How the hell am I supposed to take that seriously?

I keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. When I bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""We've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. But how am I supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

Now that I have rambled and explained what has happened. I guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. How can I reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? I feel like the way I have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times I reassure them.

2. How do I handle my youngest daughter? I feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and I will need to tell my daughter something. I don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but I also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. Is there anyway, anyway at all, you think I could or should save my marriage? I've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. I know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. If there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, I want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: Found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. Wife refuses to confess her infidelity. Unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

Edit: Thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. I have not replied to as many comments as I should have, but I've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. I'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. Again, I can't begin to thank you for all your support. If this is resolved I might post an update, but if she continues to lie then I don't think I'll bother, as there's not much more I can add. From the advice in this and the r/parenting thread I've decided to:

1. Get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. Confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. Tell my youngest of the situation. Ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. It will be entirely her decision.

4. I'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. My mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and I owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. Depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), I have not ruled out some form of counselling. But at the moment I think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. Contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

Once again I'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

Edit2: I guess I should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **How did the ancestry results suggests I wasn't her father?** My family is entirely Irish. No relatives outside of Ireland other than my immediate family, and I even have the stereotypical red hair. My daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the British isles/western Europe/northern Europe. That's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **Which two children share the same father?** My two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **How did your wife conceive your children?** Our eldest daughter was not planned. All the others were planned. Each time we conceived several months after we started trying. Our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. She was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually I agreed. She was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **Are you infertile?** I don't know. I've never had a fertility test done. But the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that I might be. I will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

Doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. I'm 22 and no longer even live with her.,"Background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. My GP who I have seen since I was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. I moved away for college when I was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new GP and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since I've seen him half my life. 

I get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication I take to make sure that I'm not getting too little/too much. The results of this information or the fact that I have those tests done isn't a big secret I want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless I were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

The first time I had this work done, I hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. They even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/mL the medication level was. Again, it's not like to my mother this is anything I want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and I never received any call about my results. I go in for these monthly, so the next month that I went I told the woman working in the lab of the office that I wanted to update my information to make sure I got the results (I thought also since I had been seeing this doctor since I was 10 I probably had never given them my phone number). A few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; I again got no call from the office. Once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when I explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, I was a little tipped off that I wasn't called again. I chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

At this visit I had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. He asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. I wasn't worried that I was pregnant, but I knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. I asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. It did, so on my way out I stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that I and I alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. They nonchalantly agreed and I asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. I happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. My mom BLEW UP at me asking why I needed to take a pregnancy test (I didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). That all blew over, but at this point I was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

I ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of HIPAA and she knows it after working in a hospital. She laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since I was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - I'm your mom!""

Since then, I've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. To no surprise there are no issues. I don't really know what to do here. Since I cut ties with that doctor, I no longer have personal problems with this, but I'm sure other people do without even knowing it. I don't have resources really for a lawyer. I might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. So how serious is it really?

"(From an American point of view) We are running out of real problems, so we make up stuff to be mad about.","From my own personal experience, I feel like society is really trying hard to find things to be upset about.

I'm sure everyone has their own experiences, but here's a little background on me.... I was born in the US, but my parents are immigrants from the Middle East.  I was born into the opposite of wealth, debt.  We didn't have much growing up.  Both my parents busted their ass, making a life for myself and my siblings.  I grew up in Chicago.  We didn't come from any money, and my parents were not educated.  They learned how to speak English, and just went from there.  My dad worked as an appliance repair man, and my mom worked in retail.  We had little to nothing, but they did their best insulating us from the always impending financial ruin we were on the brink of.  My siblings and I picked up on that, but we didn't want to add stress to them and played dumb.  They kept working hard, saving, and tried to instill in us the value of hard work and integrity, and that some day good will come of it.  At the end of the day, we (the kids) all turned out great.  We all own homes in good neighborhoods, have money saved up, and have decent work.... Most importantly we lead our lives with honesty and integrity.

So I feel like my family started from the bottom, and through sheer dedication we all made it.  While this was tough, it was not as tough as life is where they came from.  Especially today as we are Iraqi Christians (but that's a whole other story).

I'm 32.  I've got a great job (even though I never finished college, couldn't afford to keep going, and my ethnic background didn't get me anything in terms of scholarships or financial aid like some of my friends), I finally own a home, have no debt other than my mortgage, I've got a bit saved up for a rainy day, and a pretty decent amount in my 401k for someone my age.  All of my accomplishments, and my family's have been through discipline and sacrifice.  I didn't buy the nice car, I bought the used Honda.  I didn't buy the fancy clothes, I went to discount stores.  I didn't eat out, I cooked every night.  I lived well within my means.

To my point.  I really feel like a lot of what people are angry about, fighting over, or are offended by, is complete bullshit.  Why have people gotten so soft?  Every time I turn on the news, talk to friends or people at the office, there's a new artificial outrage that's sweeping across the country.  Are there people still struggling with poverty, addiction, abuse, etc? Absolutely.  But I think those yelling and complaining the most are coming from some kind of privilege, or they can change their path but refuse to so they can remain a victim.

Is it just me or are things actually kind of ok and not that bad?  I just think the whining and yelling (especially from my generation) is unwarranted.  If that energy was applied to bettering themselves, they may discover there is upward mobility here in the US.  Is it evenly distributed? No, but life isn't fair.",unpopularopinion

My husband has sex with me while I sleep wth?,"Ive been married 5 years,  the sex is good and usually regular (providing we're not fighting) but my husband has been having sex with me while I'm asleep. I know it sounds crazy! Im a very heavy sleeper and he's taking advantage of it. On a few occasions I've awoke to him fingering me and about to put it in, if he knows I'm waking up, he stops. I am all for being woke up for sex but what is driving me crazy is that he stops every time and pretends like he isn't doing anything. I hate sleeping in clothes, I'm a naked sleeper but I don't think that is an open invitation right?

 Last weekend, I woke up again to him trying to get his dick in me, he froze until I acted like I was still asleep, I wanted to see how far this was going to go.  I pretended to sleep and wake up 3 different times, everytime I ""woke up"" he pulled out, heart racing and held me in position real tight until I fell back asleep,  finally he finished all over me and went to get up to get a towel and I said.... was that good for you? HE TRIED TO ACT LIKE HE WAS ASLEEP!!! I told him I was awake the whole time and asked why he did that and why he thought it was okay. His answer...I was horny, it wont happen again. 

Fast forward a week...I haven't been talking to him all week. I go to bed with clothes on all week because the thought of him doing it again just disgust me. I confront him about it, he acts like it's no big deal, I'm his wife so it should be fine, he wouldn't care if I did that to him and when I asked why he stopped when I woke up he says because he knew I'd be mad, he didnt want to get caught. I am trying to wrap my head around the whole thing. I'm pretty open minded, if it was a fettish or something, maybe I could be ok with it but he will not give me anything. 

At this point in feel like I can't trust  him anymore and I don't know what to do. Has anyone else ever dealt with this? Do you think I should believe him? He is only admitting to doing it this 1 time even though I've told him I've caught him before.

AITA for going to a nice restaurant with my wife and sharing a meal?,"My wife and I are not from the US but we have lived here for the last 2 years. On a friday or saturday once a month we will try a nice restaurant that we have not been to before in our city. However since we are not used to American portion sizes so we usually order much less food than what is considered normal.

When we go to a restaurant we will usually order an appetizer and main course and share both. We will also usually have one or two glasses of wine each, or sometimes we will share a bottle if we feel like it. However occasionally when the appetizer is large we just share the appetizer instead of ordering a main course.

Last night we went to a new restaurant that is considered a quite nice restaurant in the city ($20-30 per main course). When they brought out the appetizer it was very large so we shared it and we were definitely full so we didn't order a main course. We were also planning on having some wine later that night at home so we only had one glass of sparkling wine each.

When we asked for the bill, the waiter was shocked. He asked if we wanted anything else and we kindly said no but that the appetizer was delicious. After around 5 minutes we still didn't get the bill, but after close to 10 minutes either the owner or manager (don't know who he was) came up to us and gave us the bill and he said something like ""this is a ~~full~~ full service restaurant, you cannot just come in here and order an appetizer and leave"". He gave us the bill and asked us to never come back to the restaurant.

AITA here? This seems so foreign to me. We still ordered food and drinks, why are we less welcome than any other group? It shouldn't matter that it is a full service restaurant, people have different appetites.

"TIFU by Listening to Reddit and Eating my Girlfriends Ass, Which Caused a Peanut Allergy.","My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half. She is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but I've always told myself that I would never eat ass. I just think it's unsanitary and just gross. But she's dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but I've always deflected it. I decided I might finally give it a try, maybe it won't be so bad. If it's something she would really enjoy it, why not? But then a concerning thought entered my head.

I have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend LOVES paydays, the peanut candy bars. There is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. I wasn't sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. So I decided to ask reddit.

Most of the replies said that it shouldn't be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let's go for it.

She gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. It wasn't quite as bad as I thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. But after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and I could tell that my eyes were swelling up.

I pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her I'd be right back and ran to the bathroom. This obviously made her very self conscience. I was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when I came back I looked like Will Smith from Hitched when he eats the seafood. 

I had to explain to her that I was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. She told me I didn't ever have to do it again, so I guess there's a silver lining to the story.

TLDR: I have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.

My (23f) special needs brother (28m) is a savant with mixing beats. My other brother (18m-golden child) stole one of his beats with no credit and has been signed to a major Christian rock label. I'm so pissed but my parents say to stay out of it. What can I do?,"So this could go on for pages but I'll try to make it short. My older brother Timothy has severe autism and will never be able to be his own legal entity so as of right now, my parents have legal guardianship over him. I love Timothy so much and when my parents pass I will become his legal guardian per thier trust.

Timothy is absolute savant when it comes to mixing beats. They are true pieces of art but the way he wants is that they stay his. He has sold a few with the consent of my parents to national advertising companies and made a decent amount of money that went into his trust.

I also have a younger brother who is the literal spoiled golden child of the family. We have never gotten along and I barely have even brotherly love for him. He had gotten into the Christian rock genere and since he has a great voice and is a decent guitar player has found a decent amount of success with paid gigs at mega churches in our region.

Well recently my younger brother wrote a new song that has really taken off on Christian radio and in August he was signed to a really large (for the genre) contract with a Christian recording house. The problem is, younger bro literally stole one of Timothy's favorite beats for the hook to his song. It's so blatent as to be undeniable. M

Timothy is crushed over this because the beat in question was one of his favorites and he wanted to keep it his forever. I think at the very least he deserves a song writer credit and some of the money from the contract since the cat is out of the bag. Younger brother refuses to do any of this and claims it's his song. 

I've talked to my parents and a. They tell me to stay out of it since they are Timothy's legal guardians it's thier choice and b. Accuse me of being jealous of younger brothers success and trying to ruin his career. I am FURIOUS with my parents and brother and don't know what to do. It's so unfair I can't even sleep at night.

AITA for telling my kid I would help him get a Switch if he can beat Ocarina of Time?,"My 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a Nintendo Switch so he can play BOTW. Right now he has $200 saved up. At his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

I know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn't been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. Now I have to say, he's a really good kid. Kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. He's been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

Instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, I thought of a more fun solution to help him get his Switch. I told him, if you can beat Ocarina of Time (without Googling for help - though I would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old N64, I'll pay for the rest of your Switch and get you BOTW. Wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. Part of my reasoning too is I just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and OoT is a timeless classic. 

He jumped at the idea! After a weekend of playing, he's already at Zoras domain as young link. He seems to be having fun with it and hasn't gotten too frustrated yet. He's only played Minecraft really so the dated graphics don't bother him either. 

But anyway I told a couple friends about it, and they think I'm a massive dick. That I'm trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that I should just get him the Switch because he's already such a good kid. Now I'm having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge.

"Parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl","I've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. My parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

These girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

I'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but I feel they still need to be taught that. 

And same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

Edit; If a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. Self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. He definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

Same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. If that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

This post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. That way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. Men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",unpopularopinion
WIBTA for exposing my late wife to my sons?,"Please bear with me while I try to gather my thoughts and explain just what's going on. I (M40)was married to my wife (F38) for 18 years. We had what I thought was a perfect relationship, we barely fought, got along great, and she was my best friend. We had two sons together, J who is 14 and M who is 16. 

My wife passed extremely unexpectedly a month ago and it absolutely shattered our world. I feel so alone and have even started going to counseling to help with getting over her. 

Here is the hard part. Two nights ago I decided to go through my wife's cell phone to read our text messages and look at some photos she had taken I never got sent. That's when I found the messages after I decided to look through her browser history. 

Messages to men in their 60's sending dirty photos she had sent me. Nights she told me she was visiting her sister, she was actually out with these men doing god knows what for money. I don't want to get into to much detail with how filthy some of they were, but I cannot believe she could have done this to me. I suspected nothing. Ever. 

My sons are obviously still crushed and always talking up their mother and how sweet, amazing she is. How much they miss her love and honesty. I cannot see her as the woman I thought I knew and I am torn on what to do. On one hand, I don't want to make this passing harder for them and hinder their thoughts about their mother but on another hand I feel they are old enough to know the truth. 

WIBTA if I exposed my late wife to my sons and told them what she was really doing to our family? Please help me.


EDIT: Wow. Thanks for all the feedback. I never knew that me losing a best friend, wife and mother of my children would end with me being berated. This post didn't come from malicious intent to hurt my children, and I apologize if it came out that way. I asked because I truly don't know. I feel that I would have wanted to know who my mother was fully but I can see why so many disagree. 
This is something that I will keep to myself for now- and if my children ever inquire further that's something I will deal with along the way. 

To all the ones who were kind, thank you. And to those calling me a selfish piece of shit I hope you are never put in my position. Thank you.

LAST EDIT: It's now been about 24 hours since my post- which I never thought would get front page- and I want to thank everyone who has reached out to me. I understand that 'exposing' was a very poor word choice and came across the wrong way. I'm still trying to message everyone back who has privately reached out. 
As I said earlier, this will be something I keep to myself and have a talk about truth with my sons down the road. I'm meeting with her family today to figure out what to do about her things and what else. I'm also looking into therapists for my sons today like many of you have mentioned.",AmItheAsshole
People are getting too weak-minded and passive. Confrontation is useful in some situations and we should really stop treating it like the worst thing in the world.,"How many times has this happened: someone is complaining and talking shit about something to you but outright refuses to directly address their problem and clams up when confronted with it.

People need to start standing up for themselves more. There is nothing wrong with directly disagreeing or arguing against something you aren't okay with. We need to stop bottling animosity up and venting about it to randoms instead of dealing with the problem.

Nobody ever wants to be the person that speaks out against something for fear of social repercussions and that's a really sad place to be in.",unpopularopinion

"[UPDATE] I feel like my white boyfriend is mainly with me for the novelty of being with a ""pretty black girl"" and clout.","We didn't get the chance to see each other all week, but we managed to link on Saturday. I wanted to speak about things in person.

I didn't want to go in all accusatory so I just started to say how I feel (it's a good idea who knew lmao). I talked to him about how hearing his friend stereotype black people, and my boyfriend laughing and agreeing with him made me feel.

How ""Cool black kids"" were a prop for them at their partners. Just a source of entertainment and that upset me. They let them in with the expectation that they'll dance and turn up in a way that'll make the party cooler. There is ALWAYS a moment at these parties always have the black people dancing in a small small circle doing their thing and everyone else surrounds and sc them. It's like a show. I thought it was a coincidence until I knew it was kinda...orchestrated? Black guy walks in and they throw them the aux. Not to mention there were no black guys in the frat or in any of their inner social circles, but they love to have them around to dance for them. I told him that I didn't even want to get into letting ""hot black girls in"" hoping they'll twerk. But I talked about how it felt like that's how he saw me. He listened to me the entire time without jumping in and I've never had someone do that before so I appreciated it.

He spoke and said that because of where he grew up, he was used to tolerating fuckshit. That's just how people talked around him and way worse behind closed doors. But never spoke up or anything and he thought that was cool as long as he wasn't saying it. He sees things differently than I do sometimes, but being with me, he's trying to do better. Also that, choosing who gets into a party and who to hook up with is purely superficial. But you can't be with someone for almost a year just because they have a pretty face. Then we talked about why we were with each other and I won't get into it, but it was really sweet and emotional.

Then we started talking about the ""Drip or drown"" for guys and **""If she's not a nine, she stays outside""** for girls.

We both agreed it was an awful way to talk about people. He was Frats parties are superficial, and so are clubs and they let people in the same way. But the more people want to get in, the higher the standards get. At the end of the day, they can let in whoever in they want. It's their home and they don't have to make it available for everybody if they want to.

His dad was in a frat (his cousins too) and his sister was a sister. It offers a life-long brotherhood, networking and advantages for the field he's pursuing. Plus, they're just fun to be in.

So everything worked out and we're just taking things day by day.

Also people got so mad because I called myself pretty. Women are told to accept compliments all the time, but I do it...it makes me conceited? I'm hella pretty and I know it. Stay mad.

But to everyone else, thank you so much for the support and advice.

**Edit: Guys I read the comments and I'm more confused...I really thought that we had a mature conversation and he promised to better, to call out his friends and tolerate it anymore. He listened to me and I thought all I could do is wait until I see if he follows up. He seemed genuine and I do give him the benefit of the doubt. But maybe I shouldn't...Idk here.**

**I've never dated outside my race and I have mostly black friends, so I've never been in this position before. I came here to get different opinions and I did. I guess what I'll do now is watch closely. I really didn't see things this way and thanks for the input and guidance.**",relationship_advice
"Purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. Now what? [NY, Putnam County]","Mostly what's in the title. Condo was vacant for roughly 60 days between closing and our attempt to move in. Upon getting there with our belongings, we discovered a new deadbolt on the door - the unit was vacant and had no deadbolt when we did our final walkthrough the day before closing. Tried knocking on the door. got no answer, reached out to our realtor, who contacted the seller's agent and asked that he get in touch with his client to find out what the hell is going on, but at this point we assumed squatters. About an hour later, a young man showed up and produced a 36 month lease  which had been paid in advance. All $1 of it. He told us it's between us and his uncle, and headed into the apartment.

Our realtor is flabbergasted; he's encountered squatters and tenants who had to be evicted after refusing to leave at the end of the lease, but never anything like this. The police won't touch this either, which makes perfect sense given the context - dude has a lease that predates our contract (albeit by one day) so as far as they're concerned it's a civil matter. The condo association is incredibly hands-off about owners leasing their properties (which is part of why this place was appealing, as I plan to rent it out myself when we are ready to buy a house), so they want nothing to do with the situation.

To me it seems like the lease should be completely void given that it was executed in ridiculously bad faith, but I am nowhere near a lawyer. To that end, the attorney who handled the transaction for us is out of town till next week - my understanding is that he's camping or hiking or hunting or something along those lines and is basically incommunicado for the time being, but I am waiting to hear back from his admin to get details (he's a one man firm so there are no associates that can help me in the interim).

I have no idea what to do here. Luckily the truck we were using to move is owned by a friend's business, and they have graciously offered to let us store our belongings in it while we get this sorted. Unluckily, my wife and I turned in the keys to our old apartment this morning, and as such we have nowhere to go.

I'd be willing to do a cash for keys thing to get this guy out of our apartment but he won't speak to us. Beyond that, do I have grounds to evict him? If so, how do I recoup the expenses associated with this whole clusterfuck, sue the seller? Does the tenant have any sort of liability here? If I do pull of a successful cash for keys arrangement, can I sue the seller for that as well? What about the friend who is letting us keep all of our stuff in one of his trucks, does he have any grounds to sue or does the fact he is voluntarily letting us use the truck take that out of the equation? Is there anything else that I am not thinking of?

I am shaking with anger right now so I apologize for this being a bit of a a rambling novel, and thanks in advance for any advice you can offer.

Edit: Location is New York, specifically Putnam County.

**Update (4:45PM):** I just got a call from my attorney's admin. He's apparently close enough to civilization to have an internet connection in his cabin and should be checking in with her shortly, at which point she'll have him reach out to me. Apparently he was a civil litigator before he ""retired"" to real estate law, and she thinks he'll welcome an excuse to step into his old shoes and tear these people apart. Needless to say I am looking forward to hearing from him.

**Update 2 (5:25PM):** Just heard from both my realtor and my attorney. The evening seems to have found a way to get even more interesting, but the truck owning friend is about five minutes out with my car. We're going to meet my realtor for dinner, my closing documents and some badly needed drinks (said the guy who doesn't really drink). I'll update tomorrow morning if not tonight, but till then...

"My[38m] wife [24f] of 3 years, took my daughter[14f] to visit her parents in Russia. Wife doesn't want to come back","Like above. Sorry for ranting and any grammar errors I've been sitting in an airport for over almost 9 hours and making a lot of calls and had a bit to drink. Also this is a throwaway so I don't completely dox myself. 

My wife went to visit her parents who live in a small suburb outside of St. Petersburg, Russia. 

My wife herself was born there, and came to the US when she was around 18 years old - when we first met. (This is NOT a mail order bride scenario or anything of the sort). I was finishing my up my post-grad, she was starting her undergrad - one thing lead to another and here we are. 

As she was a student when we first met, she did not anticipate meeting me and us getting so deeply involved - so she never planned on staying in the US. It just kind of happened that way. (She entered on a F1 visa then a k1 visa now she has a green card). 

Understandably, she misses her family a lot, though for the most part we've been extremely happy together, minus the standard few squabbles here and there. 

3 years ago we had two wedding ceremonies, one in the US with my family and one in Russia with her family and a mix of my immediate family. 

Until last week she hadn't seen her family since the wedding due to her finishing up school and helping out my daughter, as I have custody. 

As school wrapped up for her, and as a graduation gift, we decided it'd be a good idea for her to go visit her family for a week. She wanted to bring my daughter with her - I initially was opposed to this - but I caved and let her bring her(my daughter wanted to go) 

Through her trip she hasn't been too much in contact with me aside the occasional message on WhatsApp and photos etc. which is understandable - she's on vacation and I don't expect constant alerts, but I would have liked a little more of an update. My daughter has been texting me almost daily and showing me photos as well. 

Yesterday morning I had texted my wife that I'd be there to pick them at the airport at the time she had told me the flight arrived. She read the message but never answered. I told my daughter the same and she never responded. I assumed they were just busy and left it at that. 

I had a hellish day at work so I went right to bed so I could be up early to go get them. 
I wake up today stupidly without checking my app and go to the airport, the arrival time comes and I look at my phone to message them. I see about 60 messages from my daughter panicking starting nearly 15 hours ago saying that she missed her flight and doesn't know how to get home. Confused as shit - she tells me my wife basically told her how to get home and then dropped her off at the airport. 

 Panicked I reach out to her and blow up her whatsapp. She finally answers and sends a long 3 paragraph essay on how she has missed her family so much she doesn't want to leave them and she wants to stay longer. 

Pissed off that she waited to tell me this, she left my daughter alone at an airport in another country, that I took off work to come today to get her, and how this is so last minute - I go off on her through text. She tells me off and stops answering me. 

I reach out to her mom through WhatsApp (who doesn't speak English at all) and using google translate ascertain that she wants to stay for another month for her brothers birthday party. Her mom said she didn't know this was going on and went to the airport to go help my daughter get back safely. 

Panicked I go to reach out the US consulate in Saint Petersburg only to find online it was shut down in March and the nearest is in Moscow. I reach out to the Moscow one and luckily get almost an immediate response and they were a HUGE help in getting my daughter on her correct flights. Even having someone meet her on the connecting airport to help her to the right terminal safely. 

My wife still hasn't answered me since our blow out. And her mom said she hasn't seen or heard from her since this morning.

I (30f) have just been diagnosed with an illness and am struggling to forgive my husband (39m) for not believing me.,"We have been together for 5 years, throughout those 5 years (and about 3 years before I met him) I have had numerous medical issues that I have had to deal with. Nothing life threatening but certainly life affecting.

Sporadically occurring symptoms have included chronic muscle and joint pain to the point I struggled to get out of bed, skin infections, serious fatigue, hair loss and frequent cold/flu like viruses. 

At first he was really understanding, would comfort me and sympathise with how doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong but for the last year and a half he has started suggesting it's in my head or I'm exaggerating the symptoms.  This hurt so badly because doctors for that last several years have basically said the same thing. I was prescribed pain killers, told I was 'just' depressed and given AD's, or just straight up dismissed. So I stopped bothering. 

Then about two months ago I had to go get a script filled and she was so lovely that I started talking about some of this stuff. She ordered a bunch of tests and through intensive questioning and reviewing of my medical history I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease. 

Thankfully it's something that with appropriate medical care and treatment it can be managed and I'm now starting to feel better. My husband has profusely apologised and has been really supportive but I still feel hurt and kind of betrayed that he didn't believe that I knew there was something wrong. He saw the pain I was in but believed I was putting it on.

We've spoken about it but it still hurts, I don't know how to move on.",relationship_advice

An atheist dies and goes to hell.,"The devil welcomes him and says:""Let me show you around a little bit.""
They walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace. ""This is your house now, here are your keys.""
The man is happy and thanks the devil. The devil says:""No need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!""

They continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. ""These are your cars now!"" and hands the man all the car keys. Again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says ""Everyone down here gets some cool cars! How would you drive around without having cars?"".

They walk on and the area gets even nicer. There are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere.
They arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn¬¥t be any happier. The devil says ""Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don¬¥t want anyone to be lonely!""

As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur is in the air.

Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""What is going on there?""
The devil just shrugs and says: ""Those are the christians, I don¬¥t know why, but they prefer it that way""

I found a non-profit in my area that helps artists and creatives find lawyers who are willing to help them pro bono.

My lawyer sent a carefully worded letter saying we'd like the painting back or the value of the painting paid to me, minus the shop's commission - or I'd be pursuing the issue in small claims court.

I didn't hear from her for a few weeks, but then got a sickeningly sweet text saying she managed to track the person down who supposedly bought the painting from the shop, bought it back, and it was ready to pick up (wow, she's a hero!). But not at the shop -- at her home. I sent my boyfriend to grab it to avoid a bizarre confrontation with her. She left it on the porch and wouldn't answer the door. She left a valuable painting on her porch, outdoors, for hours. Whatever, I have it back and never have to talk to her again.

Thank you all for the advice! I'd like to send my lawyer a thank you -- what would be appropriate?

My mother (50F) asks me (20F) to travel home to wake up my teenage brother (15M),"Hi everyone,

This morning I was yelled at down the phone by my mother for refusing to travel 1 hour home and back to wake my 15 year old brother up for school. She has always babied and coddled him, to the point where he is 16 this year and she still puts his socks on for him, brings all his meals and snacks to him and makes zero attempt to help him mature. He is never left home alone, she tells him what to do and when, and both of my parents lives revolve around him. He does not know how to boil a kettle, and has never done anything independently. If he doesn't want to do something, he will have a tantrum. I would like to point out that he has no learning difficulties or anything like that that would explain this. He has just not grown up. My birthday day out to London was cancelled because he didn't want to go, and I was called selfish as a result. I am 20, I've been living away from home at university one city away for about 2 years now.

Previously, she has asked me to come home from university to walk my brother 15 minutes home from school, at 4pm, along a route he has done 1000x before. Yesterday, she called me to ask if I would come home from uni on Wednesday to put my brother's dinner on as she is going to a funeral. A sad event, but of a relative she rarely sees who is very old and died naturally. I am not saying she shouldn't go to the funeral, just that it was not out of the blue. She had been preparing for this for a while. I said I wasn't happy about it, but I didn't have plans that day, so fine.

This morning she calls me to say the funeral was at 9:30am so she'd be back by tea-time. I thought great, no reason for me to come home as my brother is at school. But actually she now wants me to come back Tuesday evening (late) after volunteering and a busy day. Tuesday evening is the only time I get to see my boyfriend this week, so I said no. The reason she wants me to come back is so I can wake my brother up for school Wednesday morning and make sure he locks the front door. I told her that was too much of an ask for something he can do himself, and she proceeded to call me a selfish child, and that 'we all have to do things we don't want to do' and that she has made sacrifices for me. At this point I just said I wasn't having this conversation and hung up. I then text her to explain that I don't want to come back for multiple reasons- my boyfriend, I have a busy day on Tuesday, and it's just not practical. Plus the reason she wants me to come back is ridiculous, as he is almost 16 and can easily set an alarm. I shouldn't have to travel 2 hours round-trip to wake my 16 brother up for school.

So, am I being unreasonable? I understand she is going to a funeral, but surely this is unacceptable. I am a 20 year old woman with a life of her own in a completely different city. If my brother had to be left alone for days of course I would come back, or if something sudden happened. But he is almost 16, and will literally be at school for most of the day they want me back. He should be able to wake himself up for one day, get himself breakfast and walk out the door- he gets picked up by someone else's mum before school.

Any advice at all would help.

TLDR: My mum is going to a funeral on Wednesday and wants me to travel a 2 hour round trip to wake my 15 YO brother up for school. She has a history of babying him and I'm a university student with my own life in a different city. Am I wrong to say no and that he should just set an alarm seeing as I have other plans? Edit: typo. 

Update: I called my dad to explain the situation and he said he agreed with my mother and that I was a disappointment to the family. He said it was not about what they asked me to do but that they rarely ask for help and when they do I should always help where I can- it was the principle that counts. He also said I was opening a can of worms and that there's a lot I should be doing at 20 that I'm not. When I asked what I should be doing he said driving, which is ridiculous as I live in a big city and the only reason I'm not learning is because it's too expensive and would be useless when I can easily bus/train everywhere. He knows this. He then repeated he was disappointed in me and I hung up the phone, upset, after saying I don't know want more they want me to do. I had a job I've saved my wages from so I can budget accordingly, I do well at university, I am good with money, I have responsible friends and a great boyfriend, I make time to see my parents when I can.

AITA for getting annoyed with the a guy playing his guitar in a coffee shop?,"I was sitting at a table in a coffee shop yesterday when this guy comes in to the shop carrying a guitar and orders a drink. He then happens to choose the space right next to my table to stand and play his guitar while waiting for his order. 

I find people who force their music on others very annoying. This guy and his guitar are no different from someone playing music from a Bluetooth speaker in a public area in my mind. But I was lucky in this case - I didn't have to stick around. Without speaking to the guy or even making eye contact, I stood up and moved to the complete opposite side of the shop to a new table by the exit. 

Well the guy must have noticed my displeasure because he stopped playing after I moved. A few moments later he got his drink and moved towards the exit to leave. He opens the door to leave, pauses, then turns to me and says ""You could have just asked me to stop playing. Treat me like a human being."" And then continued out the door before I could respond. 

So this guy is acting like I'm the asshole for not verbally engaging with a stranger who annoyed me. I feel like simply removing myself from the area when possible is usually the right play and leads to less conflict. AITA?",AmItheAsshole
Thanks r/relationship_advice for being so blunt!,"I (33f) posted in here about 2.5yrs ago under an old profile regarding my marriage. The post was taken down by a mod for violating a rule or two, though I'll be damned if I remember which. However, I did get some great comments. My old post had to do with the shit way my (43m) husband  was treating me‚Äîfinancially abusive, emotionally neglectful, cheating, lying asshole. At the time I was still a stay at home mom to my younger two girls, and he was becoming increasingly hostile towards my oldest daughter from a previous relationship. Well reddit, it took a while, and a few more really hard lessons, but in September 2018 I moved out of my marital home and into my very own townhome. If I had never posted here, I would only have my own perception of the relationship, instead of knowing how it looks to others. I now work full time, go to college part time. I started to open up to those close to me, and garnered the support I needed to gtfo. I had originally arranged to move out on a Monday while he was at work, but Murphey's law kicked in at the last minute and HE STAYED HOME SICK THAT DAY! My oldest daughter had stayed home from school to help me move, and we had reserved a moving truck, so when she asked what we were going to do, I told her we would move anyway. He slept through my first load, having no idea of my plans because he'd have been even more financially abusive if he knew what I was planning. When he realized what was going on, he got very angry, lots of threats etc. But, I got out, we worked out a way to coparent without wanting to murder each other (often), and divorce is somewhere in the future. Sorry if this isn't for this thread, but I just had to say thanks for being so blunt about my failing marriage that it made me cry sad and angry tears. I needed it.

TIFU by eating oreos and making my mom think she was going crazy.,"This happened around 2010 when I was roughly 24 years old. I still lived at home with my Mom who always had a sweet tooth. Now, by this time she was suffering from some early onset dementia and did not work, so she had a lot of time on her hands. She liked to call customer service numbers and give them a hard time about little things for some human interaction, in my opinion. She had been calling Nabisco several times about her opening brand new Oreo packages and finding the center row of the tray  almost completely devoid of Oreos. I knew this because she had mentioned it and would leave notes from her phone calls around. I rolled my eyes as I was used to her being a little nutty. According to her, it kept happening and she began taking photos of the Oreos each time it happened to try to prove to Nabisco that she wasn't making this up. I assumed she was eating them and forgetting.  One day, I'm in the kitchen and I open up a brand new package of Oreos and grab several from the center row.  As I start walking away, it hit finally hit me! She didn't realize that Oreo had updated their packaging to having the Easy Open Pull Tab on the top! She was still opening the side of the package and sliding the tray out. I was the Oreo thief the whole time and didn't know it! We had a good laugh over it. My Mom died shortly thereafter in January 2012 and my sister bought me an Oreo Christmas ornament. I smile as I recall the Oreo Incident when I decorate my tree each year. 

TL;DR - I was using the new Easy Open Pull Tab on the top of Oreo packages while my mom was still opening the package from the side and sliding the tray out which led to her thinking Nabisco was shorting us Oreos.",tifu

Them: ""what do you mean beef gelatin? Why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?""

Me: ""I thought all gelatin came from animals.""

Them: ""are you serious? You aren't serious right? I love gummy bears. My kid and I eat them together all the time."" (kid is vegetarian as well)

Me (now panicking): ""I think I am. I don't know. Maybe you're right! I'm 
sorry! You're welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.""

They now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. I swear I could see them going through the stages of grief because I know how sad I would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. So TIFU by shattering a vegetarian's blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.

TL;DR TIFU by informing a vegetarian who loves gummy bears that gelatin comes from animals, thus ruining gummy bears for them (and subsequently their child)

Edit: omg. Front page. All you guys are awesome! And I'm learning so much! I just want to clarify a couple of items. First, this coworker of mine isn't preachy at all or anything. I just happen to know their choice and respect it, I have no idea if it's for health or ethical or sensory reasons or whatever. Second, my understanding is that their child chooses to also follow a vegetarian diet but is encouraged to try anything they want, so no forced vegetarianism on the child (Yay!). I'm excited about all the dialogue. And feeling a little drunk on the power of knowledge. But pretty please don't bash my co-worker for their dietary choices because, ultimately, it is their choice :)...and they don't judge me for eating candy for breakfast. Thanks Reddit world!

Edit2: formatting (thank you to the user who showed me the way. Hopefully it's a bit better now). Also, thank you for the awards!! But! It they are costing you money, please donate said money to a charity near you that feeds hungry people. Or buy a vegetarian friend a bag of vegetarian friendly gummy bears!",tifu

Today her mom came and told me that it's a actually assault to cut a minor's hair without parental consent and she's going to sue me for $10,000 for destroying her daughter's beautiful hair. The whole assault thing sounds like bullshit as boys under 18 come in all the time on their own and get haircuts.

AITA for wanting to abort my late husband's baby?,"My husband died a week ago and I'm 13 weeks pregnant. My in-laws know and they want me to keep the baby so there's a piece of him alive. When I mentioned I might get an abortion they flipped out on me, called me every name in the book and selfish, at which point I broke down in tears and left.

I don't know what to do. On one hand I can understand what they mean, if I abort there's nothing of my husband left. But I just... Don't know. I can end this chapter of my life and move on. I don't know what to do. I know a lot of you are thinking it's amazing I'm pregnant and I can always have a piece of him through my baby but that's the thing, I can't decide if I want that or not. I've never been more conflicted in my life and I have to stop thinking about it so I don't miscarry from the stress.

Edit: I don't know how many people will see this but I want to thank everyone who offered support and shared their stories with me via PM, I'm truly moved. I'm still undecided on what to do moving forward but I I'll try and find someone to talk to. Some more context if anyone's wondering:

*  My husband died by suicide because he was too stressed out about his career. No one really saw it coming.
*  I don't have any children, or family. My sister is the only one I know and she's on the other coast. I'm 25.
*  I don't know if I'm going to abort, however *if* I do carry the baby full term, I'd rather take care of it myself and not give it up for adoption.
*  I'm in New York which has some of the toughest grandparent rights laws which further complicates things. I'm afraid of giving birth then having custody taking away from me.
*  My financial situation is... okay. I can support my baby and I if I budget down.
*  My relationship with my in-laws was never friendly. They didn't approve of me and despite trying to warm relations with them they never reciprocated.
*  Some people are questioning why I'm trying to move on so fast and saying I'm awful for it: The baby is growing and I can't hit pause. I need to make up my mind sooner than later.

  My mind still isn't made up and likely won't be soon. I'll take some time off to think and talk to someone about this situation. Also to the very colorful PM's telling me to kill myself, go fuck yourself. Thank you.

"I (20F) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27M) phone. I am sick, devastated and don't know what to do.","First time poster so I apologize if this is rambly. To preface: I started dating David (not real name obv) at the beginning of February.  Only a few weeks after getting out of a 5 year relationship I was nervous about getting into another one but we clicked so well that I didn't think much more about it. I fell hard and he did too. Things had been wonderful, and we were even considering moving in together at the end of the month (all 4 roommates moved out and I can't afford the place by myself). He and I have also casually spoke about not ever wanting children and I have never seen him behave oddly around kids in the short time I've known him, so I didn't really see any red flags there. Everything seemed to indicate he had a great head on his shoulders, and we spend almost all of our time together. 

Last week I came into my room after making us some dinner and he was obviously masturbating; he quickly shut his phone off and I played it off like I had no idea what he was doing. Fast forward to two days ago, I was curious as to why he would try and hide it from me (I don't care if he watches porn) and curiosity got the better of me. So when his phone was unlocked and he left it on my bed, I quickly peeked through his search history. There was tons of porn - all the time - all conventional websites and mostly ""teen"". I didn't think much of that (though it does kind of gross me out) and kept scrolling and then I saw some search terms that made my heart drop into my stomach. ""p*do pics"" etc had been entered around 5 times. 

I quickly put his phone away and panicked a bit, I had no idea what to think but my intuition told me there was more to find. I couldn't imagine someone just randomly getting the urge to look it up; I know enough to know these fetishes develop over a lifetime. So last night I peeked through his photos on his iPhone and was traumatized. There were photos of me taken asleep, of my breasts, close ups of my genitals and even photos he had taken while I'd fallen asleep on his chest and he had put my hands down his pants. I felt weirded out and a bit violated by these photos but it got so much infinitely worse. 

A bit further up in his photos I discovered around two dozen photos and gifs of young children (youngest was probably 5 or 6) engaging in sexually explicit positions, exposing their privates and even adults engaging in sex with small girls in a couple of gifs. They all appeared to be downloaded off of the internet. I was numb, i was angry, I was devastated, I couldn't think and I was so disturbed at what I was witnessing. I have never seen CP in my life and I can't get these horrible images out of my head. I scrolled pretty far up and didn't really see anything else of children like that but there were definitely lots of photos of girls who would definitely fall into the ""petite teen"" category. 

I guess I'm just posting here because I have no idea what else to do. I don't know how to confront him and I know I must separate from him immediately but I'm terrified of involving police; our local police are not very useful and I don't want to get in trouble. He must have accessed these photos using my home internet.  He practically already lives here as well, and was going to help me finance a new lease somewhere else. Not that that gives me any desire to stay with him but financially I am fucked by this. 


Please help Reddit, I feel so lost.

Worlds fastest update - refused DNA test (CA),"While I was getting my ass handed to me in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9is8jh/refused_dna_test_california/), a coworker confessed to the assault. From what I hear, the dna tests were just a threat to put pressure on this one dude who they suspected, I don't think they actually took anyone's dna.


Many people pointed out that I sounded sketchy in my original post. That was probably true. I'm a recovering addict (three years clean and sober), and I did a lot of crazy stuff in my past- not raping anyone, but junkie shit like breaking and entering, squatting, getting in fights, etc. I didn't know you could get a paternity test for an unborn baby, so I thought they were just going to put my dna in a database, and maybe things I never got caught for would come up. If I knew I was just being tested against a baby, I would have said sure.


I want to say that *because* of my past, I'm a squeaky clean employee- I never so much as swipe a snack from the pantry or an Advil from the med cart. We're not supposed to ever be alone with members, and I never am, even if I'm just dropping off a tray in someone's room, or if a member has work detail in the kitchen. I guess I was acting paranoid because I was pissed about being suspected when I've tried so hard to be straight, and that ended up making me seem more suspicious. 


Hopefully now that the guy who did it was arrested, things can go back to normal. I hope the woman who was raped is doing okay (she's not here anymore, and I don't know what is happening). Sorry for the novel, but I wanted to let everyone know what was going on. 


**Edit:** I think the reason everyone was so mad at me in the original post was because I was acting like *I* was the victim, even though obviously that was not the case. That is some of that addict mentality, that I'm still working on with my sponsor.",legaladvice

"TIFU by instead of sucking the dick, the dick suck me","Today my cousin bought an 8 inch black realistic suction cup dildo as a birthday present for my brother, whom in horror discarded the obscene dingus. Being the saint that I am, I adopted this orphaned device. 

My friend and I provided the poor discarded ornament with a purpose, I replaced the toilet roll holder with our new trinket, which worked fabulously. 

However, the mere potential of comical joy to be experienced was wasted on such a mundane destiny, and thus I proceeded to stick the suction end to my forehead and become the unicorn I was meant to be... I had reached my comical peak. As we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead I could feel something was terribly wrong. 

I heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. Upon my forehead I had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. The curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm. 

I leave for Italy in 8 hours for my summer holiday.... my friends won't be able to look at me in the eyes. I fear for what the security at the airport may think of my battle wound.

AITA for locking a kid in the bathroom?,"I(26F) am single and currently living in an apartment with my cat. Next door lives what looks like a single mother(40+-) and her son(8). I work early shifts, so I am usually home in the afternoons and would spend the rest of the day playing video games or painting.

The mother next door sometimes would drop her son by my door and ask me to look after him as she goes out, she would usually pick him up a few hours later. I am actually quite reluctant to help but consider that they may be in difficult situations I just suck it up. It's not like I have to babysit or entertain him, just letting him play my video games for a few hours and that's all. The son sometimes makes a mess by rummaging through my things but I could handle that by telling him off and tidy them up later. 

It was another one of the days when I let the son in and left him be. For a while everything seemed to be fine, until I realized that my cat was missing. I looked everywhere but she was nowhere to be seen. I then turned to the kid and asked if he had anything to do with it, but he was busy with his game and brushed me off impatiently. Some time later, I found my terrified cat in the FREEZER.

I confronted the kid and demanded to know why he did that? He swore to god that he had nothing to do with it at first, then changed his words and said that the cat jumped in when he took some ice for his drinks. I then ignored his protests and locked him in the bathroom for the rest of his stay till his mother came to pick him up.

Not surprisingly the mother was furious about how I treated her son. I told her that I did it for the safety of my cat because I found her precious kid trying to kill her. She argued that I could have locked up my cat instead, in which I replied that I had no obligation looking after her son in the first place. She threatened to press charges against me before storming away with her son. 

I shared this with my friends and while some said I should have rejected them a long time ago, others said I went too far. What do you think?


Edit: I need to point out that the agreement to ""look after"" the kid was that I only needed to allow him inside and play video games and he stays till his mother returns. I am no ""babysitter"" and I made it clear to the mother, in which she agreed to it and still asked for my help.


For those who wondered, kid wasn't locked up for ""hours"", maybe 30min~ or so, I don't really remember, was busy checking on my petrified cat. The cat is fine too.",AmItheAsshole
WIBTA for contacting the mom of my daughter's (15F) boyfriend (15M) regarding some concerning behavior and messages?,"So my 15 year old daughter is in her first ""serious"" relationship with a boy she was friends with before they started dating.  I put serious in quotes because while they spend time together frequently, they are only ever alone in public places like the mall.  My daughter and I have a good relationship and she has shared that they haven't done anything more than kiss at this point.  I am not naive enough to think they couldn't be doing more, but my daughter has given me no reason to mistrust her.

The problem is that the more time they spend together, the more demanding of her time the boyfriend is becoming.  He calls and texts her constantly and gets upset when she doesn't respond immediately.  She has explained to him that she is not tied to her phone, especially during the summer when she is doing things outside or with friends.  He has told her that he worries about her when she doesn't answer, and if she really loved him she wouldn't make him worry.  She recognizes this as manipulation and has told him that it is not okay.

She sat him down and explained that she does not like how demanding and controlling he is becoming, and explained that if he doesn't stop she will break up with him.  I was very proud of the way she handled it.  We have taught both of our kids that it is important to define your boundaries and then expect the people around you to respect them, as well as taking the time to understand and respect the boundaries of others.  I think this is especially important as they navigate their teenage years.

Last night while she to a 30 minute bath he called her 7 times and sent her over 30 texts that started with him just saying ""Babe, call me"" and culminated in him saying there would be consequences for her ignoring him.  It was the last straw, and she told him she was done.  He then blew up her phone until she blocked him and removed him from all of her social media.  He then started contacting all of the people in their shared group of friends, trying to get them to talk her into giving him another chance.  She.  Is.  Done.

As a mom, I would want to know if my son (13M) was treating someone like this.  I recognize that this is a learning experience for both of them, and hope that this boy can learn to have healthier relationships on the future.  WIBTA for contacting his mom and letting her know everything that has been going on?  We have chatted in the past, and I have her contact info, so it would be easy to get in touch with her.  Or would I be overstepping my bounds by getting involved, since at this point my daughter seems to have done a good job of handling things on her own?

&#x200B;

UPDATE:  I talked with my daughter tonight and told her that I was considering calling his mom to discuss his behavior.  (For the record, I would have done this even without all of the suggestions to do so.  I respect her enough to keep her in the loop.)  I explained that I don't think she could have handled the situation any better than she did, and I am so proud of her for advocating for herself and her boundaries.  But I have concerns about the way he continues to stomp those boundaries and try to manipulate her.  I am also concerned about his future relationships if he doesn't make some serious changes, which probably won't happen without some intervention.

She was not upset at all and said she understood why I would want to call his mom.  She asked that I wait a couple of days to see if he stops the behaviors on his own.  We agreed that if he is still trying to call and text her and her friends by Friday, I will make the call.  As a side note, the friends he has contacted have all told him that he needs to give her space and understand why she broke up with him.  She is lucky to really have a great group of friends.  

&#x200B;

Also, for those of you who have asked... From a very early age we have always emphasized the importance of boundaries with our kids.  We never forbid them from being friends with kids we saw as potential bad influences, but focused on what makes a good friend.  When problems arose, we would talk to them and help them see when someone wasn't respecting them (or when they weren't respecting others).  So her recognizing that he was being manipulative and needy was an extension of that.  I'm so happy that years of those types of conversations worked and she has a very good grasp on what health interactions look like!",AmItheAsshole
AITA for refusing to meet my wife's ex-boyfriend?,"My wife stays in contact with her ex who she dated for 5 years before meeting me. All they do is text each other occasionally, which I have no problem with. I explained to her early on that I am not interested in ever meeting or befriending any of her exes. She agreed and it was never an issue until now.

Her ex has moved back to the city where we live and she really wants him and I to meet. Once again I explained to her that I have zero interest in such a meeting. I see no point to it, I don't need his blessing or approval, and I have enough friends. Plus the whole idea just seems awkward. 

She explained that it would mean a lot to her if I would just meet with him. I asked why and her response was that it will keep his mind at ease knowing that she is with someone good. I snapped a little but didn't raise my voice and asked her: *""Since when does his wants and concerns matter in our marriage?""* 

She didn't have answer for this and simply asked me to think about it. I know my answer is not going to change and I am honestly quite angry about this whole thing. AITA? Also any advice is much appreciated.

Thank you.

**P.S**

I don't care if they meet occasionally to catch up, but I think I'll be getting a divorce if they start hanging out on the regular. I love my wife but I don't think I have her heart. He was her longest relationship aside from me and she lost her virginity to him.

**EDIT**

With regards to divorcing her over this:

> I'd rather divorce her than control her. I didn't tell her that I would do this, it will simply happen. I can control what I do (not meeting him), but I cannot control what she does. It would be better to part ways instead of turning the marriage into a toxic swamp.",AmItheAsshole
[UPDATE] Coworker is bragging about filing a false bite report to attempt to have their ex's dog euthanized. Can I help prevent this?,"[Link to first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/c34jp2/coworker_is_bragging_about_filing_a_false_bite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

Glad to say I've got a happy update!

The coworker was indeed terminated the day her probationary period ended (7/1). I wasn't working that day but apparently she just stormed out wordlessly when told. 

The ex has filed for a temporary restraining order and is working on a permanent one. He's also installed home security cameras and carries a copy of the police report and a one page vet record showing the dog is spayed and vaccinated. The dog has also been to obedience school and they wrote a letter saying she hasn't shown any human or dog aggression. 

Police and animal control are very good around here. They assured us both that euthanasia is an absolute last resort in any case  and that they'd require extra proof from this coworker should she report anything. Additionally, with the restraining order, the coworker can't be ""bitten"" by the dog without violating it. And the department says they don't allow totally anonymous reporting-you can keep your name secret from the dog's owner but not the police/animal control. 

So the dog is safe, coworker let go, and ex is forewarned and forearmed. I'd call it a win!

"I [31m] found text messages from my gf [26f] of 3 years to another man including ""I love you"". Should I kick her out?","So this happened a week or two before Christmas. We work opposite schedules so one of us can be at home with our kid at all times. She works weekends (and the occasional week night) at a local children's hospital and I work 9-5 weekdays. 

I had recently grown suspicious of her ""friendship"" with this guy she would bring over for play dates because he also has a young daughter. They were texting a lot and making plans to hang out together more and more frequently. 

One Monday night when she had to work I decided to snoop. I logged into her iMessages on the kids iPad and immediately saw that they were regularly texting. She was not texting me at the time but she was texting him, and very flirtatiously. Kissy faces. Heart emojis. All that. Stuff she used to do with me! I kept my cool and kept watching to see how far this actually went. At first I was in shock and couldn't believe that was actually happening.

By the end of the night I saw it. They exchanged ""I love yous"" and they spoke of each other as their ""missing puzzle piece"" while making future plans to hang out together, alone. I still have all the text screenshots saved.

The next morning I brought it up to her and in my anger told her to move out. She claims that she didn't mean it and she was going to ""break it off"" with him after Christmas but I find that hard to believe. She also claims they didn't sleep together but they had hung out together multiple times before without me so who knows. She even bought tickets for them to go to a hockey game together! Plus I don't know what she's doing at home when I'm at work all week. 

Part of me wants to believe her and let it go because we have a kid together and it was supposedly just ""meaningless words"" but shouldn't she have thought about before she decided to have an emotional affair with another man? She hid it from me so she obviously knew what she was doing was wrong.

The house and bills are in my name because we are not married so she has no legal right to stay here as far as I know (I have consulted with a lawyer already).

Am I blowing this all out of proportion or is forcing her to move out the right thing to do despite how hard it may be?",relationship_advice

UPDATE: I (19F) had a summer fling with an older guy (26M). I took a pregnancy test today and it came out positive,"Edit: Wow! Thank you so much for my first gold, kind stranger! That's really sweet. Hugs! <3

Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/901lyn/i_19f_had_a_summer_fling_with_an_older_guy_26m_i/

First of all, thank you all so so much for the overwhelming support. I never imagined that I would get this amount of positive support and advice for my situation. When I posted, I was in a pretty bad place (I think I typed the post out on my bathroom floor where I had been crying). Thank you all for the reassurance and comfort. Also, thank you so much to all the girls that shared their personal experiences. I read every single comment (good and bad) and tried to respond to all of them. I appreciate all of you guys so much and it honeslty helped me cope a lot. 

Special thank you to u/Janaya59, your comment was the turning point for me. I got myself up from the bathroom floor, took a shower, opened a bucket of ice cream and calmed down for the rest of the night. 

About two days after I posted, I told one of my best friends about my positive pregancy test. He was completely supportive and reassured me that all was going to be okay. He drove me to my doctor's appointment and sat in the doc's office while I peed in a cup and got my blood drawn. I was positive for hCG so the pregnancy was real. I was about five weeks. He held me as I cried and on the way back, bought take-out for the both of us. 

That day, I called a local clinic, scheduled my appointment for Wednesday. I was early enough to take Mifeprex (the pill). On Tuesday, my best friend (the one that I mentioned in my original post) finally came back from Africa and I told her immediately. She hugged me close and I cried some more (the waterworks were very common during that whole week) and she cried for me as well. 

On the day of my appointment, both of my best friends came with me. I took Mifeprex at the clinic and got the misoprostol to take at home. Right after I took the Mifeprex, I felt complete and utter relief. It felt better than the day I finished all of my college applications. All of my stress instantly dissipated. I knew I was going to be okay and that I had my life back on track. My friends drove me back and we all hung out at my dorm and ate ice cream. I'm so lucky to have friends like them in my life and I'm so thankful for them.

So yes, I had the abortion and I feel completely relieved.

One thing that I did do that I said I probably wasn't was that I told ""Nick"". I was completely set on not telling him since we were never in a relationship (we had a summer fling) and we hadn't seen each other in like a month. But I hate keeping secrets, especially when it comes to myself, and I thought that if I do end up getting a position at the lab, I would see him everyday. It would be very difficult for me to see him and know that I kept this from him when he played somewhat of a role in it too. He's also someone that never gave me any red flags and I was also 99% sure that he was going to be in support of an abortion. So I texted him the day after I made my appointment asking him to meet up for coffee. I told him, managed not to break out in tears, and then told him I already schdued the abortion. He was completely shocked, thanked me for telling him then got up and hugged me. He said he absolutely supported my decision and thanked me for choosing it. He then got up and hugged me again. He offered to come with me and pay for the pill and I told him no and no but thanked him for his offer and support. He told me to call him if anything came up or if I needed anything. I nodded, and then asked him if he could not say anything about all of this and he wholeheartedly said absolutely. And that was that. 

I could tell he was relieved and I expected it since he's a talented and successful med student who doesn't even have time to take care of himself, nonetheless a pregnant girl and a baby. 

In all, I made the right choice and had an amazing support system. Thank you especially to Reddit since you guys gave me unconditional support while I was at my lowest. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. 

TL;DR: Got the abortion and told Nick about it. I feel like a complete planet has been lifted off of my shoulders. Life's good and back on track.

I told her I wanted her to starting paying for her phone, the electric, and the internet.  Combined usually around $175.   

I didn't bring up her attitude from last night, but right away she knew what that was.  She said I was being stupid, petty, a bitch, and some other things that I can't really remember atm.  She said she wasn't going to pay it so I told her that if she doesn't the next time those bills come around she can find a new place to live.   More insults before she stormed out.

Gf and I live together.   She only works part time.    I pay all the rent and bill.  I never minded it until last night. 

We went to grab some take out and I realized I left my wallet in my work pants.  I told her she'd have to get it.   Her attitude about the whole thing was so ugly.   At first she couldn't believe it and asked me if I was serious in this almost disgusted tone.  She acted so put out by it. 

It was some fucking take out.  Under $40.  I pay EVERYTHING.  I understand she only makes a little, but that little is probably a lot with no expenses.   I know it was only one incident, but I haven't been able to get it out of my head since.   It's really rubbing my the wrong way.  She wouldn't be able to pay a lot of the bills, but I feel like it's time for her to start carrying her weight.  Just out of principal.

TIFU by accidentally emailing everybody in my dept a chapter of my pornographic Harry Potter fanfiction.,"This happened 2 hours ago.

I was emailing a .txt containing the latest installment of my fanfiction to myself because I'd written it on my laptop and I wanted to edit it on my desktop.

But I typed in my work email by accident. It's extremely similar to my personal email, but my work email automatically forwards every incoming message to everyone in my department. Didn't even think about it.

I've never actually gotten physically sick because of a mistake before. The panic has died down a little. I've begun to accept that this is my life now.

It's not even tame porn you guys.

I'm going to resign tomorrow, early in the morning, by means of a letter; leave my keys to the building in the envelope; and go back to get a different degree. I've been thinking about doing it for a while. Guess I don't really have a choice now.

**TL;DR:** Sent a chapter of my Harry Potter porn to my coworkers earlier today. Going to resign in disgrace tomorrow.

---

**EDIT:** Thank you guys for all the advice and reassurance you've offered. You have no idea how much I needed it. I feel a little more human now, but this thread has gotten away from me. 

I still plan on resigning. I liked my job, but my boss will hear about this one way or another and as much as I appreciate all of the lies you've suggested, I honestly can't lie to her. I'm a shitty shitty liar and she's a very sharp woman. I won't get fired, she'd never pay unemployment as long as she lived, but I can't hope to move up in this particular company after something like this, and my life could get very difficult where I'm at.

I intend to go back to school. It's what I've been wanting to do for a long time, but I never had the courage to move forward with it. Fortunately the nearby college has a good nursing program and I'm taking steps to register for Fall.

Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to go lie in bed and stare at the ceiling.

---

**LAST EDIT:** I know there might be at most 3 people who see this but I felt the need to update. It's very anticlimactic.

I calmed down before going into work Monday and decided not to resign right off the bat. I just walked in like everything was normal and tried not to look at anyone. I sent out an email stating that my personal account had been compromised, and to please delete any messages from my personal account, as they may contain viruses. I felt like a dumbass trying to lie, but nobody approached me or acted strangely all day. My boss didn't even speak to me.

These last few days have been the same. Maybe they read it, maybe they didn't, I have no clue. My guess is ""no"" but that might just be wishful thinking. Either way, my life is going on somehow - but I'm definitely never going to email myself porn again.

And for those of you who were curious, it was a HG x LM fic set 5 years after the last book, so no, there was no cp or any other kind of nonsense going on, just regular ol sex between adults, although one is much older than the other. So don't worry. The children are safe.",tifu

WIBTA if I (f28) got steralised against my fianc√©'s wishes?,"My fiance (31m) and I (28f) have two girls aged 4&2. Last year I had a stillborn baby daughter. I said I never wanted to be pregnant again. It hit me really hard and I've never known pain like it. 

Apparently, your super fertile after a loss and I ended up falling pregnant immediately after our loss and I'm currently 8 month pregnant with a boy. Something my fiance really wanted.

I hate being pregnant. Never enjoyed it. I hate even more how long I've been pregnant due to the back to back pregnancies. I'm miserable and I never want to be pregnant again.

In the unlikely event the baby I'm carrying now does also die I never want to be pregnant again. If the baby lives I never want to be pregnant again. I honestly can't explain how much I hate being pregnant. I love babies, children etc. Not pregnancy. My eldest two girls and this baby are all c sections which is tough. I gave up work to be a sahm but I'm looking forward to when this one starts school and I can get back to work.
I hate how sick, tired and achey I feel. I'm short tempered with my other children. I'm fat and saggy. I poop constantly. My mental healths taken a complete beating - I've been in counselling for nearly a year now and feeling better though. 

Anyway. My consultant offerered to cut my fallopian tubes during my next c section making me infertile. I said yes of course, just check with my fiance.
He is very against it. I don't feel comfortable doing something permanent that effects him too without his support but equilly ill never forgive him if I fall pregnant again. 

He says I'm making a decision based on anger that's I've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.

WIBTA if I agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what I want?

Also to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.

Edit: this has gotten more attention than I thought it would. I haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.
Just to answer a few questions that have come up so far. I wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. 

Fiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. I always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. We had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.

This past year he's been my absolute rock. He also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while I fell apart. He's a fantastic father. This isn't a walk away from our family matter.

He's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and I accept that. He has so many other fantastic qualities. An example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. He simply refused to pick. It upset him too much. You could say this is an ass hole move, however while I sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.

I know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but I didn't want relationship advice. I just wanted to know if I would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.

If I say I'm getting it done, he won't stop me. But he will resent me. If I don't get it done, I will resent him. 

His main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. Second that I'm not my usual self (I'm not - I am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however I have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). Third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. Forth is my age. 

And I've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. Our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. I have my third c section booked for the end of the month. I need to give an answer on Wednesday if I want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. I wanted to see if I was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. 
So far it seems from comments that I'm not and I really appreciate all the replies. I will read them all xxx

Edit 2. Guys I was asking if I would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and I'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. I'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. We love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. Whilst I'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. Everything he does is for us. He's hardworking, loving and fun. He helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. He does baths and the park. He rubs my back, sends me off for baths when I ache. Let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.
Leaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. We survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. We can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x",AmItheAsshole

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r12hs/pa_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and_threatens_to


My post was not hugely popular, but I have a small update. Thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, I read all of them, even the ones I didn't reply to immediately.

I called the police last night. An officer came out to my house, he read the messages, saw the photos, and said, ""Yeah that's illegal and I don't think it gets much easier to prosecute than this."" He had my fiance send him screenshots of everything and then the photos separately. He took my ex's information, our information, and the surprisingly ample amount of information I have on his girlfriend. 

My ex is currently on both probation and parole, so the officer is reaching out to his PO today for a current address since he refused to provide it to me. He'll be calling my ex today, and if he hangs up on him or gets smart, he'll be prepared with an address to just go talk to him. He also knows where he is working this evening while the officer is on duty, so that is a last resort.

He is also going to run the evidence and our statements by the DA's office today and get the green light to proceed with charges, which apparently will include an actual arrest once everything that needs to happen happens. I'm not clear on the details exactly, I just know that they are almost certainly going to be charging him with a misdemeanor 2. 

Additionally, I am almost positive that my ex's current girlfriend, who he has been with for roughly 9 months now, was involved in some manner. She is an RN, so if it comes to light that she was complicit, she could also be charged and lose her job. I don't know how it would impact her license as an RN, but I did work for the hospital she works for currently, and any charges, no matter how minor, result in termination. The officer confirmed this, as well. 

And I took everyone's advice - I contacted my attorney. He is drafting a cease and desist letter to send to both my ex and his current partner. He is also going to request a copy of the police report to add to the already massive stack of evidence of reasons why he should not get custody of either of his kids, he should remain strictly on visitation, if he's lucky enough to even get that.

Thank you everyone, I have a small amount of hope that this will work out favorably. My current partner doesn't care what he has to say or what pictures he sends, he sees it every day. He also knows that my ex is vindictive and is grasping at straws in an adult temper tantrum. Hopefully this will end the years of this crap from my ex, as this is not the first partner he has done this with. It's just finally a charge in PA!",legaladvice

TIFU GIVING MY 17 YR OLD NEPHEW ADVICE ON HOW TO MEET WOMEN.,"A few weeks ago I flew out to Fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since I havent seen them in 4 years. The first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. They gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. The conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. The older son ,""Alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at HS and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. On the other hand is my nephew ""Dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. When I pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. Alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and Dan. Being the cool uncle I let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. As she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my Marine Corps days. If he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. But dont go empty handed. I suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. Now that I think of it I was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. So the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 A few days later it occured to all of us Dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. When his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. I however was not buying it. I pulled him aside and got the truth. The boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. He would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. He met a girl and they had been seeing each other. I was happy I could help and could not believe it actually worked. However things went south. 
 A few days after my return to the east coast I received a very emotional call from my sister. She explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""Have you seen this man"" flier on the door. It was a grainy surveillance photo of Dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. The flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. When she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. Now Dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and I told I am not invited for Christmas. Poor Dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

TL;DR.  I royally fucked up by telling my 17 year old nephew to meet big girls by hanging out in front of womens plus sized stores with food causing him to be forever grounded and causing  possible restraining orders, as well as me no longer invited to my sisters.",tifu
Animation is the superior format and live-action adaptations are always a mistake,"The two easy ""exceptions"" are Bumblebee which was pretty decent and Beauty and the Beast (nearly a frame for frame remake so not terrible, but certainly not as good as the original).

But generally speaking live action versions of children's books (Cat in the Hat, Grinch), cartoons (Flintstones, Scooby Doo), and comics (Garfield, Dennis the Meanace, Casper) are a shit-show. They haven't ever gotten it right because you really can't get it right. The only reason Bumblebee is an exception is the quality of the animation which is to say it was good only as much as it was animated.

Bottom line, real actors can't compete with animations and we should stop trying.",unpopularopinion

AITA for skipping my child's birth to see my dying father?,"I had to make the hardest decision of my life a week ago and i want some AITA judgment to see if i made the right decision so please don't remove and say it needs to go tinto another subreddit cuz i'll post there too

&#x200B;

My wife went into labor a few weeks earlier then expected and she ended up giving birth at the hospital. The day it happened she told me that she was in the hospital and needed me however i had just left the house an half hour prior to go see my father who was likely about to die (he did a few hours after i arrived). I decided to see my father one last time and i felt like it was more important than seeing my child's birth because i will raise him and see him everyday for the next 18+ years and i really need to say some things to my father before he dies. My wife and the rest of her family are fucking pissed at me and said that birth is one of the most important parts of our lives and i needed to be there to support my wife and see the child. Obviously i didn't want this shit to happen but i felt seeing my father for the last time was important especially since i hadn't seen him in weeks and we weren't on good terms then which we eventually resolved thankfully. If you'd like to provide any advice you're welcome to as i could use some but I'm mainly here for judgment

"Jack, a renown atheist, dies...","... and to his utter surprise ends up in hell where he's greeted by Satan himself.

Completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""Welp, I've been wrong all my life and I guess I'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

Satan laughs and replies: ""Awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

He then proceeds to escort Jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

As they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize Satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

Every time they stop to a house Satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

At sunset the devil sees that Jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

As they walk to Jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and Jack asks: ""What's behind there?""

Satan: ""Oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

Despite his curiosity Jack thought better not to bother Satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where Satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

That night however Jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

After a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that Satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

Once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

Jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

On the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

Jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the Devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

The following morning Satan showed up once again and told Jack to come with him.

Jack pleaded: ""PLEASE! PLEASE! Don't take me to hell, I'll do anything just let me stay here, I don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

Satan: ""What are you talking about??? I'm just gonna show you the recreational center like I told you yesterday""

Jack: ""Don't lie to me, I saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

Satan: ""Ooooh you saw that! Don't worry  that's not for you, that's the Christian hell""

Jack: ""The christian hell? Why would the christian hell be like that?""

Satan: ""I don't know either man, they just want it that way""

"AITA for keeping my marriage and child a secret from my mother, as well as refusing to let her see my son?","The secrecy started early. I am a gay woman. At 15 when I came out, my mom simply disagreed. She told me I wasn't gay. She said I was jealous. That these girls looked better than me and I was jealous of them, not attracted to them. She genuinely thinks it's impossible for me to be gay and never took it seriously. It got to a point where I didn't tell her if I met anyone.

Skip to when I met my wife. When I'd finally let my mom know about her(we had been together two years now) the convo went like this:

Me: we want to get married.
Her, extremely disdainful: oh you do? Well let me tell you something, throwawaygayallday, you're going to want a man. Your car breaks down, you're screwed. You need heavy stuff moved? Screwed. Two women can't make love. You're going to want a man in bed with you.

I hung up on her, I was so fucking mad. I married my wife without telling my parents.

I never told my mom we wanted a child and never told her of his birth. When I visited for Christmas, I went alone. I'm not sure when I planned to tell her or how. I just hadn't gotten around to doing it. Serious procrastination and dread.

My wife and I live a few hours from my parents. They've never visited(they don't know my address) and when we spend time together, I go to them. They do pass through on the way to visit other family though. They had stopped at our Wal-Mart to get last-minute items and that's when they saw us.

I was there getting stuff for dinner and had my son in the cart seat. We were going down an aisle when I heard ""Hey kiddo!"" from behind. I recognized my mom's voice and turned to face her, ready to do introductions. But damn man, the instant she saw my son, she gave him the dirtiest fucking look and said ""Whose kid?""

Me, now pissed: Mine
Her: what do you mean he's yours?
Me: I mean he's mine
Her: he can't be yours
Me: ever heard of IVF?
Her: So you went and spent god knows how much money to have a kid with your girlfriend
Me: Wife
Her: And when were you going to tell me about all this?
Me: I don't know, I don't want to talk about it in the middle of the store

I walked away and checked out, her following, still talking shit.

I put my son and food in the car and left. My mom called later. I tried to talk to her. I apologized for the secrecy, said she gets condescending when we talk about these things. She denied this. She then went on about how I didn't invite her to the wedding, that she'll never get that moment back and see me get married(which I do feel bad about).

She eventually asked when I would bring my son over. I said never. I said I wasn't going to bring him there when she's so negative toward us. I said she doesn't respect me or my family so she doesn't deserve to know my family. Hung up on her and haven't answered her calls or texts. She has apologized for speaking to me the way she has but I don't care at this point. I'm too fucking mad. AITA for not inviting her to the wedding and not allowing her to see my son?

Some clarification about my opinion. No I am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

Geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. And now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. So stop saying, hey I'm from Norway and I don't want to adopt an African child. Your country have zero orphanage?
It's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from African countries.

No I'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
I'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
But if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

And someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
Your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. This cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

TIFU by buying a house that wasn't attached to the sewer and discovering this fact while crawling through my own plops [NSFW],"Obligatory this was a while ago.

So it's a known fact amongst friends and family that I always have a poop or fart joke waiting to go. It's just who I am. You can have your turgid penis and voluptuous vagina jokes, I'll take a heaving helping of poop jokes with a squelching mound of fart stories any day of the week. If you've shat your pants in public I want to know, the more public and embarrassing the better, it's not a sex thing I swear; I've just always been like that since I was a young child. There is something inherently humorous to a subject so personal and private and that will never change. 

That knowledge combined with the events I am about to relay to you make me wonder if perhaps we do live in a world where unseen forces act to maximize the comedic value of my life.

Some don't believe me when I tell them this tale but there's a link at the end with video evidence so suspend your disbelief and prepare to be grateful for your moderate home repair issues, it could be far worse.
Here we go.

My wife and I bought the house with a few minor problems that were handled during closing like all deals are, we knew there would be a few surprises from what friends and family said so we stashed some money aside and opened a Home Depot card for the promotional no interest purchases. 

Sure enough the floor wasn't insulted in the downstairs and since the crawlspace was hard to get around in to the inspector never caught it. I went ahead and purchased a load of insulation to re-insulate, whatever. It was summer and after getting married a few months earlier then moving we were exhausted so we worked on the interior of the house and the yard for the remainder of the good weather.

During this time we'd get the occasional whiff of something stanky but didn't think much of it. I'd buy some Draino and the smell would go away. Ok, the house has some plumbing issues, no biggie, $7 a week until we got the rest of the home under control and we'd get a plumber in to take look.
It's the week before Thanksgiving and I finally get under the house to work on that insulation. It's cooler and everything is drying out for the winter. 

I've been in some crawl spaces that would gross the average human out before but this place, Jesus fucking Christ this place took the cake, blew a load all over it, force-fed it to a drugged out former child actor then bottled the shit they produced for resale at the local farmer's market as a skin care product it was so evil. I knew right then we were in for a ride, the house had been flipped and if it wasn't visible during a tour it had not been fixed.

That week I found 2 dead cats, an old stereo system from the 80s that had been hulk smashed, a car wheel, a broken window for a bar from New Hampshire (we're in New York) and so much insulation it took fifteen extra large trash bags to remove among other random debris. Even with a respirator my nose still get clogged and I spend the remainder of the day with no sense of smell.

Anyone who knows anything about homes will tell you when someone flips a house they tend to buy shitholes and plug them with some spackel to keep the streams of festering shit at bay before selling them to unsuspecting dupes like us. 

If you're buying a home that's been flipped negotiate like you're fucking the shit out of a fresh coconut that will be thrown away immediately like any normal person would because I guarantee you that those sellers have been hiding cum filled coconuts in the walls just waiting for you to find as you settle in and attempt to make changes to the home. They don't give a fuck if the place falls apart next year because the reality of real estate law is it's buyer beware. They deserve to make as little as fucking possible for their ""trouble"" so go in fucking if you want to come out satisfied. Then again I'm biased as you will come to find out.

So I'm under the house two days before Thanksgiving and hauling bags of old insulation out through a tiny hole I can barely fit through. My wife tells me she's going to take a shower and won't be able to help if I need anything. I crawl back under and figure I'll grab another bag or two and call it quits.

Then I hear the water. If you're a homeowner the worst sound you can hear is water running where it shouldn't be. That's better than never hearing the water but it still means there's a lot of water where it shouldn't be any and if you don't find it things get messy fast.I didn't know much but I knew that.

I hear a splattering that is roughly equivalent of a shower running but it sounds like water is pouring into a pool. I've owned a home for less than 4 months at this point so everything makes me nervous but this struck fear in my heart. It's even coming from the corner of the crawlspace the inspector couldn't get to because of ductwork making this urgent andsuper inconvenient.

I'm about 100 pounds lighter than the inspector so I squirm my way over the main sewer line and over the field of nasty old insulation that would still take another ten bags to remove. Clouds of fiberglass cat piss dust are billowing and making it hard to see through my respirator. I wriggle under the main return air duct just barely making, something shifts and the fucker slides about 3 inches closer to the ground making a return from this side of the crawlsapce impossible. I sigh and keep going. My nose is always clogged from the moment I get down there, something about that dust just immediately makes it impossible for me to smell anything for a good couple of hours even though I make sure the respirator fits snugly against my face.

The light of my headlamp illuminates the problem, there's a stream of water pouring from somewhere between the joists. I think to myself ""Great! The pipe broke?!"" and crawl forward to the sparkling stream. I climb over a mound and down the other side onto what I thought was dirt but the moment I touched it the layer of dirt on the water rippled with the water beneath it. I see the brown ripples spreading but it's too late and the cool water floods into my gloves, moments later I realize my entire torso is wet as the water soaks through my jumpsuit. ""What the fuck!?"" this is more than a single shower. This is, like a month of showers in a dusty lake under our house. The water stops running and I decide it's time to just get out of the crawlspace and call the plumber. We put away money specifically for stuff like this, it won't be fun but whatever.

I'm moister than an oyster at this point and take a soggy second to look over the tangle of pipes and mountains of dirt - weird the floor should be flat but whatever - searching for a path to where there's a space behind the furnace I'll be able to slide through. I see it and start slogging through the sludgy mud trying to figure out what it's going to cost to drain this water so the plumber can work. 

The I hear it. A toilet flush. It didn't hit me until it hit me, the better part of a flush splattered across my back unleashing a sub-human scream of disgust and outrage. I turned back to try to see where it's coming from and respirator caught on a random old pipe sticking out of the ground sliding to the side. 

A whiff of unadulterated corruption made it to my clogged crawlspace dust filled sinuses. Jesus, Buddha, Sagan, anyone with temporal admin rights wind this horror story back and get me out of here. Send me back to the womb, let me start over, I want to start over; we have to go back, Kate!
I'm sure you're thinking ""Why the fuck would my wife shit after showering?"" I thought same thing, to be honest I don't know, she married me; I livestream jars of meat for my own personal entertainment, I guess she's going to be a little off, too.

The realization of how far up shit's creek I am soaked into my brain at the same speed of that which soaked into my back. The upstairs bathroom wasn't on the tax documents prior to the seller's ownership, it was part of the renovation. Someone fucked up bigly and since the house wasn't occupied after the renovation this is only now coming to light. Holy shit I'm crawling through three months of shit, my shit, my wife's shit, my father in law's shit! 

Memories of every shit I'd taken since moving in coursed through a mind imploding with revulsion like some nightmarish montage complete with the disembodied image of some arch nemesis cackling in the corner of the vision. We had numerous taco nights, I had discovered a sale on discount hot dogs a month earlier and had an entirely unrelated case of food poisoning a week after that was so bad I was showering instead of wiping. All of that was down here, with me, on me, soaking into me.

The panic set in and I scrambled up and over the mound that when it broke under my frantic grasping revealed yet-to-decompose toilet paper and slimy fecal matter complete with a visible kernel of corn, the metaphorical cherry on top of this unholy shit-cake that I was scrambling through.

Five minutes later my wife comes downstairs and finds me in the downstairs shower, which was also not attached to the sewer, crying hysterically, the stress of finding one thing after another leading up to me crawling through my own waste had been too much. I could only hope that in time the stains burned into my memory would fade.

Today we joke about it because what the fuck else can you do? We had it fixed, we moved on. We still can't believe we never smelled it bad enough to think more than a backed up drain. We started taking classes on how to repair your own home and are learning as much about basic home repair as we can. We are wiser and more capable today, this kind of disaster won't happen again.

To answer your questions yes we had an inspector and no New York State does not hold inspectors liable for anything but after several other far more expensive issues and discovery of discrepancies in the sale documents an attorney has taken the case.

TL;DR I bought a house where the sellers had not attached the pipes to the sewer and the crawlspace prevented the inspector from catching it. I learned about this 3 months after the sale while crawling through the puddle of poops. ",tifu

Ive seen reps say the ISP modem rental was required, thats pushy sales tactics -most of the time. Just tell them emphatically you want to buy your own. **The router/modem model is important, make sure you ask your ISP what model/combo to buy**

Techs are no cost when its first installed because its the outside lines, into your house. The same goes for internet issues. You again, emphatically tell customer care that the issue is not with the hardware but with the wiring outside/to your box. They are pushy, like the car repair business.

"What ""black market"" did kids at your school run?",,AskReddit
[Update] My father got my 14 year old sister pregnant.,"A lot has happened since I posted.

I talked with my sister for a long time over the next week and she eventually agreed to talking to an adult at school. I went with her to talk to a teacher she was close with. After a lot of crying together she called the police and our school counselor and principal. They basically didn't let us go home that day from school. 

We ended up getting a case worker and parents of my sister's best friend (NOT the mom who was constantly harassing us about going public) took us in temporarily. We are currently still with them. 

The police visited my dad who won't admit to raping me or my sister, but they found a ton of child porn on his computer and other things they wouldn't tell us about. He has been arrested for the child porn. Unfortunately, that did make the news and everyone knows. It's extremely embarrassing and stressful to have people judge you all the time. People wouldn't shut up about it for like two weeks. 

My sister moved to a different school that helps with troubled kids and special situations for while she is pregnant. We are hoping she can go back after she has the baby and continue at her first school... Ideally.. 

She and I both have gone through a lot of counseling and she is okay giving up the child for adoption now. Our case worker and counselor are both really great about this whole thing.  Mom is still not in the picture.

I fully plan on changing my name to my mom's maiden name and so does my sister. My case worker says that's completely possible for us to do. Thanks for that advice reddit, I got that from here. 

Anyway, thanks for the advice. It helped me talk her into how serious it was.

AITA for buying the dress that my friend wanted but couldn't get because they don't have it in plus size?,"I and my friends are going to be bridesmaids in our friend's wedding, and for the past few weeks we've been searching online for bridesmaids dresses and sharing links of dresses we like in our group chat so none of us ends up buying the same or very similar dresses. My friend Ana sent a link for a green bateau dress and literally said ""I love this but they don't have it in my size."" (She is US 14.)

I agreed that the dress is beautiful while one of our other friends said that the skirt might be too wide for a bridesmaid dress. Ana went on to send more links of other dresses and our group's conversation moved along. 

Yesterday Ana sent a message in our chat that she just ordered one of the dresses she showed us, and asked if we already chose a dress. I really liked the green bateau dress so I checked if they had it in my size (I am US 8) and they did so I told our group that I was going to order the bateau dress. No one replied immediately, but I didn't think too much about it because it's not uncommon for me and my friends to take a while before replying, specially during work hours. I ordered the dress.

A few hours later I got a call from one of my friends saying that Ana called her and was upset that I ordered the bateau dress, knowing she liked it but couldn't buy it because it wasn't available in her size. My friend said Ana thinks I'm trying to make her feel bad about her weight by flaunting that I can wear the dress she likes because I'm skinnier. 

To be honest I have mixed emotions about what Ana said, but trying to fix things comes first so I tried calling Ana and sending her messages to apologize, explaining that I didn't intend for her to feel that way. But she hasn't answered my calls or messages. 

So I just want to know: AITA for thinking that there is nothing wrong with buying the dress Ana liked but couldn't buy because they didn't have it in her size in the first place, or is my friend overreacting?",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by letting my girlfriend touch my element and mineral collection,"Yea yea what a nerd, he collects the periodic table.

Well I do, it's not the largest but contains some of the more interesting or rare elements. It sits in a display case in my room, and looks like this
https://imgur.com/a/DRj8sjr

So the fuck up begins when I order the element Cobalt. It has to ship from Italy where I get the elements + jars, and it arrived broken.
I emailed them, and they responded [in a very wholesome and google translated email](https://i.imgur.com/V5vODvy.jpg) saying they would replace the jar. 

So the jar arrives and I transfer the cobalt sample from some other storage container into it's designated jar. Everyone would be fine if it stays in the jar. My girlfriend is at my house at the time, and I hand it to her to put in the display case, which she spends a while at.

 I assume she's looking at some of the cooler samples like gold, platinum, or gallium,  I think nothing of it. Later on her hand gets really red and itchy. Like reeallly bad. It looks like she stuck her hand into poison ivy.
She's in a lot of irritation and some pain and I think I know the cause.

""Did you take the cobalt out of its jar""

""Yea I held it and looked at it""

I know she did more than that, probably shook it around in her hand or something.
For those of you who don't know, cobalt has an effect called ""contact dermatitis"" which basically means, you touch it, and it makes you really uncomfortable. Once you have one reaction, you'll most likely develop a lifelong allergy. Cobalt also known to cause cancer, but only with frequent contact. 

So now her hand was feeling a bit better but it looked terrible. There wasn't much anyone could do, so that sucks for her.
I had to deal with the fact that I handed her a very toxic metal and didn't tell her. Yay for me. Major fuck up and I'm an idiot. 

TL;DR I handed my girlfriend a toxic metal and she touched it causing a painful reaction and probably gave her a lifelong allergy to it. Oh and the metal also causes cancer.

*Edit:* Ok also I want to to throw this in there, that this probably won't be that much of a problem. She doesn't want to study chemistry, and how many times in your life will you come into contact with elemental cobalt? Yea, zero. It would have to be pure elemental cobalt, not alloys. She wasn't mad about it either, we laugh about it.

Edit 2: I need to be more specific about the allergy. Everyone will have a reaction to cobalt. We are all allergic. But after your first serious exposure, you're significantly more sensitive to it. I didn't really _give_ her an allergy, I just made her more vulnerable to cobalt. Also, don't blame her. This is my fault and I should have been more clear. She is a smart person and it's not her fault. This is TIFU not ""Today someone else fucked up""

Edit 3: so more people are expressing interest in element collecting rather than in expressing sympathy for my poor girlfriend. I created a sub, r/CollectingElements to start you people up. In case you were curious, here are my current elements and the _cursed cobalt_

"AITA for telling my daughter her ""child"" is not really my ""grandchild""?","My daughter (28) has gotten into DPS and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. She has been fostering this 8MO for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they ""sort out"" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. Although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. My daughter hopes to keep Foster Child. 

I am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when I asked to confirm the size of Bio Child, she asked me about Foster Child. I told her I didn't think to include her because she's Foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. She said all grandchildren should be included. My thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. That would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

She went off on me and hung up and I am sitting here feeling horrible. I did not mean I do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but I thought I had a clear thought process? 

AITA?

Edit: I do care about this child, I'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. I just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

Final edit: I accept judgment and I commented on the person's comment that made me realize why I am in the wrong. They were to the point and just made it a simple question and I understood. 

I feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. I did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). Maybe I should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, I apologize. 

Accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. I am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - I'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

My daughter and I called her case manager and the photo idea including FC has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting FC or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

Thanks to everyone who kindly explained to me why I was in the wrong.

Dying of a mysterious lung disease; military hospital is putting me on months-long waiting lists just to see my PCM for referrals and preventing me from going to civilian doctors.,"Title is TL;DR.

Went on a deployment to Guam and contracted something that's killed my pulmonary health: It hurts to breathe, I occasionally cough up blood either after waking up or exercising, I can't even go up a flight of stairs or walk for more than 20 minutes without turning into a dying fish gulping air. I was given an albuterol inhaler and that's it medication-wise.

Was screened for cancer and TB, both results came back negative, was unable  to get further testing done in Guam due to lack of accommodations at their hospital, am currently back in mainland US but the Navy's making it a fight to even see my primary doctor just to *get a referral* to see a cardiologist, radiologist and pulmonologist for follow-up testing. 

Every day I'm getting worse and I've been told I'm straight-up not allowed to go to a hospital or doctor outside of the military to get help, lest I face punitive measures in addition to having to pay out of pocket. 

What can I do? Who can I talk to? I've basically been told: unless you're actually on your deathbed, you're screwed. I'm trapped in endless diagnostics, recieving no actual care, operating at the speed of bureaucracy and I'm slowly dying.

EDIT: Went to the ER, complained  about the chest pain, worked like a charm. I've got a follow up appointment tomorrow and got all the referrals needed to book appointments at all the specialty clinics.

EDIT 2: I appreciate all the advice and good will. 

For the guys PMing medical advice: it's not pneumonia or bronchitis or anything acute: was screened for those as well, symptoms have been ongoing for almost a year now from onset of symptoms. It's also only a *little* blood, like  the amount you'd get from a paper cut. Still sucks and it's pretty alarming when it happens.

"AITA for very rarely/almost never wanting to go to restaurants because my girlfriend makes food that's just as good, if not better, than restaurant food?","Update [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/b7vz7m/update_aita_for_very_rarelyalmost_never_wanting/)

   I've been with my wonderful girlfriend for a few years now, and we usually get along great, aside from this current issue. You can skip to the TL;DR if the exposition is too long.

She's a self-proclaimed ""foodie"", which I honestly think is just selling herself short - she's a food genius. She can taste and smell a dish and then turn around and recreate it, or even make it better than the original. 

If you taste something and wonder, 'what's that super subtle flavor?' she'll tell you, 'it's anchovy paste/sumac/lavender/some other obscure spice that you would never think of.' When someone is cooking something and they go, 'it's missing something,' she can tell you *exactly* what it needs.

(It doesn't stop there, she knew I had *touched* a diesel truck at work one morning as soon as I walked into the house *that night* because she could somehow smell it on me. It's either really cool or really creepy, depending on the day.)

That's not it, either. She *heard about a lost family recipe* and the next week, BAM, I'm eating my grandmother's homemade sausage again for the first time in fifteen years. 

It's gotten to the point where I don't see any point in going out to eat, pretty much ever, except maybe her birthday. Even the most exotic ingredients aren't out of her reach, either, and, even though it's not about cost, I've saved up more being with her than I ever had in any other relationship. The only places we really go for date night is ramen - she can't figure out how to make the noodles, but she still tries so it's just a matter of time - and sushi.

Our anniversary was recently, and I had noticed that our local fish counter was selling sushi grade fish, along with the rolling mats and nori, so I suggested that we have homemade sushi for our anniversary dinner before going out and she upset and said, ""I'm not learning how to make sushi because then I'll *never* get a real date ever again."" We ended up going out instead.

It kinda took me by surprise that she got so mad, though. She's *lightly* mentioned wanting to go out occasionally to places like Olive Garden ""because she likes the red sauce"" or other places because she likes the food, and now that I'm thinking about it, she's gotten kinda gloomy because I've asked her to cook on date nights instead of going out more often.

She also brought up that food she cooks tastes better to me because she's tasting and smelling it while it cooks so her senses are dulled by the time it's served, but she has the most acute sense of smell/taste I've ever seen so I kinda think it's just an excuse.

I just don't think it's worth it to go out and pay restaurant food prices when we can stay home for home food prices and have food that's just as excellent.

TL;DR: So, Reddit, am I the asshole for not wanting to pay a restaurant to cook my meals because I practically have a private chef of my very own?

Edit: it's not about the financial aspect of staying home vs going out, I just thought that it was worth mentioning because it's been more of a saving than expected.

Edit 2: I'm taking her out tonight to grovel, guys. I'm also going to politely ask that, if she finds this off of Twitter, please don't smother me in my sleep for being such a dick

Edit3: no, twitter, I don't buy her flowers, thanks for rubbing it in. I buy her herbs and succulents. What flowers do I buy a woman who likes to preserve them afterward?

Also, yes, I wash the dishes

#Final Edit:

Okay guys. This will probably be my last edit. This post exploded unexpectedly and I've tried to respond to as many comments as I can, but there's just too many of you. If you've asked me a direct question and I haven't answered, I'm sorry. My inbox is a mess.

I really took everything you guys gave said to heart, and I can honestly say that I've been an ass, and it's really hurt my relationship with my girlfriend. It's honestly a surprise that she's still my girlfriend after everything.

So her mom picked up the girls and I took her out to a really nice tapas restaurant. She was very excited and seemed to enjoy herself, and I apologized for being stupid. After, we took a walk and everything seemed perfect, so I asked her to marry me.

She said no. She did it kindly, but she still said no. She said that it wasn't a no forever, but she didn't want to commit to a one sided relationship and also said she doesn't think that it's fair that our relationship happens on 'my schedule' or 'my terms'. 

I'm pretty heartbroken. I thought everything was pretty okay between us, but she thinks we should go to pre-marital (pre-engagement?) counseling and the division of labor needs to change over a serious sit down conversation.

So, Reddit, you were all right. I'm the asshole who almost lost the love of my life, and most of you were right - it wasn't over restaurants.

TIFU by attempting suicide without realizing it,"So, as I was making myself breakfast this morning, I for some reason started wondering what would happen if I touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. Being the very intelligent man I am, I of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. I instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. A small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

The worst part is, I still didn't realize what I had actually just done. I just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. As I grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that I had almost electrocuted myself.

"Girlfriend (22F) mad about my (24M) answer to scenario, what do I do?","So girlfriend and I had just finished having sex. We were laying there just cuddling and not saying anything, I was dozing off and then she randomly said ""your love for me is unconditional right?"" And I mean I say that all the time so I didn't think much of it and I said ""yes, I will love you no matter what,even if you had one eye or 12 fingers"" and it was clearly a joke. She kisses me but then says "" so if I turned into a donkey right now you would still love me?"" .... I was confused because it was such a random question and I laughed and just said ""I don't know about that, I'd love you as a pet I guess""

She sits up and says ""are you fucking serious?!"" at this point I'm completely lost. I just sat there and she says ""as a pet... that's it?"" I said ""I mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?..."" she says ""still love me like you just claimed that you did, it's funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey I would still love you unconditionally and I would not treat you like 'a pet'"" ....

I'm just confused. She was so upset that she got her clothes on and slept on the couch. What did I say? I have no idea what exactly she was upset about. Am I not looking into this deep enough?

I've got a couple requests for an update, and to be honest I could have given an update the night after it happened but I didn't want to post too much if something changed. I'm sorry for ducking out of the thread early too. I read the first 400 or so comments and wanted to respond and give information to some of the folks asking, but I didn't really have time since she found the thread. I tried to obfuscate enough details that this wouldn't happen, but it's a unique situation and it got pretty popular and I think one of her friends clued her in.  I hope no other new pet parents had to explain this thread to their SOs.

&#x200B;

Some of you were asking for specific instances of abuse, and to be honest I didn't really think she was abusing him. I just thought that the way she was interacting with him might be more suitable for another cat. Molly did wonderfully with our previous cat, but she was a different cat.

&#x200B;

My original plan was to sit down with her and try to have one more honest conversation about our cat's comfort level in this house. Something needed to be done before he turned into a nervous wreck. None of this happened sadly. She came home and had it out with me about everything from the cat to some issues with her family and circled back around to our previous cat, who she kind of accused me of killing (she had end-stage cancer and stopped eating and was having daily seizures. The vet encouraged us to put her to sleep). I'd rather not go into too much detail here, but you guys were right. Our relationship had a lot of problems and adopting our cat just made them undeniable. I know some people accused my post of validation-seeking, but honestly it's difficult to tell things are bad when you're looking at the situation from the inside. Even if it was my fault, it's obviously time for things to end.

**S'up.**

This happened last weekend. 

I went to my friend's house party wearing nothing but my panda onesie. I thought underwear would be overkill since it gets so damn hot in that thing. So, I eliminated the unnecessary layers and went commando. Oof. It was freeing. The penis was a swingin' and the balls was a breathin'. Pure cock flopping fun I tell thee. And so... off I go... with a hop and skip... and a bouncing dick. 

Cut to me and this cute girl grinding on the dance floor. Her ass was rubbing against me so fucking hard, it triggered **the boner.** Aw, fuuuck! It's gonna stick out like a sore thumb underneath this damn onesie. I literally spin her ass around so it doesn't touch my dick no more. Worst. Fucking. Mistake.¬†This girl, in the heat of the moment, rips open my onesie, exposing my bare boner for all to see. As if that wasn't bad enough, my dick *fucking flexes* right before I cover up. Folks there lost their shit. Dick jokes, drunken laughter, cat-calls & whistles, all erupted in that moment. I questioned so many life choices as I stood there, frozen and flustered as fuck. 

For the rest of that night I had to dodge a mob of wasted degenerates on a mission to rip me open. The motherfuckers called it the Panda Challenge.

To clarify, the kid who hit me in the chest was a good friend of mine. He did not intend to hurt me. We were just clowning around. The kid who bullied me would just slap me or punch me. I thought he would stop but he never did. I didn't want my brother to do anything about it because I was scared he would get hurt again. He had a Level 2 Traumatic Brain Injury from a mountain biking accident and everyone is very protective of him. To those of you who say I should have told on the kid. That is a terrible idea. That would just serve to put a bigger target on my back. Then it would have been twenty bullies hitting me every day. 

Also, I feel bad for the kid I hit. I feel like his home life isn't all that great. He is always looking for attention. I tried talking to him afterwards but he didn't want to. I did talk to his brother, though, and he was glad I punched him. 

As far as the surgey goes, I think I will do a AMA on that because I saw a lot of questions about it from people who have Pectus and are curious about the surgery.

What's an 'oh shit' moment where you realised you've been doing something the wrong way for years?,,AskReddit
My dog keeps getting attacked by an emotional support dog in our apartment.,"\[Wisconsin\] There is an 8 month old male German Shepherd that is not fixed living in our apartment building. I have a six month old Australian Shepherd. We live on the fifth floor and the GS lives about four doors down. We run into each other quite often since we live on the same floor and both use the elevator.

He has attacked my AS in the elevator twice, both times on the leash while the owner would unsuccessfully try to pull him away. He attacked him another time outdoors (the first time we discovered the GS was hostile. The worst occasion was when we went to a pet store about a block away. When we walked inside the GS was off his lease and immediately started attacking my AS. The owner did not immediately intervene. I got down to try to get between the GS and my dog and he bit my arm as well in the process. After about a twenty second struggle, the pet store owner was the one who ran over and pulled the GS off me while the owner stood there and looked confused. I took pictures after the event. I had a winter coat on so my arm just had red marks and scratches while my AS's paw was bleeding and he limped around for about five minutes.

I first spoke with the apartment building and asked their advice. They said as long as the owners were taking preventative measures, such as a muzzle, they would not intervene. I spoke with the owner of the GS after this and they agreed to get a muzzle for their GS just for on the grounds. The attacks have happened so often that I do not think they can easily control their dog. My AS is also now afraid to enter the elevator and pet store since he associates it with where hes been attacked prior, and also hides from GS's if he sees them in public.

After seeing the GS and the owner for about a week after these events, I kept noticing that they do not have any kind of muzzle still. I spoke with her today and she said that after thinking on the issue she has decided to not get the muzzle. She said that the 8 month old GS is an emotional support dog, and with a muzzle he would not be able to do his job. I suggested then maybe using a gentle leader leash, that way if he lunges the leash would close his mouth. She said she is not comfortable with that.

I do not know the logistic of ESD's but I do know they do not have the same rights as service dogs. What should I do in this situation? I feel that if I go to the apartment building at this point they will say there is nothing they can do as most people assume ESD's have the same rights as service dogs (which is not true).

&#x200B;

**EDIT:** this post got a lot of responses and I'm so thankful for it. I read all your comments. Unfortunately the post was locked before I even got off work so I didn't get to reply to all.

Stemming from the advice I got I contacted the apartment again via email so that I'd have a paper trail, I explained that she said she would not muzzle him due to him ""being a ESD"". I also provided links to local government sites stating that ESD's are not the same as service dogs, and directly asked that they intervene at this point. I am awaiting their response.

I also called the local Department of neighborhood services. I filed my case, she said they will assign someone to it who will contact me and begin the investigation into it.

In lieu of this, I then contacted the pet store where the worst attack occurred. The owner was very supportive on the idea of starting a case against them. She remembered the incident and said that I had made a purchase afterwards, so she looked up my name and found the exact time we were in the store. She said she will trim the cctv footage into a clip and email it to me.

So now I will have footage of the attack in the store, a picture of the resulting marks on my arm as well as my dogs bloody paw, and the email exchange with the apartment. I feel pretty ready to get this started now.

Thank you to everyone who came here to help. I really had no idea where to go with this. I'd just like to say that my goal is not to have their dog euthanized. I blame the owners completely for this. I'm sure with the proper training he would not be so uncontrollable. My goal is for the GS to be muzzled while he is in public, and hopefully to be removed and given to responsible owners if possible. Thanks for everyone's care and advice!

WIBTA if I called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?,"My son was born when I was only 15 years old, and I've been a single dad since I was 18. It was hard living for a long time money-wise but I always tried to do best by my son. Today I own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. He came out to me when he was 14 years old and I've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

I've been with my fianc√© now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son ‚Äì at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. My son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and I've gotten to know him really well. However my fianc√© told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. That if they found out, they would have a complete fit. This really bothered me because I refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. What is going to happen in the future? When my son gets married himself? Will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? He's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. When I told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that I was being selfish and over-dramatic ‚Äì that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. I told her that this was unacceptable and that I was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. It's my wedding too and I was his boyfriend there. 

After that I got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. However, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. I do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. I love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. I told my brother and he said that I was being the asshole here ‚Äì that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. I still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. Would I be the asshole if I did this? Am I being unreasonable here?",AmItheAsshole

About to end my engagement/five year relationship,"I am about to end my engagement.  I started to seriously doubt things months ago when, after a fight, my fiance said that he was glad we worked things out because I made him so mad that he wanted to choke me.  Since then, I've tried to bring up the statement several times because I felt that it was a threat and extremely hurtful.  During that same fight, he called me a moron because I told him I didn't understand why this specific issue was making him so upset.  Every time I try to have a conversation about it, he says I needed to hear that to know how angry he was.  The fight was about how our dog may think that I'm more dominant than he is because of something I did while playing with the pup.

&#x200B;

A few weeks ago, my fiance called me and berated me because the car that I bought him has some issues.  Nothing major I think; it probably just needs a tire balance and the bumper fixed.  He had been calling me and berating me about it ever since I bought it for him.  I thought it was a nice car, I just wanted him to have reliable transportation since he worked far away and it put a lot of strain on our finances and relationship.  He demanded an apology for me buying him the car, but when I hesitated he hung up.  He made me so angry, that I sent him a series of nasty texts.  They were true, but I could have been more tactful.  However, I went home halfway through class to do damage control and apologize.

&#x200B;

When I got home, we started to talk.  He told me the things I said were hurtful, and I apologized.  I didn't say much and just tried to listen.  I did the best I could to validate him physically and verbally, but when it was my turn to speak, I told him that he's also said some really hateful things to me (i.e. the choking comment) and never apologized.  I kept it vague, but I confessed it was about him insinuating violence toward after he asked for clarification.  I know it wasn't right to bring up something from the past in a current argument, but it was months ago and I just couldn't stop thinking about it.  When I mentioned that comment, he immediately became enraged.  He covered his ears and started screaming that he was done with the conversation.  I never even got to say all that much.  He started screaming at me to leave, but I stood my ground (I have a dog and a cat and didn't want to leave them with him).  Then, he flipped our bed and broke the frame.  He picked up the frame and tossed it up against the ceiling so that the light fixture from the fan shattered.  He destroyed our room.  I suddenly became clear headed, and called the police.

&#x200B;

He was arrested on simple assault.  He sat in jail for about 48 hours, until his brother bailed him out.  He's home now, and things seem superficially fine.  I tentatively tried to have a conversation about going to couples counseling, but he got angry.  He insisted that he did not want a 3rd person in our relationship, and told me that if I was too afraid to talk to him about our issues outside of a counseling office, then we don't need to be together.  Any time he thinks that I'm afraid of him, or notices that I'm walking on eggshells when talking to him, he gets really volatile.  I do recall asking him to come to pre-marital counseling and/or couples therapy a few times before.  I've flat out told him that I don't mind him having emotions, but I don't like the way he expresses them, and his response is that it's censorship and that if I can't handle him being angry, then I need to leave.  I've left out a lot of other issues with our relationship to prevent this post from becoming too tedious, but there are many.

&#x200B;

I know that I have to leave him, but we have spent five years together and it's so hard.

&#x200B;

If anybody has any advice, encouragement, or even kind words, I am in desperate need now.

UPDATE: A lot of you have mentioned/asked about me seeing a therapist for 1v1 sessions, and I have been for at least 10 years.  She is helping me with all of this, too.  Also, I picked the car, and he went and looked at it with me.  I advised him that we should take it somewhere to get looked at, or keep looking, but he insisted on that one.  The issues are very minor and probably won't cost more than 300$ to fix overall.",relationship_advice

My girlfriend cries at night and it breaks my heart. Should i tell her i know that?,"Throwaway account because I feel more comfortable this way.

So, my girlfriend (21) and I (24) have dated for a year before we moved together a few months ago. She likes to sleep by herself sometimes so she moves to the couch and sleeps there. ‚âàA month ago we were sleeping separately again and when I woke up in the middle of the night because apparently my organism wanted some water, I heard some sobbing from the room where my girlfriend was sleeping. At first my sleepy brain didn't actually recognise those sounds as crying, but after focusing on them for a few minutes it was obvious for me that she was crying. The next day she looked as if nothing happened, we slept togeher and I decided not to talk about it with her. It happened again next week, when I just couldn't sleep and heard her sobbing when she was on the couch.
I figured she cries every night spends on the couch and at this point I don't really know if I should tell her I know about it.
It's worth mentioning that she's depressed and she really doesn't like showing her negative feelings or vulnerabilities and I'm afraid that if I tell her she's going to feel embarrassed or ashamed and won't talk about it again. She sees a therapist as well but I don't think it helps. She's a great person and I really love her, but that thing is killing me and I don't know what to do to make her feel better.

TIFU by accidentally submitting a suicide note as my essay for English class,"so this happened yesterday, and I've yet to see what the results of my stupidity are

It is important to know that I was suicidal a year or so ago. I still have depression and anxiety though. Also, this is a high school, and my school takes mental health **very seriously**.

So for my English class, I required to write an essay responding to a prompt on the list of prompts my teacher gave me. I decided to do the ""3 stages of life"" one, but instead of the classic ""Birth, life, and death"" stages, I made the stages of my life ""Bliss, Pain, Unknown.""  For Bliss I wrote about my childhood and how nice it was to be a lil kid. For pain, I write about how depressed I got during high school and how I wake up everyday and think about how badly I want to die. Then for Unknown, I wrote about how peaceful everything would probably be after I die. I said I was looking forward to my death too. Once I finished, I submitted it online without even reading through the whole thing once because I was right up against the deadline for submission

So fast forward to me, in my English class, about to read this essay out loud in front of a few of my classmates because we were supposed to ""peer review"" each other's essays. I read mine, and realized that it low key sounds like a suicide note. The people in my peer review group were shocked, and they tried to talk me out of killing myself (I never said I would kill myself, and I have no intention of doing so, but I did say in the essay that I was looking forward to dying, and I guess that made them think imma kill myself)

So now im just sitting there thinking to myself ""shit I just read a suicide note to my classmates! please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone""

So now im pretty sure that my teacher's gonna read my essay and tell somebody about my mental health, or even worse, she might tell my parents

TLDR; I accidentally wrote a suicide note and turned it in for my English essay assignment, and I had to read it out loud in front of a few of my classmates.

The last time she visited, she saw an old Wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the Wii Tennis game. I always enjoyed the bowling game myself.

Now to the fuck up.

I never said ""Bowl me"" oh no dear Reddit, I wrote ""Blow me""

Luckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.

TL;DR: Got Wii sports for gf's mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of Bowl me.",tifu
My late girlfriend's parents are threatening to take custody of my 18 month old daughter because they think I cant properly take care of her. How can I fight this?,"On April 5th, 2018 my girlfriend passed away after a fatal car accident and left me with our baby daughter. I work to support her and myself, and she's well taken care of, I do my best. My girlfriend's parents watch her while I work, and have recently started to drop hints that my daughter is much happier and better taken care of at their house than with me. This past weekend they sat me down and told me that they'd be going after me for custody and that they had grandparents rights and that my daughter deserves better than what I can give her. I'm heartbroken and confused, and i don't know how to fight this or what to do. Can they take her? How can I get them to leave me alone? ",legaladvice
You can criticize israel and their foreign influence without being an anti-Semite.,"People talk about how russia meddles in elections and china as well.  There is a foreign nation, with people of dual citizenship holding office in the US, large lobbyist groups and if you say a word about that you're seemingly instantly branded an anti-semite.  What is going on with this picture?  I should feel free to criticize israel for their non-signing of the nuke proliferation treaty, poor treatment of palestine, the stolen land of the Palestinians, etc, etc etc, without being labeled an alt right bigot.
I am not alt right, I am not even on the right at all but I hold these views.

A guy walks into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him.," The waitress asks for their orders. The guy says, ""A hamburger, fries, and a coke,"" and turns to the ostrich, ""What's yours?""

""I'll have the same,"" says the ostrich.

A short time later the waitress returns with the order. ""That will be $18.40 please."" The man reaches into his pocket and, without looking, pulls out the exact change for payment.

The next day, the guy and the ostrich come again and the guy says, ""A hamburger, fries, and a coke.""

The ostrich says, ""I'll have the same.""

Again the guy reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. This becomes routine until one night they enter the restaurant and the waitress asks, ""The usual?""

""No, this is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad"", says the guy.

""Me too,"" says the ostrich.

The waitress brings the order and says, ""That will be $42.62.""

Once again the guy pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. The waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. ""Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?""

""Well,"" says the guy, ""several years ago I was cleaning my attic and found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.""

""That's brilliant!"" says the waitress. ""Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!""

""That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there,"" says the guy.

The waitress asks, ""But, sir, what's with the ostrich?""

The guy sighs and answers, ""My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say.""",Jokes

UPDATE: I [22F] broke up with my [34M] boyfriend (7 months ago) because I found an engagement ring. He came to my work today and PROPOSED. Help me. Please.,"First of all I'd like to thank everyone for their input on my other post. I know it was all over the place and at first I was on the defence in the comments and refusing to see the situation from any angle other than my own, but as time when on and I got more responses/messages, my point of view has shifted. Thank you for really persevering with me and helping me to see it from a different side. I really appreciate it. 

If you kept up with the last post and followed it to any extent, then you will know that I was meeting with my ex after work today to discuss the whole proposal and to discuss the whole relationship in general. Well, I did. He came to my place after work. And I'm crying as I type this, because the majority of you were right about him. My heart feels broken and I don't know what to do from here. I can go into a lot more detail on this post as opposed to my last one, and I can clarify things more now because I'm no longer defending him. This post is gonna be a very long post so, I'm warning you now you may be here long.

When he came around to my house, my best friend had came too for support and she went upstairs and kept the bedroom door open to make sure that if I needed any help then I could get it. He was not happy that she was there, I told him that's the only way I'll speak is if she's there because I don't think being alone together is appropriate.
First of all, he went on a tangent about how I should never of made that post and that I was stupid to do it, he's asked me like 1000 times to remove it, because I changed the password to the account before I made the post he's extremely angry he can't take it down. He was focused on that at the beginning until our conversation progressed, and he was getting incredibly irate such as pacing back and forth, huffing and puffing, throwing things. Whenever he made accounts, he would always make sure that everything to do the account was in his control. 
For those of you who didn't read the comments previously, or for those who just wanted more info, when me and him were together he would have me make accounts which were solidly adult content. 

First of all it started with a Tumblr where he would post the content we'd make together such as pics/vids and share them with his friends and brag, then that progressed into making me Reddit accounts where he'd have me post any sexual experiences we'd had together or sexual experiences that he'd planned for me. Most of which, I weren't comfortable with. I mentioned last time in the comments he'd use phrases like ""If you love me, you'll do it"", ""You know how happy it would make me"", ""You'll enjoy it"", ""vanilla is boring, you don't want me to be bored"", and those are just the ones that stick in my mind, there's more. He'd use those phrases to get me to engage in certain sexual behaviour, he'd involve his friends, have us do CNC, specifically plan for something to happen and do so he could then get me to write a detailed post about it. The public posting of the experiences got him off and I wanted to make him happy.
And before you mention as multiple people have on the first post - this current account which I'm posting this on, he made and had me use during our break up and he asked me to delete all the other accounts and posts and instead repost them on this account. Stupidly I didn't question his intentions and I know I was naive, I just thought as I hurt him it was the least I could do. Obviously to him, that meant he still had some sort of control over me even despite our break up. Also him not having access to it anymore really fuelled him.

We spoke about our sex life, and I asked him why he treated me like basically a sex toy, why he would pressure me into doing all of those things when he knew I was apprehensive, and he denied it. Said there was no pressure from him, just that he thought I would enjoy all those things and I'd want to do them with him because the thought I would want a 'healthy' sex life (his words). Honestly, by this point when he was talking I could just see through his bullshit, and it was having no affect on me anymore, just making me angry. Just from that, I started to feel a bit more sane and like I could finally stand up for myself and like my feelings for him were no longer blinding me. I was just angry that he would blatantly lie to my face, we argued over it and in regards to that he snapped at me and said ""you should consider yourself lucky that I've not put any of what I have on you on social media, I could ruin your life but I choose not to because I love you and I'm not that type of person""
Like, fucking really? Who even says that? That's such a passive threat. So, now I'm expecting that to happen some point soon.

Then the conversation moved onto that god damn ring. I told him that it was inappropriate and unfair of him that after 7 MONTHS of no romantic contact or talk, that he would propose out of the blue. I told him I didn't want to marry him, or even be with him now. He didn't like that, and got aggressive with me. Told me I'd never find anyone like him, how no one would ever marry me especially because I can't have kids so I'm useless to most men so I should marry him because he ""loves me more than life"" and would never hurt me, all whilst getting up in my face and poking me on the forehead, obviously in an attempt to make me feel small and like he's in charge. 
I kept telling him on what planet does he think he can do all this and then just expect me to roll over and take it? And his response was ""you did for 4 years"". So, the majority of you were right, to him I was literally just some inexperienced girl who he could manipulate and take advantage of, he clearly didn't love me. And all of this actually hurts, because I genuinely loved this person, and now I'm confused about how I could've been so naive to not notice anything. Part of me thinks I was so preoccupied with ending up like my parents that I missed all the warning signs and like many of you said - it became a self fulfilling prophecy. 

I gave him the ring back and told him I don't want to see him anymore, he then turned to begging after he realised intimidation wasn't working. Literally, him on his knees with crocodile tears and his arms wrapped around my legs telling me how much he loves me, he'll buy me whatever I want (I've never been financially dependent on him, I have my own place) and do whatever I want him to do to make it right. I told him there's nothing I want from him anymore and that I want him to leave, and just like before he flicked back to being aggressive. It wasn't poking me in the face or anything, he was 'hugging' (more like restraining) me, kissing, groping me, putting his hands down my pants/up my top whilst telling me it'll make me feel better and I'll remember why I love him. At which point there was a knock at the door, my friend thankfully had text her dad what was going on and he came around and asked him to leave otherwise the police will be phoned, and he told him to never contact me again or he'll make him feel as intimidated as he was making me feel. His face was a picture, he really didn't like someone talking to him the way he speaks to me.

So he said he'd leave, in the process of leaving he threw the ring box at my head, no idea why, literally zero point. My friends dad pushed him out the door whilst he was shouting all sorts of abuse at me. And that was the end of that.
Now I'm expecting he's not going to leave me alone, especially after the passive aggressive threat that he could ruin my life, I've asked to talk to my manager tomorrow so I can warn her of what happened and that he may post stuff about me on social media in an attempt to get me to lose my job.
My best friends dad said he'll take me to the police station tomorrow and we'll start a report because he's worried that after what my friend told him that it won't be the last I hear from him, so at least if anything else happens I've started one and can eventually get a restraining order against him.

Thank you for all your advice, seriously. I received a lot of criticism on my last post but I'm thankful to the people that kept giving me advice even when I was defending him and in denial, without you I wouldn't of had the courage to end it. I also wouldn't have been able to see it from a different perspective because I was so far under his spell.
I'm pretty upset right now, because this was my first proper relationship and I did genuinely love him, and now because I know he was manipulating, taking advantage of me and treating me like a fetish I don't really know what to think, and I feel stupid and like an idiot that I didn't notice it. And now I don't know where I go from here, and I'm worrying he's going to get even more irrational, aggressive or weird with me because he's really not happy.
I've already spoke to my doctor this morning about counselling, so I'll be starting the healing process soon. I guess I've gotta focus on myself now. I'll be expanding my friendship group too and letting people know I won't be going to any events if he's there etc, I've blocked him on all social media, I know he'll be here reading this though because he doesn't need an account to read so blocking him will do nothing.
I just hope I can get through this.

I'm one of those people, where if I fall asleep I sometimes forget what I was doing before I went to sleep.

So I was playing RE7 in VR, but it was getting kinda late but I wanted to stay up and play anyways. I started to fall asleep, and just passed out kinda instantly.

Then I woke up, my head felling weirdly heavy. BUT HOLY SHIT I JUST WOKE UP AND ALL I CAN SEE AROUND ME IS A DARK ROOM WITH SOME TABLES CHAIRS ALL I CAN HEAR ARE CREEPY NOISES AND ITS DARK OUTSIDE AND  I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM. 

So logically I stand up from my chair( i didn't even check to look, but I'm pretty sure my in game guy was standing) and run and scream.

Somehow my arm got around my monitor( or maybe a cord idk), I also ran into the wall (which made no sense to me because I wasn't even near a wall), and then it happened.

I start to feel hands all around me(my mom), and the feeling of something come in or out of my ear(my earbuds that I didn't know were there), and the sound of my mom asking ""What the hell, are you ok?""

She took the headset off of me, and I see the destruction I did to my monitor, and the small dent/damage to the wall.

Trying to force someone into Atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into Christianity.,"I am one of those Atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. I would honestly rather just let people be. I don't think I am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. I have been seeing several threads on Reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. Albert Einstein was a Jew, does being an Atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? No.

And it also makes me cringe when Atheists try to force religious people into Atheism. If we are going to strongly condemn Christians trying to force others into Christianity, we should condemn Atheists trying to force Atheism on to other people.

If it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

Edit: Thanks for bringing Einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically Jewish, growing up in a Jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. That being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. Isaac Newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) Christian. If you don't want to use scientists as an example, James Madison, who wrote the Bill of Rights that is idolized by many, was also Christian.

If two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped,"I see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. If two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? The logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? I will never understand this or accept it. I agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. Reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. I cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

Edit: I've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things I think I should clarify. I absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. I have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. Im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what I have seen and what I believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

(UPDATE 2) My Roommate's (21F) Parents keep Letting Themselves into My (21F) Apartment with the spare key she gave them.,"Okay guys, I'm sorry for updating you guys late and for the super long post, but I want to make sure I get important details in there. 

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bl31eh/my_roommates21f_parents_keep_letting_themselves/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

TLDR: My family helped and we're getting her evicted. 

I THINK RM IS CRAZY and needs a MH checkup. Seriously. I am very worried for her wellbeing. 

My mom was home, along with my brother, my brother's girlfriend, and her parents. I told them everything that happened, and no one liked what they heard. My mom called my dad to tell him what happened.

When my dad came home, he hugged me immediately and started crying. Me being called a prostitute and a slut was too much for him to handle. I've never seen dad cry before, and it hurt me so so bad. 
My mom called RM and RD and R to come over to talk. They came over immediately (they probably knew something was up from the tone of my mom's voice, she was so close to growling). 

Mom was being petty though, when they came home, she didn't allow them inside. She made them stand on the doorstep the whole time, and I could tell this was pissing RM off. Some points of the confrontation:

1. Why are you calling my daughter these names?
RM: I didn't say anything. She's making¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† up lies. 

2. Why are you even in the apartment that much? You told us that you go there once a month to check on R. You also said she visits you every weekend?
RM: The kids don't know how to cook, so I help. Also kids are busy studying so they need it. 

3. Why is a 50 year old man in my daughter's apartment?
-no answer-

4. Why are you going through my daughter's stuff? Why does she need a lock? Why are YOU limiting my daughter's times with her friends? 
-no answer-

*I shall also mention that Roommate's dad was SITTING IN THEIR CAR ON THE DRIVEWAY DURING THIS WHOLE CONFRONTATION*

But things got heated up really quickly. RM started insulting my parents:

- She said my mom is a bad mom because she never disciplined her children.

- she said I am unruly and that the clothes I wear are despicable (she brought up clothes a shit ton, like this lady is really offended by my fashion sense). This annoyed my brother, and he showed RM IG pictures of R wearing more revealing clothing than me, and sitting on boys laps. RM shut her mouth about my clothes immediately. 

- She then proceeded to try to insult my parent's professions by saying they have ""God Complexes"". This pissed my brother off to the brink, and he replied with "" you own 3 subways and are almost broke, but we never say anything about it."" This pushed RM OFF THE EDGE, and she leaned in closer to my brother and attempted TO SLAP HIM. 

This lady tried to SLAP my 24 y/o brother IN FRONT OF MY PARENTS. 

They argued more, and my mom asked where the dress was again. This time, she walked away to their car, and pulled my dress out of her purse. She came back to where we were standing AND LITERALLY THREW THE DRESS IN MY FACE.

My mom had no more patience left, and back Slapped RM across her face. I've never seen my mom raise her hand on anyone, and I burst out laughing. Even my dad had to walk back inside to keep himself from laughing in front of RM. RM started crying and said she was going to call the cops on us. 

When they left we had a big discussion:

My parents were angry that I never told them about this before. They said that they got me that apartment so I could do what I wanted. They wanted me to be able to have friends over, have a place to chill, and have a place without parental influence. 
However, they are very proud and happy with the way I dealt with the situation, and said calling the cops would unnecessarily escalate the situation that could be solved by talking. Thank you all for the advice. I appreciate it alot. ‚ù§

They were mad at my brother cause they said he shouldn't have shown those pictures of R cause now she has to deal with that trouble at home. 

My parents agreed that letting R live in my apartment without consulting me first was wrong on their part. My parent's started the eviction process today. 

Anyways, it may be hard to believe, but I do stand up for myself a lot. It's just that in this situation, I didn't want to do anything that would offend my parents because I had respect for their friendship and I didn't want to ruin it or do something that would embarrass my parents. I learned from this, and I have growing up to do, but now that I know I have support, I won't worry about petty shit like this later. 

I also don't want to live alone so one of my best friends from high school is gonna be my new roommate(no, she isn't Indian). No one is living rent free in this situation. 

I would also like to say that even though I wasn't friends with R in high school, living with her for 2 years did help me make a bond with her. Idk if we can be friends after this, but it feels bad losing a friend. 

Also my parents are liberal ass Indians. They have lived here in America for over 40 years. They didn't want to spy on me at all. They don't mind me wearing skirts or tube tops or having guy friends over. 

Edit 1: I forgot to add, for those of you guys who think that my parents paying my rent and tuition doesn't make me an adult, I don't think it does. I'm so blessed to have parents who want to make sure that their kids graduate without debt. Also, it's my parent's money. They'll do what they want. This gives me no excuse to have a GPA less than a 4.0, Js. 

Edit 2: I took out the part where RM tried to threaten me with a wooden spoon to shorten the post.  It was funny though. 

Edit 3: I added a TLDR. 

I included most of the important points. If something doesn't make sense I'll reply in the comments. 

The cops are yet to show up. 

Edit 4: GUYS WE FORGOT TO ASK FOR THE KEY BACK. FUCKING DAMN ITTTT

As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.

After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming.""

He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, ""What would you say is my best feature?""

TIFU by not wearing underwear to work,"This definitely happened today, though I wish it hadn't. 

A bit of backstory, this morning the apartments fire alarm went off so we all had to clear out for a bit. In my haste, I skipped putting on underwear. 

I decided to take a nap a while later and when I woke up, I decided to just go to work without remedying the underwear situation. ""It's only a 5 hour shift,"" I thought. It'll be fine. 

I get to work, everything is fine. Happy hour starts, we're prepared for the worst. I'm sipping my water in the back briefly and reach down to adjust myself.

Imagine my horror when I touch my entire ballsack.  I've never been so alarmed to touch my own balls. My pants, at some point, had ripped clean down the middle and The Bois‚Ñ¢ were out and about. 

I had to explain that I was having a wardrobe emergency and ran to call my roommate who thankfully showed up with a new pair of pants and underwear. It was a long 45 minutes that I just had to pretend my balls weren't enjoying the draft. 

TL;DR I didn't put on underwear, pants ripped at work and my balls enjoyed some brief freedom.

Fianc√© has Dropbox folder of all nudes and of sexually explicit acts from all of his past exes and hookups‚Äîincluding coworkers who doesn't know he has them and women he's said he's never been with.,"Me: 30F
Fianc√©: 38M

We've been together for 5+ years and engaged for just the past few months. Throughout the course of our relationship, a few women would constantly reach out to him. When I asked about them, he told me that they were just friends and that nothing had happened between them. 

This past week, I was playing a game we play together on his iPad when a questionable text came in. I went into the text messages and found out that he had been lying about talking to and grabbing lunches with one of his current friends from work. Being really angry and insecure about it I then went through his phone. We have access to each other's phones to play each other's dumb games when one of us isn't felling well but I have always respected his privacy up until this point.

What I discovered was a Dropbox folder with a bunch of folders with women's initials. In each folder was pictures of nudes his ex's and hookups had sent him, pictures of him or her performing sexual acts on each other, and pictures of me that were taken while I was so black out drunk I couldn't remember them being taken. 

Several of the women in the photos were women he swore up and down to me were just childhood friends/coworkers and that I had nothing to worry about even though he had daily conversations with one and the other would text him heart and I love you's. 

After some discussion he admitted that some of the pictures he had taken off of his coworkers computer without their consent. He is an IT professional with access to all of his coworkers computers. 

I checked through time stamps and I don't believe any of this was sent during the duration of our relationship together. I am still very upset that he lied about his relationship level with several people and the pictures he had of me and that he violated his coworker's privacy as well.  He insists he has never gone back to this folder while we were together. I feel like I'd be very disturbed if I were one of these women and knew that he still had these photos. 

Regarding the original girl, he just didn't want to tell me because he thought I'd be mad. I am much madder that he lied than that he has a female friend that he gets lunch with.  After we hashed this out, I asked him if there was anything else he was lying about or hiding from me or if there's anything else I should know and I wouldn't get mad. He lied. Two days later I found this personal ""porn"" stash. 

I am so shocked and have no idea what to make of this situation. Am I making a bigger deal out of this than it really is? Is this grounds for ending the engagement? The relationship as a whole? Part of me wants to tell these other women what he did but at the same time I just forced him to delete the whole folder permanently so it couldn't be restored. 

He claims that he had a sex addictions the time that he was still working through as we started dating which I'm sure I can believe but I don't have any experience with this but I'm just so overwhelmed and caught off guard that I don't know how to make a rational decision right now.

Edit: First I want to thank everyone reaching out. This relationship has been very hard for me since the beginning but I was always made to feel like my feelings were crazy and that he was doing nothing wrong. I can't help but doubt myself even though I know in my heart that this just isn't right. I'm shocked, upset, disturbed, disgusted, and so many things right now. I feel like I can't even turn to my own friends and family because I'm embarrassed, as has been the case since pretty much day 1. I probably should have left a long time ago but for some reason I always felt like I was to blame. What's going on is beyond not ok and I am now figuring out what my next steps will be. Thank you again for all of the support.

Edit #2: Regarding the ""secret porn stash,"" it wasn't porn from the internet. I was referring to his collection of photos from women from previous relationships. I was always ok with him watching porn and we both did it together. I was disturbed that he kept the photos of exes though. It was also from more people than he had admitted to being with which was another lie unearthed.",relationship_advice

TIFU by not hiding my dildo well enough,"Two days ago I got my first dildo. Since I still live with my parents, I obviously had to hide the the sinful monstrosity. Where would be the best place to hide a sex toy? Perhaps up high in the corner of my closet. Nah, I'm short, horny, and lazy so I didn't want to climb up there everytime I wanted to get off. 

Well, under my bed the boxspring has a hole in it, perfect for objects such as a dildo. The hiding spot is set up so that when you look under the bed, you can't see the hiding spot, just the empty space underneath. 

I decide to hide my dildo, as well as a several other items of contraband (condoms and an anal plug), balanced on a piece of plywood in the boxspring. Perfect place for it, why would anyone be searching under there anyways.


After I get off work, I'm greeted with a text from my mom that says, ""We need to talk.""



Oh fuck, she found my dildo didn't she.


Turns out, while I was away at work, my mom was searching for a pair of her shoes (that I did not have) in my bedroom. I'm assuming the bed got bumped causing the dildo to fall off the piece of plywood onto the ground, but the point is she found my veiny purple dildo. 

For context, my family's religious and I don't seem like the type that would have a dildo. 


Here's a couple highlights of the conversation:


Her - I found a purple dick under your bed.


Me - Oh really? Hahahahaha


Her - I haven't had sex in [a long time] and even I've never bought one of those.


Me - Oh, well if you want I could buy one for you.
[I'm aware this wasn't the best thing to say, but I seem to lose any filter I have when I'm nervous]


At least she chuckled at that, maybe because of shock. But it made the situation slightly more bearable. 


Her - Why do you have one anyways?


Me - Well it's just my curiosity, hormones, and I felt bad for wasting so many cucumbers.
[Again, another stupid thing to say but I don't think she heard. Or she ignored me]


Then she brought up the condoms, guess a couple fell down with the toy, and asked if I was sexually active. I assured her I'm not, and that I got them because they were cheap and so that I could use it on the dildo when I didn't feel like washing it. Truth is, I got them because they were colorful (pink, yellow, and green) and I thought it would be funny to whip those bad boys out if I ever do have sex. But I felt like I had embarrassed myself enough already.

She was more disappointed in me than angry. I think we both shared feelings of shame and embarrassment, but she reacted differently than I thought she would. I have no idea how I'm going to look her in the eyes tomorrow.


At least she didn't find my butt plug. 



TL;DR - Bought my first sex toy a couple days ago. Found a good hiding spot for it, turns out it wasn't good enough and my mom found it. Don't know how I'm gonna look her in the eyes tomorrow knowing what she knows about me. Also relocated my toy to the upper shelf of the closet. Hid the other stuff in other places of my room. Don't wanna keep all my eggs in one basket. 


EDIT: I am 18 and female. I bought my dildo and butt plug at the same time, I refer to my dildo as my ""first"" sex toy because I used it first. Hope that clarifies some things :)



UPDATE: It's 9:30 AM and I still havent seen her. She isn't even in the house 


UPDATE #2: It's noon and she's still not home. Gonna give her a call.


UPDATE #3: Just called her and she didn't answer. Sent her a text too. Haven't seen her since last night. Getting kinda worried she might be avoiding me. 


UPDATE #4: Just got a text back from her, I guess we're gonna forget this all happened. Which is fine by me :) I'll update if she mentions it when she gets home.

AITA for asking for the gift receipt to return offensive baby clothes?,"Yesterday we had a baby shower. Long story short, one of our family friends thought it would be funny to get some baby onesies with offensive things written on them. For example: 

* ""All daddy wanted was a blow job"" 
* ""I'm with the milf"" 
* ""To-do list: Eat, poop, suck some titties"" 

There were like 2 more but I don't remember what they said. When I opened the gift I was humiliated, I thought it was really inappropriate. Before people on here give me shit about not being able to take a joke, I just didn't really think this was the funniest ""joke."" I was mad about the gift because as I was opening and before I could read what they said, I unfolded the onesie and showed the rest of the party. Some people gave let out a small chuckle, some people looked around at each other kinda surprised. Anyhow, at the end of the party, I asked the person who gave it to me if I could have the gift receipt to return them. I said I definitely wouldn't put my baby in those clothes. The person basically called me oversensitive and said I needed to take a joke. I handed the gift bag back to them and said ""Alright, well then you can keep these."" They were super offended by that and thought it was an ungrateful gesture. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

What started as peaceful protests against tyranny and for rights like representation, has escalated into something violent. Individuals are facing danger and horrible odds heroically for what they believe is right. In school that's how I was taught about the American Revolution. Freedom and the need for the people to stand up for what is right is the basis of America as a country. That also could very well describe the current protests in Hong Kong.

Update on: I'm a female born without a vagina. How do I tell a guy that I'm interested in about it?,"Here is the link to my first post, if you're interested: [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9w3o3w/im_a_female_born_without_a_vagina_how_do_i_tell_a/)

I apologize for the length of this, but I supposed I needed something for me to layout what happened and come to terms with it. So, if just want a plain update, and don't want to read this (which will probably end up being very long): 

I**n short, it went terrible. And frankly, I didn't handle it well.** 

The original plan was to get coffee, see how the date went and go on from there. He told me he had been recently fat-fished (not sure if that is the correct term, but he had previous met up with a girl that was waaaay heavier than what was presented in her dating profile, and it allegedly went poorly). 

He was texting me less and less leading up to the day we planned on meeting, last Wednesday. He texted me Tuesday morning saying that he was sick, and apologized for the lack of communication. I had classes that day and was only able to get back to him later in the evening. I asked him if he was busy because I wanted to call him, see how he was feeling, and figure out what the plan was. I told him that health comes first, and we can always reschedule, but he insisted how badly he wanted to see me. Somehow he convinced me to see him Tuesday, at his place, even though he was sick.

Once I got to his place, he was extremely sweet and nice. We totally hit it off, he complimented me a lot, said I was cute and hugged me, twice, all excitedly like when a puppy see's you when you get home after a long day. He made us coffee, and we talked about life, school, family, hobbies/interests, etc. It was going very well. We got into the discussion of movies/tv shows, and he ended up turning on his TV, and switched to Netflix. I asked him if he watched any anime. Personally, I'm not big on anime but I've seen a few shows because my younger brother is into it. I recommended Full Metal Alchemist to him and we started watching that. He asked if he could sit closer to me, I said yes, and he noticed I was cold, so he turned up the heat and brought out a blanket for us. I had my head resting on his chest with his arm around me, and I joked about how fast his heart was beating. He said that it was probably because he had a cute girl sitting with him. In that moment, I realized I had to tell him about my condition. It took awhile for me to get into that discussion because 1) I just wanted to hold on to that moment for a bit longer and 2) I wanted to tell him, but I couldn't get the words to come out. He looked at me and tried going in for a kiss, but I pulled away. I said that I had to tell him something and asked him to turn off the tv. He obliged. I just froze after that. I literally couldn't get the words to come out in the way I wanted them to or how to begin to talk coherently. Even though I asked for advice in the previous post, I totally went blank in that moment and none of it was implemented effectively. I tried changing the conversation because I felt like I was going to cry but he assured me that I could tell him. I honestly don't remember what I said because I'm pretty sure my brain shut down, but I managed to mumble some sort of god-awful explanation. He asked a few questions, and then said he wasn't sure if he could be in a relationship that doesn't involve sex. He said that we could keep it casual for now and see where things went. 

Even though I originally went in with the worst expectation, I was still hurt by what he said. I felt really let down because he met a lot of the things on my checklist and I thought we connected well. I asked what ""keep it casual"" specifically meant for him, and he said that we could be exclusive, but he didn't want to get too emotionally attached. I guess that was the part that really stung. I told him that I wasn't looking for a definitive answer yet because it was still too early to tell anything, and I wasn't looking for marriage, but if he knew right now, for a fact, that he can't be in a serious relationship with someone that has my condition then I wasn't interested. I know myself too well and honest to god I can't get involved with someone without getting emotionally attached and agreeing to ""see where it went"" would be intentionally setting myself up to get hurt. Plus, I think that was just his way of saying no to me nicely. He politely said that we could both take a few days to think about what we wanted, and he'd let me know. He was just trying to let me down easy, because we both knew what he meant. It was around 8:30pm by the time we got done with that discussion and I said that I should probably leave. He walked me to the elevator, in silence, and as I was about to enter the elevator he asked if I would still be interested in being friend because he enjoyed my company. I said I wasn't sure, and that I'd talk to him later. By the time I got down to the 1st floor and out the building, I had tears down my face and I felt like absolute shit. 

Pretty much every guy I have told about my condition would later go on to say that we could be FWB or something more 'friendly'. I just felt like no one would ever want me for me, and that all I would be good for is some side action. I felt really alone. I felt that the only reason I had ever been in a relationship previously was because I hadn't been diagnosed with my condition when I started dating my ex, and we had already been together for a year when I did find out. I felt like he only stayed with me a year longer was because we had an emotional bond, but even that came to an end when he cheated on me. I'm not THAT insecure but at that time I couldn't think straight. I had just experienced something nice, and it was instantly taken away from me. I haven't had many friends after my ex cheated on me with my best friend and I cut contact with everyone in that circle and making friends at University is difficult if you're a commuter. I ended up calling a guy I know as I walked back to the subway. I don't really consider him a friend anymore because he has told me he has feelings for me, but I don't feel the same way back towards him, and he makes constant cheesy statements about me and him despite me telling him not to. I don't want him getting too attached to me, so I keep my distance. But in that moment, I really needed someone, and I didn't have any other option. So I called him, he picked up, I asked if he was busy, and he said he was playing a game with friends and he could call me back later... I didn't want to bother him like that, so I told him it wasn't necessary. So, I did something  very stupid, and called my ex. His gf (the girl he cheated on me with) had him block my number, so it went straight to voicemail. Like any insane person, I left a very pathetic voicemail, sobbing and all. I said I didn't have anyone to talk to and apologized for calling him, but I couldn't think of anyone else to talk to. I didn't mention what happened or anything, just that I needed someone. I stood outside in the cold (its snowing here) for awhile until my whole body felt numb. I gathered myself and thought ""C'mon, what are the fuck are you doing? This is not you. You're better than this."" I promptly got on the subway, went home, got into bed, and went to sleep. 

I woke up the next morning with a fever (that's what I get for getting too close to a guy that's sick) but still had to go to class and attend tutorials. I thought about my reaction a lot, and how poorly I had handled it. Clearly, I have issues I need to work on. I stayed late after the tutorial getting extra help, and after my TA was done helping all the other students, I went to her office and privately asked her if she had any recommendations for someone that I could talk to on campus. She asked me if it had to do with academic stress or something more personal. I said the latter. She pulled out her laptop so quick and got me numbers/emails/addresses for places I could contact on campus. She told me that she understood and that she too was having issues a couple months ago and recommended a clinic she had been to personally. I couldn't stop thanking her. Before I left, I said, ""It's not a big deal or too serious, I guess things could always be worse"" and without skipping a beat, she said ""Yeah, but things could also be a lot better."" I thanked her for her help and left. 

He hasn't texted me in 2 days now. I'll wait a little longer, but I guess I got my answer. I realize I am not ready for dating. For the time being, I should get help.

Its not that I can't handle rejection, but that fact that time and time again, I get guys who are totally into me, and aren't looking for sex right away because they want something more meaningful, but as soon as I mention no sex at all (for now, at least), they turn me down. If they rejected me right from the start, and we didn't get along well, I could handle that perfectly fine. I cant help but think I'm a defective human, and will never find a guy who would appreciate me for me. 

I have yet contact the number my TA gave me.

If you've read this far, thank you. If you have any advice, things I should improve on, better ways to handle situations like this, constructive criticism, or any other comments, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you. 

Edit: I woke up to a thousand notifications lol I was not expecting for this post to blow up! Thanks to whoever gilded this. I have no idea what it means or what it does, but thanks! 

I just want to thank each and every one of you guys that took the time out of your day to comment on here. I spent a good chunk of my morning just reading the comments. Your kindness and honesty has really touched my heart. Some comments made me tear up. I didn't know I needed to hear the things I did. Thank you. A lot of people also reached out to me personally and offered to talk to me, after I said that I didn't have many friends to talk to. You guys are one of the nicest people ever. I truly do appreciate it. The internet is one hell of a thing!

Edit: I'm getting a lot of questions and comments about my conditions and the specifics of it. I'm currently a little busy right now but I'm going to add another edit later today or make another post about it, explaining it better and why my condition wasn't diagnosed when I was born and a little more about my family situation and options for surgery.

AITA for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner,"Ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


Rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. She would make noises in between conversations like ""Bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""Awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. This is especially embarrassing when I am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


I have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. I have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


It was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. We went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""Yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. Owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


Seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. I rolled my eyes and told her:


""I am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. Please excuse me."" 


Then I left the restaurant without her. I don't know what occurred to me but I probably shouldn't have done that, but I guess it kinda just snapped. AITA?",AmItheAsshole

&#x200B;

Wow, just wanted to say thanks everyone for the advice.  As expected I received a ton of different opinions, and I thank you all.  However some of them really helped put me in a better state of mind.  Specifically those of you that opened my eyes to the fact that it may have still been abuse despite the texts, and even shared some of your own personal stories that relate to my wife's story.  It helped me approach her in a less accusatory manner.  

&#x200B;

I had a long and productive discussion with my wife last night about the things that I had found and that bothered me.   
 I told her I just wanted the truth, and that I wasn't angry.  She explained that while she was abroad she was partying and drinking pretty heavily, and at the time that F took advantage of her, she didn't fully understand what had happened.  She was in denial after it happened since she never expected a friend to do that.  She was surprised she even sent some of those texts to him, and she said she was likely drunk and trying to convince herself that it was okay.  When F finally left the country a couple days later and she had time to really think about it, she realized that what had happened was wrong.  She had told F to stop but didn't have the strength to physically stop it, she had no choice in the situation.  She also pointed out that once F left, she had stopped talking to him because of this, which was true in the texts.  They went from talking nearly every day to nothing instantly.  There were also some other things she pointed out that line up with the texts to suggest that after it happened, she took some measures to avoid having sex with him again(for example, sharing a bed with someone else when the option to sleep with F was available).

&#x200B;

I know some of you wanted me to talk to F.  But I have no desire to, and I definitely would have a harder time believing anything from him.  There was plenty of texts from F to W lying about me in order to give himself an opportunity with her.  He lied to her saying I was getting back with my ex(who lived 1000 miles from me, and had a boyfriend at the time), and told W countless times she never had a chance with me.  W had told me these things in the past and the texts all back that up.  

&#x200B;

My wife's story is consistent with any other time she has ever told me, and after our discussion I'm sticking by her side.  We discussed our other relationship issues too.  Like I said, we had been struggling recently.  But the past month has actually been better than the previous 6 or so.  Not perfect, but definitely an improvement.  She told me that the main reason for some of her actions and words was simply being pregnant, uncomfortable, and not having anyone besides me to vent her frustrations out to.  She was sorry for how she treated me and is going to work on herself to be better.  She wasn't mad that I looked through her messages, she even said I'm welcome to look.  But she promised she has nothing to hide.  Whether you agree or disagree with me, I married this woman for a reason.  And while we may be in a bit of a difficult time, I believe we are on the right path.

Swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever.,"When you swim in denim jeans it's like you're an armored aquatic creature. The way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. Feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

Depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. I personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. They (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they're soaking wet. 

Also, when your jeans are soaked, they're heavier. It's always leg day when your jeans are wet. 

If you haven't tried swimming in baggy jeans I suggest doing so. It will change your life.

I purchased a vehicle and was assaulted by the salesmen when I went to pick it up several days later. What type of lawyer should I contact? Additional details in post,"A bit of a doozy...

I purchased a car Saturday in Massachusetts. I paid 10k in a bankers check and financed the remainder. Upon pickup on Tuesday,  I was told I was given a rebate (which was not in any of my paperwork) that I was not entitled to. The dealership told me I need to pay $500 or else I can't have the vehicle. At this point, I already had a contract, the keys to the vehicle, had the vehicle insured, signed over the title to my old vehicle...everything I needed aside from registration. As far as I was concerned it was my property at the time. After a verbal back and forth the salesman got tough and told me to back down or he would F me up etc etc. After threatening me, I told him he couldn't do that. He then rushed me and violently pushed me . At that point, for my own safety, I tackled him and we were separated by all the other employees. During the separation he hit me several more times because I was the only individual restrained by the other employees. The other employees collected my paperwork that was lost in the altercatiin and shredded it. The police were called and I filed a report. I have yet to request the police press charges. I declined to initially because after the altercation they had possession of my $10k, my new car and the title to my old car. I had no paperwork other thank the bankers check made to and cashed by the company, and an autopolocy with associated VIN.  Police told me they couldn't help with the civil side regarding the cars and money, only the assault. If I requested the charges be pressed I couldn't help but think i would have been out that money and both cars for a long time as the civil thing plays out.  I sustained a potentially broken nose and a medium cut to the knee... and what sucked the most for me...the brand new watch, which my wife gave me little more than 3 weeks ago as a gift on our wedding day...is destroyed.

Saturday is also my dad's day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got ""called into work"" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.

This made me think about all the possible (private) things I could do to anything around the house. Then I saw; **the $700 LEATHER COUCH**. I executed my plan. 
Materials needed: Dish soap, a couch, and rags

I started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. Then, I put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. Then, the couch bestiality commenced. Lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin I am, and there was no turning back. 

Another detail about my dad getting called into work is that I was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. On a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. 

Not today

He left at 9:30 am for work, and I was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which I felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn't supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. Then it **happened**. The couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight

[here](https://imgur.com/wi2nz1Q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.

I heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. The knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. He gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words ""what the fuck are you doing"". I couldn't decide what to do, so I just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags I stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly ""sorry^sorry^sorry"". He walked back out but before he shut the door, he said ""don't clean that; im throwing it away, now."". The rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.

TL;DR: Fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected

TIFU by handing my USB to my roommate,"**Gonna use a throwaway. I'm not giving my roommate the satisfaction of sharing this stupid shit of his on my actual account.** 

I had an essay to print out this weekend but since I no longer had my own printer, rest her poor soul, it meant driving down to the print shop. So, I wasted no time copying all my shit to a USB and grabbing my coat. I was literally just about to shut the door behind me when I heard my roommate calling my damn name. He wanted something printed out as well. A fucking flyer or some shit. Random, but ok whatever. 

He asked if he could use my USB. I didn't see why not, so I said sure. Once he was done copying the file from his laptop, he gave me back my USB and said: ""Valar Morgulis, motherfucker"". I said: ""Valar Dohearis, you degenerate turd"" and bounced. The print shop was busy when I got there but the wait was worth it because the girl who came to assist me was cute as fuck. Little did I know, this would only be the beginning of my humiliating downfall.

I handed the cute print shop girl my USB with the simple instruction of printing out the two files on there. As far as I knew, there was nothing else on the USB except those two documents. Print shop girl stared at her computer screen before locking eyes again. Her expression was unreadable. Like she was trying hard not to show an emotion. She leaned in and sheepishly asked: ""Which two files, sir?"". I replied: ""Only the two you see on there"". 

At that moment she turned the computer screen towards me and revealed that there was close to a dozen folders on there. Folders that never even existed when I copied my essay. Here's the damn punchline. All these fucking folders were labeled with hardcore, homo-erotic descriptions:

**""TINY TWINK DRILLED HARD BY HANDSOME HANDYMAN""**

**""COLLEGE STUD DRAINS HIS BIG UNCUT COCK""** 

**""CUTE BOY FUCKED IN THE ASS BY DADDY""**

**""TEASING MY DRUNK STRAIGHT FRIEND WITH RAW DICK""**

**""HIGH SCHOOL HUNKS FUCK BAREBACK""** 

**""HUNG DOCTOR GETS HEAD AFTER PHYSICAL""**

**""PLANET OF THE BOTTOMS: DAWN OF DA DICK""** 

There were loads more, but I'm sure ya'll get the pornographic picture. I shook my head in horror and said: ""That ain't mine"". Print shop girl's eyes narrowed and practically penetrated my fucking soul. 

""What should I print for you, sir?"" 

""It's my roommate... he does this kinda shit""

""Of course""

*Crickets*

I swallowed what remained of my dignity and did what had to be done. 

""Print the one called assignment, please. Under, uh... All Ass All Access. Thank you""

**Tl:dr I walked into my local print shop with an essay I had to print out. Walked out looking like a porn addict.**

&nbsp;

*Edit: Ya'll giving me too much attention. Appreciate the rewards though. Just wanna provide feedback to some of the comments. I requested that print shop girl expand the display settings to show the number of files in each folder. All the folders had 0 files except one: ""All Ass All Access"". That's how I located my essay. For the record, I'm not gonna revenge-prank my damn roommate by fucking him. Also, this throwaway isn't to hide this post from him, I just don't wanna have him think these little stunts of his are worthy of living on the Reddit account I use daily. Hence, an account that will eventually become obsolete. Valar Morghulis, ya'll.*",tifu

TIFU by wearing jeans with a hole in them,"This just happened minutes ago. I'm in a children's hospital with my wife and son because he's been having severe asthma issues.

My wife is laying in the bed with my son on top of her, and I've just been sitting in one of the chairs. As people kept coming in, I noticed some rather odd looks from them, some mumbling, and some more odd looks. I figured I had some food on my face or something and didn't think too much of it.

Suddenly, I'm sitting there reading something on reddit when my wife looks at me and says, ""What's that between your legs?""

I look down, and there's a pink ball between my legs. Confusion quickly turns to shock as I realize that pink ball is one of *my* balls. One of my testicles is literally hanging out of my pants and is sitting on the seat.

I don't have a spare pair of pants here, so now I'm just sitting with my legs tightly together like I'm wearing a skirt and praying my son doesn't stay here long.

TL;DR I found out I had a hole in my pants by multiple people noticing a testicle sitting on my chair.

**EDIT: Most common question is about my undergarments. I was indeed wearing boxers. My testicle came out the bottom of them.**

EDIT2: Wow this post really got the ball rolling (what, I can't do testy puns too?). Thank you kind stranger for the coconut reward! I had no idea such an appropriate award existed for this situation.

Caught my girlfriend (24F) masturbating and she started crying,"My girlfriend and I have a good sense of humor, we like to play around and everything. So she caught me jerking off like a month ago, she thought it was hilarious and kept teasing me about it and asking me what I was thinking about and all that stuff. It's fine, it was embarrassing for 5 minutes but she wasn't mad or weirded out so that helped. I asked her if she masturbated and she said she never did and that she didn't need to and she didn't like it.

Last week, I came home a bit early unexpectedly and she was in our bed giving herself an interesting massage. I heard her before I saw her so I came in and surprised her and I was teasing her a bit since she said she never did it and she just started crying and told me to leave. Obviously I felt like shit and apologized but she still made me go. I came back home a couple hours later and she was still upset. To this day, she is still upset. I didn't mention it again, but she's acting different. She just seems sulky and withdrawn and not interested in sex. I don't know how to bring it up without making her cry again. I had no idea she was gonna react like that, she was making fun of me for weeks, I thought she could take a joke 

And I feel dumb for not knowing that she masturbated earlier on, we've been together for 4 years and I just found out. I guess she's really good at hiding secrets

Marriage is meant to be the everlasting and unbreaking bond between two people. It has been extended to societal and legal roles in the world which is not a problem. The problem is when people treat marriages as their casual relationships. Getting married into a situation they know is unstable or doing it for stupid reasons or impulse.

"Returned a $1,175 computer back to Walmart and they refuse to refund the money.","Hi all! So I put a gaming comp on layaway with Walmart a few weeks ago so I could make payments versus $1,000+ at once. 

I finally paid it off brought it home, and the motherboard was cracked. So I returned it, unfortunately they said that amount was too much for a gift card (as I was going to immediately buy a new one) but my mom has a Walmart debit card they said it would be available to me immediately. 

Well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the Walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. 

We did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn't good enough?? She said that it had a ""different balance"" on all the receipts but that's because it was layaway and I made payments! 

She told my mother the account may never be unlocked as we did not have sufficient proof? 

I'm totally distraught, I'm a college student and I don't have extra funds this was something I worked hard for. 

Any and all advice is welcome I'm desperate. I am in the US, specifically Florida

I(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when I was told to look after the family pet.,"My siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and I've been of to uni. 

I am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. I've been trying to act like I didn't care but when they were driving to the airport I couldn't stop crying. My mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. Last time we went to a family vacation was when I was around 13. I cried so much I had cramps in my abdomen.

I wrote them a message trying to make them understand what I was feeling and that it hurt me alot. I got back that I was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. They said they thought I wanted to be ""free"". I know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions I've tried to hide come through. I've never felt this left out and I feel like I'm not a family member. I'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on Holliday.
I feel heartbroken.

My plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to Uni and dive into school to forget.

How can I forgive them? Has this happened to anyone else?

Edit: 



I would have paid for myself. This is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. They brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. They are all there. The whole family. They brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. I would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

I am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. I've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that I need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

I'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and I send all the hugs in the world to you! The feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




Edit 30 juli: 

I just wanted to say that I've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" I believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. My mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that I wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

For anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. Going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. Being away from family is hard and I missed mine alot. Being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. Please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",relationship_advice

AITA for asking my sister to be discreet about her polyamorous (Male-Female-Female) relationship in front of the kids?,"I guess it should be are ""we"" the assholes, but idk if that's an accepted acronym here. 

Apologies that the line up is a bit complicated but I'll try to lay it out as best I can. 

My family is going on a group vacation this summer. We are pooling our resources to rent a nice property on the beach for a week. My husband and I are (unfortunately) taking the lead on planning and organization. 

It will be me, my husband and our two kids, my brother, his wife, and their 3 kids, plus my parents. (Kids' ages range from 3 to 9). In addition, my sister, her husband and their girlfriend are invited.

We initially only invited my sister and her husband,  but my sister insisted that their girlfriend (who I think they've been dating for 9 months or so) be included as well. 

My sister is in a polyamorous relationship and, although my family and I don't get all of the nuances, we have tried to be understanding. So as a compromise we said that her girlfriend could come, but we asked that everyone  please refrain from any PDA in front of the kids. We were planning to just refer to the girlfriend as a friend of the family. 
My sister was not happy with this suggestion and is now, once again, saying that she will not go on the trip under these circumstances. 

At this point, everyone else is exhausted with the subject and all for letting her exclude herself from the trip. I'm conflicted though. She's my sister and I obviously love her. But I also think my other family members are trying their best in a touchy situation.

Minnesota: Landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. What now?,"For some background I am renting an apartment and my lease ends on September 30th. My landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. I do have a lease that says I get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which I believe is the law itself, but in this case I did not get that notice.

Last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8AM saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). He asked if I could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing I'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

I did not see these messages until I took lunch at 12. I texted my landlord back saying I thought I am supposed to get notice for entry and I'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though I'm sure that doesn't legally count).

Long story short they robbed me and I have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. They took everything of value such as laptop and TV and even some stupid things like my lamps.

My renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). Now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and I should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

Meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. He met them at Dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. I told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place I would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

What now? Push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? I would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",legaladvice

"It's fine to not like kids, but constantly talking about how much you hate them is just you being an asshole.","Seriously. Like I get it, kids can be gross and annoying and stressful. It's fine to not like them, it's fine to not want to be around them, and it's certainly fine to not want to have them.

What some people fail to understand is that you do not suddenly become a human being when you turn 13. Constantly talking about how gross/disgusting/annoying/etc you think kids are is honestly just rude and in my opinion, makes you a dick. Even if you're not saying it to their face, even if they're too young to even understand you ‚Äî you're just an asshole. 

Also, not trying to force people to have conversations with young children, but if you talk to some of them, like, genuinely have a conversation, a lot of very young children have valuable opinions on things. They have personalities, wants, needs, likes and dislikes, etc. They are human beings, not just carbon copies of objects meant to make your life miserable. And just like adults, you may get along with some while not get along with others.

I'm just honestly sick of people treating little kids like they aren't people yet, like they're less deserving of the same respect you would give to an adult. It's so douchey and automatically makes me want to stay 3000 miles away from you.


Edit: Okay I need to clarify some stuff. I'm usually just a lurker on reddit, I'm not used to all this attention and I'm not completely sure how to deal with it.

I think people who shove their pro kid opinions down people's throat are down right awful. People have every right in the world to not want kids and as I've mentioned in the comments, I totally get why so many people hate kids. You're allowed to hate them! They can be nasty, annoying, mean, etc. In this post I was trying to express how people who treat children like they are subhuman are assholes. I'm not trying to insult anyone's lifestyle.

Also, I deleted all the edits thanking the people who gave me awards because someone commented that it was annoying and I realized I wholeheartedly agree haha. Sorry about that! Like I said, I'm not used to my posts getting attention.

"LPT: If you want to make sure someone has learned the correct process, make them deliberately do everything as wrong as possible","Speaking as a teacher (and anyone in an educational or supervisory role will likely relate), one of the most frustrating things is when you explain a task to someone and check that they understand, only for them to completely botch it. In fairness, we often do make assumptions that because *we* can do it well, others will have the intuition to also have the same skill and knowledge. It's difficult for a learner to recognise and validate their own process as being correct. However, people are very good at recognising when something is wrong.

The way this concept was introduced to me was to play two games of tic-tac-toe. The first game: play as normal and see who wins. You normally see some cockiness as people try to outplay each other and reach the inevitable draw. There's no real thought process of how to win, just making sure the other person doesn't.

Second game: the goal was to *intentionally lose*. Suddenly, the room fell quiet. Each player had to think about doing the *wrong* move in order to lose. There was much more reflection and processing than playing to win.

This was then explained in the context of doing PowerPoint presentations. We have an idea of what a good presentation should look like (clear bullet points, minimal text, minimal distractions, etc.), but we never seem to get students to understand what we expect. Turn the expectations around: as a pre-task, get them to make the *worst possible presentation*, and you suddenly get a bunch of people engaged in outdoing each other in throwing in walls of text, spinny animations and multiple soundtracks. When the students made their proper presentations, they avoided all the things that they had deliberately done wrong.

Whether you're teaching someone else, or teaching yourself, it may be helpful to do it wrong.

**Obligatory clarification edits:**

1. This is intended to be a one-off exercise to **check** understanding. Don't deliberately teach people the wrong method to do this.
2. The key is that the learner is **intentionally** making the wrong move, not accidentally or unknowingly. They must be aware that it is wrong.
3. Don't do this in a real, practical situation. This is a learning and training tip.",LifeProTips

TIFU almost eating my cousin out in her office,"(UPDATE AT BOTTOM!)

This happened yesterday. I can't wait until it's much further away than that.

So this is a throwaway, I have \*(had) another account where I like to post nudes of myself. That can be your judgement, and why I do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but I do. As a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies I get are from guys. But occasionally I get replies from girls who frequent these subs. My face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. Just my... ya know, body.

So I had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. Our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. She said she had some nudes too but she didn't want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. A lot of people in the ""nudes"" community use Kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).

She is from a large city on the other side of the country as I am, but conveniently I was traveling there next week (this week). We started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. She worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. This idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. We decided I would carry an envelope and say its for office ""XXX,"" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. No names needed.

Most importantly we decided we weren't going to exchange face photos...we had already shared WAAAY too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. We literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. And lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.

So along comes yesterday, the big day. I'm so worked up. She's so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. Shows me that she is already masturbating. Etc. Oh lord, etc. I text her and tell her I'm in the building. I get to her office, my heart is racing but I'm beyond excited. I see the receptionist, tell her I need a signature from office ""XXX"" and she points me in the right direction. As I walk up, I see the name on the door. My cousins name. My first cousin, who I have known my whole entire life. My cousin, who I spend every holiday with and am very close with. It can't be, I think.

So I knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. And she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this ""guy"" was going to walk in. I just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say ""Heyyyy Cousin, I was in town and thought I'd stop by!"" She is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says ""OMG COUSIN!"" and gets up to hug me. I literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. She tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we'll get drinks that night.

I race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. She surely thinks this guy ghosted her, I really don't think she thought it was me. Maybe I read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. I'm sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. I don't know really though. I texted her later and told her I was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. We're supposed to get a drink tonight. I'm petrified and don't know how in god's name I will be able to make eye contact with her.


edit:  It's hard to reply to all of the comments, so I'll say some stuff here.  She works for a very large company in a very large city.  She told me what floor to go, I honestly didn't even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    I DO know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if I wanted.  Like I said, it's a big company, and not a shock that I could pop in.

Yes she is on reddit but I highly doubt she will see this post.  She told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.


edit 2:  Headed out for drinks now.  Wish me luck guys.  I think i'm going to be honest.  I don't know.

edit 3:  Well, first of all, Id like to address everyone calling BS on this.  It seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  I agree and would call BS reading this also.   I can't really defend it or prove it (or can I?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, I could give a shit!)

‚Ä¢ She doesn't have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.

‚Ä¢ She lives in NYC, it's big.  The buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. It didn't occur to me, I guess I was worked up.

‚Ä¢ I come here often, it's not that I didn't call her, but sometimes when i'm here she'll dm or comment on my insta story and say ""hey come by and visit next time""

‚Ä¢ In our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  There was no door man or anyone else I needed to get past.  I don't know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.

‚Ä¢ We didn't actually say ""hey cousin"" lol, i'm just censoring our names for the post.

‚Ä¢ Yes guys post nudes to reddit, I would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)

‚Ä¢ I'm 35, she's 26.

‚Ä¢ I deleted my account after freaking out, but I'm sure I'll post again and I'll let you know lol.



oooookay, so now onto drinks.

I decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn't fucking focus on anything else.  And as many of you guessed, she knew. She didn't buy the ""i just popped in"".  She figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that I knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  I assured her I didn't, it was really weird.  We slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  We complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  We talked about if we actually did anything, it's a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  And then we had another drink.  And then I licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  I stroked myself while I did it, and after I made her cum she helped me out.  We promised we would never do this again, but I think we'll get drinks one more time before i leave.

judge away, people.

TIFU By Making a Grown Man Cry at My Work,"I debated whether or not this belongs here cause it's more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. But my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. 

Sidenote: This happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.

I work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. I had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. He was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes I get who tend to speak down to me just because I'm a girl who works in a hardware store. Anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn't have a receipt so I said I could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. He agrees and he opens his wallet and I notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. Trying to make conversation I decide to comment on it:
(OP: Me | OG: Old Guy)

OP: Oh is that your granddaughter? She's so cute!

OG: Oh no... That's my daughter.

*FUCK, I basically just implied this guy was old.*

OG: Oh cool! She's really cute! What grade is she in?

*Guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*

OG: She's dead. She was hit by a car. A week after the picture was taken 

In my mind I FUCKING PANICKED. I literally didn't know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. And this is what I came up with:

OP: Oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! It's too bad she died!

The guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. In record time I get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, ""Have a nice day!"" And he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.

Guys. 

I told him ""you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter"".

And that, ""oh geez, sucks that she's dead!"" That's what my fucking brain came up with. 
FML.

TL;DR - Subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she's dead.

**UPDATE: Holy shit.**

I did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). Appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).

To answer a few comments: 
*Why didn't you just say 'I'm sorry' and move on?*

Because that would of been the smart thing to say and as I have referenced, I am a complete and utter dumbass. Also, I am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so I was trying to backpeddle as fast as I could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.

*Why would you comment on the kids picture? That's weird.*

Yeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. But like I said I am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. This happened when I was still pretty new to the job and I had never worked in retail before so I wasn't really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn't talk about with customers. After this happened I learned my lesson and I have only ever asked how a person's day is going or have made comments about the weather. 

*Why do you work in customer service? You clearly don't belong in that department.*

Like I said this happened a few years ago when I was still pretty new and I have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. I now train people for the job and I am also a assistant supervisor of the department. I usually tell newbies this story when I am training them so they don't make the same mistake as I did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). Also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. 
 
*Did you ever apologize to the guy?*

No, and that's the one thing I regret most of all. I've never seen him come back to the store after this happened. I truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.

Anyway, thanks for reading my post guys. While I'm sure this made some of your cringe, hope y'all have a good day!

AITA for telling people my sister had an abortion.,"I'm 99% sure I'm a megga asshole but I came here to just be sure. 

my sister 23f is a megga pro life advocate, here is the stupid part, I held her hand a year ago when she got her abortion. she never mentions it and I can guarantee that I'm the only one who knew. 

I always feel like she is being super hypocritical because she got an easy access to have an abortion and then wants to take that away from others. 

I was getting sick of seeing her abortion kills babys posts and how she hates pro choice people so I decided to comment on one of her posts. I commented, you where definitely pro life when I held your had last year at the abortion clinic. 

I've now been blocked and she was banned from most of her pro life fb groups.

[UPDATE] Had a falling out with the girl I love and got served a cease and desist order. What can I legally do? [Michigan] (x-post on r/relationships),"Past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

Oh boy. I've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. I wasn't going to, but I know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and I actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and I read all the comments there. It was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. I decided I needed to post again for some closure. I would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

For those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so I'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. I want to take full accountability for everything, so I want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

First, I want to assure everyone that I didn't contact that girl ever again. Since I moved, I no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (I don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. I have avoided getting any information about her at all). The way I acted and the way I hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. Part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but I know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. If she wants to get closure by talking to me, I'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. I don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. I learned in my classes that men do that a lot. I don't want to hurt her anymore, so I will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

I was distraught after my last post here. I admit I came here looking for validation, not help. I had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that I was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that I needed help. All of these people were right. I don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive I was in response to the comments). I checked myself into therapy in Michigan the week after I posted here. I knew something was wrong, but I was still in denial. I thought I needed help with heartbreak. I didn't recognize that I actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that I used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. After a few sessions, I started seeing a psychiatrist too. I got on mood stabilizers and I started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way I was acting. Something that couldn't be cured by medication. After talking it over with my therapist, I decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my Aunt's house. Within a month of me posting here, I had moved into her house. 

After moving, I started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. I had a fresh idea of the issues I wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that I was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in Michigan (though I wasn't stalking anyone at this point, I was just obsessing in my mind. Which is still bad, but I wasn't actively victimizing anyone). I realize that in addition to therapy, I needed more help. My therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. Most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so I signed up voluntarily. I attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. The goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  I know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? People like me. People like me in the last post. I look like a normal person. I grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. Monsters come in all shapes and sizes and I fooled myself by saying because I didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because I wasn't ""like"" the abusers I saw on TV, that I wasn't one. But I am. I can't take back what I've done, but I can promise myself I will never victimize anyone else again. 

In conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. I want to say that I do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. I made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because I thought I had the right to dictate how others interact with me. The class is a year-long class and I have only been in it for a month, but I have already learned so much. I have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. But I believe that since I've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. I've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so I made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. Don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people I am stalking or believe I am in love with (I talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

Thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and I'm sorry for how I decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice I asked for.

**tl;dr**: I ceased, I desisted, and I got mental health help. Thanks to everyone.

**EDIT**: Wow, just wow. I didn't expect this response. I guess this is a top post of all time. 
I wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. I read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though I didn't reply to many. I cried a lot while reading them. 

2. I didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. I'm not sure why I did it, but I don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. I don't know if I deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. But thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. I've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program I am in. The program I am in is specific to my area, so I'd rather not disclose the name. However, I encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" I did some research today about the class I am in and that is what these types of classes are called. They all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. There is no official federal program I don't think.

4. I am not healed. I have a lot of obsessive thoughts and I have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. My meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process I need to change and that cant be done with pills. I have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. I have never had real ""friends"" until the ones I have now. Before Jaime, I definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women I had crushes on and men I wanted to be friends with. It was never as bad as it was with Jaime, but I still am sure I made people uncomfortable.  I also have some self-harm behaviors I am working out. So to the person who was worried that I would use all of the good praise to say ""oh I'm perfect now so I can do what I want,"" trust me, I know I am fucked up and I want to change. I want to have normal relationships and friendships. I want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

Please get help if you need it. Take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",legaladvice

\-----

&#x200B;

Two weeks ago we were two weeks away from getting married.

She asks me to go to therapy with her. She was already seeing a therapist on her own, and wanted me to go with her and have a talk, before the wedding, where we could be completely honest with one another. That sounded a little weird to me, I thought we were already completely honest with one another, after all, we were getting married in two weeks, right?

Also, she was super protective about her therapy sessions, didn't really talk about them. I have never met her therapist. So to be invited there all of a sudden seemed a little out of place to me.

The day comes, and I go there. But out of self preservation, I had my phone opened and recording any audio.

My fiance was already there. I had to wait 20 minutes before I was invited in. The therapist greets me and shakes my hand. We have small talk. She tells me I am not at all the way my fiance described me. I think she is trying to compliment me. Then she looks at my fiance and tells her ""this may be harder than we thought.""

That absolutely weirded me out. But I am a calm and collected individual, and I don't react, just kept that dumb smile on my face we all have in awkward situations.

So the therapist starts talking. Has a small speech I don't care to repeat. My fiance takes my hand as the therapist starts telling me that ""we live in a modern world, and that my fiance wants us to have a non-conventional marriage moving forward.""

I smile, I am not sure what the hell that means, through my mind I am thinking she wants to talk how she will not be a slave to her husband, she will not sacrifice her work life, etc. Modern woman and girl power and all that.

Nope, she is actually talking about how once we get married, she wants to be free to sleep with other men.

The other non-traditional type of marriage. I forgot it's 2018.

But she loves me a lot, and would not be comfortable with me having the same ""benefits"".

Because she would be too heart broken knowing that I find other women attractive and that one of them could steal me from her.

So I let them finish talking. They were very fluent, and they got more confident talking, probably empowered by my lack of reaction, and because I wasn't saying anything. This was definitely something they have rehearsed.

I then asked the therapist if she is licensed. This, by her reaction, was not what she expected to be the first thing coming out of my mouth. She said yes. So I told her to explain to my fiance why we will not be getting married any more, and why we will not continue being a couple starting immediately.

I wished them good luck, and left the office.

Now, I want to report the therapist. I am not sure if I have to report her to the clinic, or is there a board that supervises therapists? I don't think their planning and attempt to corner me is professional conduct, and I want her to pay for the misconduct. That ""session"" did not sit well with me.

To be clear, there would have been no positive outcome to this talk my fiance and the therapist had with me. Even if she wanted a completely open marriage, where I could sleep with other women, the outcome from my part would have been the same. That's is not a marriage, that is a sham.

It also dawns on me, she might have cheated on me. Now that I have this clarity of mind, certain things don't match up.

So I was a fool anyway.

I listened to the recording, and I still can't believe what was said there.

Anyway, I called off the wedding.

I am a very easy going guy, there are no fights with me because I am not seeking them. There are no conflicts, enemies, because my life is guided on principle and common sense. That might have given my ex the impression I will be easy to walk over, like a door mat, but she is an idiot for thinking that. Having listened to the recording a few times, I am confident the therapist recognized I am not how my fiance must have described me in their sessions.

hence the ""this may be harder than we thought.""

Now that the wedding is no longer happening, people are starting to ask questions I am not comfortable answering.

How do I navigate this sea?

I am sure my ex is doing damage control, but I have the recording, and if she goes too far off the path, I will not shy letting people know what she wanted us to talk about.

But my parents and family also want answers, and I am not sure what BS to tell them. I don't want them to think I am an idiot for allowing my ex to get to this point where she was so confident that she straight out told me she wants to fuck other dudes.

She is also blowing my phone, my best friend's phone, my brother's phone.

""We can work on this"", ""I didn't understand what they were telling me in the therapy session"", ""she will do anything to fix this"", ""it was the therapist's idea, she was against it"", etc.

Last cry of a dying siren. All her cries fall on deaf ears, and I am the owner of said ears.

We were also working to get a loan to buy a house, but I cancelled everything.

I basically erased any ties we had financially, or otherwise.

Her current plea is that in therapy she exposed her insecurities about our sexual history. I had considerably more partners than her, and the therapist came up with the idea we should ""level the field"".

Regardless of the truth of this, that therapist gets reported once I figure out where to do it, and what to say.

This post is mostly a rant, but I would also want to know how would you handle the questions of friends and family. My Ex is certainly doing her own damage control, and I don't want to be a he said / she said. I do have the recording, and am wondering if I should send it to the interested parties.

My wife named our son after her first love and I had no idea,"This is my throwaway account because she know my main account. My son is 5. About 2 days ago we were out shopping and ran into a high school friend of hers. She was catching up when she told her friend that we had a son. When the old friend asked his name my wife hesitated and I told her. She had a strange look on her face then said you mean like your ex boyfriend. Our sons name is very unique to the point that I've never met another person with the same name. Now she refuses to talk to me about it. I feel betrayed and disgusted with her. It's like a switch was flipped my mind and I just can't look at her the same way. 











Update 1. Lots of questions so I'll go ahead and answer a few that have been mentioned a few times. I'm not giving out my son's name. When we discussed the name I had no idea it was her high school ex's name. I knew she had one boyfriend in high school who's name was never told to me and their relationship lasted around two years. I'm upset but that doesn't automatically make make me abusive. I would never raise my hand to my wife or anyone else I care about. I will always love my son and I would never and I mean never treat him any differently. I will post an update when I talk to her probably in a day or two




Update 2. So to get some things out of the way first. The kid is mine. I have very pronounced features that he also has plus her ex was black and I'm white. I'm not  going to ""throw him away"" as so many comments suggested. When we were deciding on the name she said she remembered somebody from school who had it and instantly loved it. My wife and I both had a very promiscuous past before we met and agreed that the past should stay there so I didn't push to hard to know certain details. I knew she had one boyfriend in high school who cheated on her but I never asked his name and that is my fault.

So update time. Thursday we didn't have the discussion because that is her late day at work plus this wasn't a discussion I wanted to have with our son in the house. So Thursday night when she came in I told her that Friday after work we needed to sit down and talk and if she has any plans she need to cancel. She looked very worried and said ok. Friday came and we sit down after her sister came to pick up our son for a sleep over. I asked why would not tell me where our name came from? She said she was sorry but she didn't think it was that big of a deal and I would not agree to it. I told her that it was my choice too and she took that away from me. I asked her if she would feel the same way if we had a daughter and named her after one of my ex's and she said that's different I wouldn't let that happen. She said that she knows she can disconnect the name from her ex but she wouldn't be sure I could do the same. I was floored and starting to feel sicker than I had felt. I told her that is one of the stupidest things I have ever heard come out of someone's mouth. I moved on because I had more questions and I was about to go off just on what she just said. I asked her if she still loved him and she paused for a minute then said yes but not in same way she loves me and that you don't just stop loving someone that love changes. I wanted to throw up at this point. She could see that I was very upset. She smiled at me and said I should know she only wants to be with me. I said that I needed to know how you love him. At that point she put her hand on my leg and tried to change the subject. I told her to take her fucking hand off me right now and answer the question. Her mood changed right there from wanting to move past this to no he didn't just fucking cuss at me. She said look you're upset and I get that but what is done is done so you need to get over this and move on. She got up and said I'm meeting my mom dinner I'll see you when you get home. I told her if you walk out that door then no you won't. She looked at me like I was full of shit grabbed her purse and left. I packed my bag and stayed at a friend's house last night. Right now I'm just sitting here trying to figure out what to do next.

Shitting on men for not wanting to have period sex is fucked up,"Woman here, I have been menstruating for many years.

If a man doesn't want to get my blood all over him and have to clean up what looks like a crime scene after we are done, I do not blame him.

"Banned from public unuversity due to false allegations without hearing my side. Banned lifted three weeks after person reda ted all charges and admitted to lying. USA, Washington","Edit: title should say ""redacted"". Sorry for the spelling errors. I didn't spell check before posting.

Edit2: It was a female. It is a title ix investigation
I did speak to a lawyer for 30 minutes who said I didn't have much to fight for. The ""online"" courses were not online. It meant my normal classes that were lecture based could provide me info vis email. It wasn't a set up online course and 4 of my 5 professors didn't have any way to provide online lecture info. And even so, only one class provided me resources. The dean did not provide any info even after emails from me asking for it.

I was banned from campus following allegations against me. I was accused of sexual misconduct and assault charges. The allegations not only never happened but I have never even met this person for longer than 5 minutes at a party.

I was brought into the Dean's office with officers in the room who showed me the charges. I told them I had no idea what they were coming from and I barely know this person. They still issued a no trespassing issue until ""further investigation"".

I was not given any chance to take classes or reach out to any professors. I am a senior and about to graduate. They reached out to me with an option to take classes online for classes with lecture only curriculum. They only gave me info for one class. Then a week later they lifted my no contact ban based on new info. And another week later they entirely lifted my ban due to the person saying they completely lied and the allegations we're not true. Despite this I am still ""under investigation"".

I missed too much class to reasonably still complete. Three full weeks of missed senior level classes. I had to drop out due to this condition.

I was also let go at my prestigious internship because they only hire full time students. 

Because of this I have no school and no job.

The university refused any refund to me upon request and their response was ""the actions were necessary due to the severity of the accusation"" despite never hearing my side.

"It should be illegal for a pregnant woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigs while pregnant, and grounds for removal by child services.","Some may claim this isn't unpopular, but I think it is. Bodily autonomy, no one owning a pregnant woman's body (not even the fetus growing inside of it), the fact that you can't even file a CPS report for a follow up *after* the birth of a child to a woman who drank like a fish her whole pregnancy, or a woman who delivered prematurely due to their nicotine addiction. 

If you are pregnant and intend on carrying and birthing that child, you have a moral and ethical responsibility to make sure that baby is born as healthy as possible. It should be illegal for any woman to drink alcohol or smoke cigarettes while she's growing a developing fetus. 

It should be punishable as felony child abuse or neglect if the child is born with any deformities or developmental issues related to the substance abuse (this is provable with medical expertise), and charged as a misdemeanor if not. At the very least, CPS should be allowed to intervene before the child is born, and remove the child upon birth. 

Edit: For those who keep bring it up, no, weening after a few weeks when you know you're pregnant would not be ground for removal in this scenario. This applies to those who have no intent of quitting, and exhibit no attempt at quitting either behaviors. Common sense would still be applied by CPS. ",unpopularopinion

LPT request : Do not request one hour dry cleaning if you can help it.,"As a dry cleaner, I can tell you that it take an average of 1 1/2 hours for a proper dry cleaning cycle to complete: a double bath (rinse and cleaning with detergent) and a drying cycle. If a dry cleaner is offering an hour service, something was skipped. 
It take an average of 110 seconds to press a pair of pants, so take that into consideration too. That is if all the stains came out on the first try. Most likely, they need to be spot treated on the spotting board by a professional spotter to remove some stubborn stains. And that may or may not need to be cleaned again with pre-spot spray treatments to get that last stain out.
Usually, a dry cleaner who offers  an hour service have to shorten the washing cycle and skip pressing the clothes and just steam them while on a hanger to get them out on time. They have to also make time for tagging, bagging and racking and inputting the order into a computer or some system for pickups.
In summary, dry cleaning itself needs to be done in 45 minutes (2-3 min rinse and 35 mins for drying and the rest for extraction spinning and cool down) and the rest for processing if the staff is on top of things.
Before, it was possible cause Perc was a strong enough chemical to wash like water, but most dry cleaners have switched over to an alternative dry cleaning solvents away from Perc by now, especially in California. 
So if you want your money's worth, do not ask for an hour of dry cleaning. (I've been in the business for 16 years. )",LifeProTips

"I think the glorification of single mothers is getting ridiculous, especially if they're single mothers through their own poor life choices.","So often you hear a woman introduce herself by stating she's a single mother, as if that defines her existence. Are you looking for an award or a medal? Are you trying to play the victim card? Are you trying to state that even though you have a kid you're single? What are you trying to achieve by saying that? Thing is, most people respond with something some sort of comments of adulation, which I do not understand. 

I have vastly more respect for single parents that don't use being a single parent as a crutch or a method for attention grabbing. 

Edit: Some of my replies to comments are getting buried, so I'll clarify a few things:

1. Obviously I'm not talking about widows, etc. I'm talking about those women that made poor life choices and then attempt to virtue signal, especially on social media.

2. Poor life choices include not using at least two methods of birth control during sex. If birth control is not your priority, you should not be having sex. 

3. If you do create a child, it is your duty to raise them, whether alone or with someone else. You don't deserve a medal for it.

"LPT: Got a friend or family in the hospital? Consider giving them cozy blankets, soft socks, open toe slippers, book/eReader reader, long phone charger, and condiments for food instead of flowers.","Note: *This is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title.*

I was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life. This made me realize what I would have loved to have based on my six-night stay.


**Warm, comfortable blanket (microfleece)**- Hospital HVACS systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely. I was told they could only bump it up or down here at my VA hospital. Also, this was the first time I received an IV treatment and let me tell you they are cold... Had an IV in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and I am pretty convinced I could put a fan on it to air condition the room.


**Warm, comfortable socks**- Reasons are similar to the blanket explanation. Maybe socks with gripping pads wouldn't be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes.  *Credit*: /u/Getitgirl007 mentioned that their family/friends had received socks from the hospital, so I followed up and asked my nurse about this.  Turns out, the VA hospital does have socks available and my new RN was shocked that no one had offered them to me ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


**Condiments** - I believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patient's stomach. This problem might be compounded by medication. May have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely. **EDIT** I recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it.  Generally, it would be wiser to consult with the RN or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption.  


**Open toe slippers**- Luckily I had flip flops on when I was unexpectedly admitted for my infection. Making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if I only had tennis shoes. Probably would of went barefoot in that case.  


**Long, braided phone charger** - My wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great. I can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldn't get in the nurse's way. I recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience. Also, I am using a 5ft USB hub for my charger, the extra length is nice to have.


**Entertainment**: A book, eReader, word games, or anything to help pass the time.   The TV service may offer on-demand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration. Another option might be to get your patient a google/apple card so they cam purchase some movies. If they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed. The gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference. *EDIT* /u/stjernDale recommended audiobooks.  Great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes! 


**Gift Cards**: *Credit: /u/1900grs, /u/HalftimeHeaters.*  Gift cards for local restaurants (especially with delivery service) and gas stations are terrific.  


*Bonus LPT*:  /u/1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers, balloons, and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients.  They take up quite a bit of valuable real-estate, make it difficult for hospital staff to work, and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge.  This bonus LPT is intended for *adult patients.*


Edit 1

**Power Bank**- /u/nintynineninjas recommended a power bank to charge your phone when you are unable to move.  This was especially helpful for when they were locked down from holding their newborn.


Edit 2

**Eye Mask & Ear plugs** - /u/Ruaidiri, /u/perpetuallywet, /u/SuedeVeil recommended these items due to minimizing the constant distractions or getting some much-needed rest.  Especially useful for patients who are sharing rooms in the maternity ward.

**Moisturizers & Chapstick** - /u/jessicasanj, /u/FatJennie, /u/bluephoto recommended these items.  I will have to admit that my hands were getting pretty dry from constant washing.",LifeProTips

"WIBTA if I played ""Another One Bites the Dust"" at my brother's wake?","My brother died. He was an incredible, funny guy, I miss him like I lost one of my limbs. Maybe it's stupid, but I want people to remember the person he was. My dad and aunts have been involved in planning his funeral and they have been planning a very Catholic funeral service. He wasn't Catholic and wouldn't like the very expensive casket, the flowers, the church with a lot of people he didn't know there. He'd think it's way too fancy, way too much. 

He and I had morbid discussions a lot (side effect of me being a goth teenager, I guess). He told me he wanted to be cremated and his ashes thrown into a ceiling fan while ""It's Raining Men"" played in the background...obviously not an option....Also, together we made up a funny funeral playlist, including songs like ""Highway to Hell"" and ""Another One Bites the Dust."" 

To remember him, I want to bring a speaker and play ""Another One Bites the Dust"" at his wake. I would explain it to the people at the wake and say that I wanted to preserve the person he was. Maybe I could give a speech, or tell the story and explain how he saw death with humor, not sadness. There will be a lot of extended, older family members there who weren't very familiar with him and are Catholic, so I've been thinking maybe not. But I really want to preserve his memory as he was, not what people think he should have been. I think my cousins and sister would get a kick out of it. 

WIBTA?

Edit: I didn't really expect this response, but thank you. My brother would have been absolutely thrilled by all of your comments. I swear, I almost sense his hand in it. I don't know if anyone will see this update, but here goes, 

This morning, I talked to my dad about the wake. I suggested, as some of you did, that maybe I could give a eulogy and talk about my brother, and then play a instrumental cover of the song. I found a violin one that I really liked. My dad listened to the cover and looked at the list that my brother and I made. He actually smiled and laughed, and said that it seemed like a great idea. I hadn't really been thinking about my Dad as much as I should have, I thought of him as opposition, I guess he cared way less about the Catholic stuff than I thought. 

I also reached out to some of my brother' s friends. Some of them had already been planning a party in his honor and they were happy to listen to some of my ideas. We are going to play all the songs on the list, plus a few others that apparently he told his friends about and not me, and we're going to start working on logistics for scattering (not human!) ashes from a ceiling fan.

Well some time has passed.. And a lot has happened. My first post had a lot of comments and I got some PM's from people asking me what went down so that's why I'm updating.

So I didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because I realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. I didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and I shouldn't have done that. But I needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever I was going to decide would change my life so I needed some space, though I could have communicated a bit more (which I'm working on now).

Anyways, I realized that I'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. I was stuck on the age gap, I kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when I thought of her. Some comments really stuck with me and I decided to just trust my feelings. I ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. She was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how I felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. I'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. She completely lit up when I told her, I saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. She was ecstatic, I won't ever forget that. 

Every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. I really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. We talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and I don't understand how it has all been so amazing. I know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. I moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, I had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. She has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. They got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. On top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl I've introduced them to. The pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. I'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, I'm really close with my parents. They are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. They fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

She's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. I've been trying to help her and support her any way I can, and did a TON of reading online to understand what's going on. I offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that I can keep going. We need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

So yeah... I'm going to a dad. She's gonna give birth to our kid.. Still feels surreal to me, but I'm low-key kinda excited. It'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. I'm happy that I'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

"My Fianc√©e isn't speaking to me after I used ""our"" money to help my dog. Not sure not to fix this?","My dog (German Shepard) began acting strangely a few months ago. First couple vet visits didn't show anything until eventually we felt a large lump under his fur which was later identified as a tumor. It was confirmed to be malignant and required surgery to remove completely. 

The vet I spoke to said it would likely cost over $5000 to remove it completely and there's no guarantee it will be a success. I don't know why the cost was so high, but it didn't matter to me. My dog is my dog and there is no question in my mind that paying for the surgery was the right thing to do. 

I paid for the surgery out of my own savings. This is important. My fianc√©e and I have separate finances and my savings are easily 5x what she had saved up. When she found out how much the surgery cost, she went ballistic that I paid for the surgery without asking her when we're planning a wedding. She says that she will have to downsize her wedding to compensate, and that my dog is already so old (10) the money ""wouldn't go far."" I can't even comprehend how she could say that to me.

I honestly can't empathise with her here, which has caused a massive rift in a previously amazing relationship. My dog is my dog and he's a member of the family. I refuse to put a few thousand dollars over his well-being. My fiancee is acting as though I'm being selfish and that our wedding should come first, since we're starting a family.

She hasn't talked to me since other than to tell me to take out the garbage, clean the dishes, etc. If I try to engage conversation she will shut down or walk away. She refuses to talk this over unless I get on my knees, grovel and apologise. I can't bring myself to do this as a matter of principle and self respect.

So my question for people here is how am I supposed to get her to talk to me and patch things up? I don't want to throwaway the relationship, but at the same time I feel this is something I cannot compromise on...",relationship_advice
AITA for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?,"New to reddit, please bare with. 

So I (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. Up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

However, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. She and I have quite a lot in common, and I actually like spending time with her. However it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. Now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; I'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. However, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if I want coffee. I sleep naked. Every time prior to the last one, I've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. I always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but I didn't"". 

When she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, I intentionally slept on top of the covers. Sure enough, she barges in at 7AM, begins to ask if I want coffee and sees my you-know-what. She immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. My mate later pulled me aside and said I was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that I'd ""threatened"" to do it before (I literally just said ""okay but what if I had no covers and you saw everything"" before). They're now framing this to others that I'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how I get my rocks off, and I'm kinda seeing how it came off that way.

"AITA for breaking up with my girlfriend over ""consent required""?","Before any of you start freaking out at me, I want to say that I fully support both women and men asking for consent before getting touchy or sexual with another person, and I would never in my life think about treating another person that way. Now that thats out of the way, the AITA moment.  

I've been with my girlfriend for the last 8\~ months.  In this time, we've slept together, been sexual together, and all that jazz.  We've hit a comfortable routine where on friday nights one of us would go to the others place and spend the weekend there.  Our usual routine on the first night is watching some shitty movie or tv show until we realize we don't actually care what we're watching and would much rather make out.  This goes on until one of us decides to start pawing at each others genitals like a cat pawing the bottom of the door while you're trying to use the bathroom.  Things lead into foreplay followed by the usual sex times.   This has been our almost weekly routine for a good 3 months now.  We've been comfortable with each other and very open about our sexual desires and what not.

Now, on this last friday, I went over to her apartment.  We put on some stupid netflix documentary that I can't remember the name of, and about half way through we started tongue boxing.  I got into it, and decided to start touching her, resulting in me getting under her pants.  I do the business and make her feel good.  After this, we just sit there for a minute in the after glow, before she pulls away from me and goes kind of silent.  I try to talk to her because I can tell somethings suddenly upset her but have no idea what, she tries to tell me that nothings wrong.  I tell her that I know when shes upset and if she's not willing to talk with me about it then I should probably just go, so she breaks down and says this.

""I just feel like you kind of use me.  You never ask for my consent before touching me and it makes me feel like an object instead of a person.""

Now, of course I understand the sentiment.  I'm not always the most romantic of person, I try to make her feel good and give 110% to her, but I can see where shes coming from.  Still, I was \[visibly confused\] at this statement, and she must have noticed because she huffed and pulled away again and said that I never listen to her.

I point out how we've been dating for months, and that neither of us has asked for consent to touch the other since we first started dating and were just starting to be sexual towards one another.  She gets mad at this and says how it isn't the same for a woman as it is a man.  I tell her how blatantly a double standard that is.  

At this point shes getting angry and borderline yelling at me about this, and says that I'm no longer allowed to touch her in any way unless I ask first and she gives me permission.

I say that it makes no sense for us to be dating and in a romantic relationship if she expects me to walk on eggshells just to try and be intimate with her, and say that shes making me feel like I'm some kind of molester or sexual offender because I want to touch the woman I've been dating for 8 months.

""Well maybe you are!"" she says angrily.  At this point, I'm angry, annoyed, and absolutely fed up.  I just say that if thats the way things need to be with her then maybe we just should break up.  She throws a fit over this and starts insulting me, at which time I just leave and go home.

Not five minutes after I walk in my door, shes texting me saying that shes sorry for insulting me and yelling at me, I think it over for a minute and decide that I'm done, text her back that we're through, and go to bed.

&#x200B;

I woke up in the morning to almost 50 texts, most from her either being apologetic or angry, the rest being from friends of hers or her sister calling me an asshole because I ""broke up with the perfect woman because I wasn't allowed to grope her whenever I want.""

So, Am I the asshole here?  I feel like I'm justified in my reaction and opinions regarding this, but at the same time feel like maybe theres some new wave promoting the virtue of consent that I've missed?  Am I the asshole for thinking that you shouldn't need to ask for consent to touch or feel your partner if you're in a romantic relationship?  

&#x200B;

And before you start yelling at me (even though I'm sure half of you have already started typing) I respect a persons right to say no.  If I touch my girlfriend, or any girl I'm with sexually/romantically for that matter, and they say they aren't interested or aren't in the mood, I'll stop, no question.  I just think requiring consent every time is insane and more damaging to the relationship than anything.  ",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by showing my cat a plushie that looks like her,"At the office today, there was a raffle for some stuffed animal toys and I won one. I chose one that looked almost exactly like my cat thinking I'd get a cute photo of them together.

I get home and put the toy on the bed next to her and snap a photo. She doesn't care, but hey, mission accomplished. 

Fast forward 6 hrs and I'm playing Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. I suddenly hear my cat howling up a storm and look over to the bed and she is crying at the stuffed version of herself. She's picking it up by the neck, dragging it around, setting it down, staring into its lifeless eyes, and just crying nonstop. 

I take it away from her but she doesn't stop howling. Her fur is all puffed up and her eyes look so scared. I think she thought it was a dead cat. I open the door to my room and she bolts out and starts cowering in the furthest corner of the apartment from my room. She won't let me near her.

I feel like a villain. I love her more than anything and now she's fearing for her life.

Tldr; I brought a stuffed cat toy home for my cat. She thought I brought her a dead cat and freaked out.

AITA for telling the cashier to fuck off and subsequently demanding her to get her manager because she had a condescending attitude towards me buying condoms?,"I'm really, really pissed off at this girl I just encountered and idk if I'm just being an immature teen or if I'm justified.  Basically I went to the Walmart down the street because I needed condoms. I'm 16 and have been told I have a baby face but I guess that's just how it is.

The condoms are locked behind a cabinet thing I guess because of theft or something idk but I asked a lady who was on shift, but wasn't doing anything if she could open it up. She made a comment ""Aren't you a little young to be needing those young man"" which really caught me off guard and I sorta just stammered and studdered and kinda embarrassed myself and I just mumbled again that I needed them. 

She basically made a condescending exaggerated ""hmfph"" noise and said ""I outta really call your mama and tell her what you're doing instead of helping you act a fool; you know you don't need to be using these"" before moving towards the condoms. My mom and I go shopping here often so while I personally didn't know this lady, it's not unlikely that she has seen me walk in here with her

Here's where IDK if I'm TA because she WAS getting the condoms, but her threat pissed me off and she was being such a huge bitch the entire way that I basically aggressive said ""it's none of your business for why I need these, fuck off and do your job"". She was taken aback at this point and people started to stare and she was like ""excuse me?"" and I said ""you heard what I said"". 

She said I'm not going to be doing anything and I needed to watch my mouth and she's not going to get anything for anyone with that kind of attitude and that's when I got really mad because she was wasting my time and humiliating me in front of the entire store and so I said ""Give me a manager if you don't want to do your fucking job then"" and she stammered before refusing, so I ended up asking another employee. 

Long story short I ended up getting the condoms, but I'm still so mad and upset that she essentially humiliated me in front of the entire store and my heart's been racing the entire day. Did I handle the situation badly? AITA?",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by hiding in my girlfriend's room while her parents are home,"As the title says, I am currently fucking up by being in my girlfriend's room. 

You may be thinking she's here with me, scared to be caught, but she's not. In fact she's nowhere near me, because she's at school.

My girlfriend and I live about an hour away from each other and she has school so you can imagine seeing each other is not the easier thing right away. My girlfriend also lives with her parents, and she's Asian, meaning no boyfriend until college (though her mom seems okay with it).

On Wednesday we developed a plan to have me sleepover her house without getting caught. The plan was simple, I would come when her parents were gone at work (they own a restaurant) and I would leave in the morning when her dad takes her to school because her mom would still be sleeping.

It went great, I made it out, even ran to my car which wasn't necessary because by the time her dad was coming back I was driving out of her neighbourhood. 

Fast forward to that night and I end up going back over. Thursday goes good, I go to her room in the morning and end up going back to sleep until she comes home. 

Now it's Friday morning. Her dad almost caught us because he wanted to take the recycling out but she quickly got it for him. Then she leaves, I lock her bedroom door and settle in her bed where I'll be for the next 7 hours waiting for her to come back. 

Her dad comes back, comes upstairs, tries to open the door. Fuck. It's locked. He pauses, turns the light on, I assume he looks in her brother's room, then tries the door again. Still locked for obvious reasons he does not know about. He says something to himself (I don't speak Chinese but I really wish I did), then goes back downstairs where he sleeps on the couch.

I text girlfriend, almost dying because of how scared I am to get caught. She tells me to chill, tells me they don't have keys to their doors, the only way to open it is to take the handle off. She texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. Her dad doesn't always listen so that worries me.

Pretty sure her dad went back to sleep now, and her mom isn't awake. Now I'm currently laying in her bed wide awake, texting her, asking my parents what to do (have had similar experiences and got caught), and trying not to freak the fuck out because I can't do anything.

Escaping is impossible. Her window has blinds and a screen and is second story. Going downstairs and out the door is foolish, her dad sleeps on the couch and the stairs are noisy. Plus I have no idea what time her mom wakes up.

I have no choice but to sit it out for the next 7 hours, maybe try to get some rest but I doubt I will. Anyone have any advice? She's 19, I'm 20, her parents don't even know she has a boyfriend.

I imagine they'll be beyond pissed if they find out I'm here, we'll both be fucked. Not only is she dating me but I'm staying in her house without them knowing. It's scary to think there could be someone in your house and you wouldn't even know it, I feel bad for doing this but I love my girlfriend and I'm literal melted butter in her hands.

Update: probably should have gotten up with her right away but chose to stay in bed... now I have to poop really badly. About 6 more hours to go though. Rip my bowels and my asshole. Also for some reason everything in her house fucking creaks, so I have to be very careful with what I do on the bed, sleeping position wise.

Update 09:54 am, about 5 more hours: I still have to poop, not as badly though. However a new probably has arose. I grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of Hawaiian bread. I ate the egg obviously because I can't really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. Tummy feels a bit weird. Hope I don't throw up because it's very hard to be silent while your guts spill on the floor. Also think of napping but too afraid I'll let out a massive fart or make some noise. Girlfriend stopped replying due to class. I've given up the idea of escaping a long while ago. The dad is of no concern, pretty mid level threat but low for now. Mom is high level once she wakes up though. Hopefully she'll leave for work but it looks like that might not happen as she isn't awake yet and supposedly would leave at 10:30. 

Quick update 09:55am: mom is awake and went downstairs, I think she'll make breakfast or something. Dad is talking to mom, don't know what about. Hope they don't try the door again, really feel like I'm gonna shit and throw up now.

Good update 10:03 am: good news, pretty sure the mom just left, pretty sure I can hear her dad snoring. I can finally relax a little. Might actually catch some shut eye. Off to play a bit of fifa mobile and then maybe sleep for a few hours.

Okay another update since it was asked for: 10:20 am, mom's long gone for sure, dad's asleep, not snoring but I'm pretty sure he's sleeping. Unfortunately girlfriend hasn't answered texts for the last two hours I think. Finally beat a team in fifa after playing them for the 20th time. Every time the air conditioner turns on it makes this loud ass noise so every time that happens I get spooked. I'm glad everyone is getting a good laugh out of it. Someone thought this post was fake, which is fine. Not really sure how to prove it's real. As I said before hiding under the bed is impossible, the only place to hide is her closet which will be a tight squeeze. Hoping it doesn't come to that. Dad will probably sleep all day, as he stays up all night talking to his friends in China so his body is in another time zone. Might just nap when the girlfriend comes home as she usually naps after class. Thanks for the good luck. See you in an hour or when something interesting happens. 

Updated 11:40 am: hello, my girlfriend knows this exists now so hello, enjoy my pain and these comments. So far dad's still asleep, mom is at work, AC still spooks me. Here's some answers to questions: gf's birthday is late, yes dad works but ""he can't handle work"" so he goes later (around 6 I think?), and I'll make it clear now I'm not planning to escape, it would be stupid. I truly think gf's dad doesn't care enough to try and bust down the door. Also yes, Florida is a Stand Your Ground are but dad doesn't own guns, just knives (I feel like I could run faster, used to play soccer and have been practicing boxing for years and more recently muay thai so I know how to run and fight). To those asking for proof, if you tell me how to upload a pic then I'd have no problem doing that. As for my poop situation, I still have to go but it's not that bad anymore. Yes I have a bit or orange and bread left, and I have headphones that are supplying me with some nice Spotify service. Also, I played campaign mode in fifa, finally beat chapter 2 after 3 days. See you in an hour. 

Not really an update but I'll post link to gf and I'd texts and her room door (had to reupload bc her face was exposed) [proof reddit](https://imgur.com/gallery/9Pv91je) 

Update AGAIN: uhhhhh I didn't see a post that got deleted. I deleted the link to the pic bc it had her face in it, but I uploaded a new pic and posted the link up above. If this shit is deleted then uhhhh what the fuck reddit you wanna fight? As for my bowels, still gotta go but not as badly. I'm probably going to watch some YouTube or Netflix, since sleeping isn't a good idea. I'll update in an hour as always. 

UPDATE: try using your phone to view. Anyway GOOD NEWS. As we speak I am shitting in the toilet. Dad left. Pooping has never felt so good. I'll update you when my girlfriend comes back.

Update: girlfriend is home, I pooped as soon as the dad left. Yes I know it's stupid staying longer but now that my girlfriend is home I'm safe. For those who are asking why didn't I leave when I got the food, there was a very tiny window to do things, and I didn't have my bag packed. There will be one more update after this when I get home, the true safe zone. As for now the girlfriend and I are going to play fifa and chill until I have to leave. 

FINAL UPDATE: hello I am at my house in bed, nowhere near my girlfriend's parents. I have pooped twice, it went well thank you for asking. About my girlfriend's age,,, she went to school in China at first, and has a late birthday, therefore she's making up credits and will be going to actual uni soon. She's not finished university and gotten a degree, therefore, NO BOYFRIEND. For those of you saying she's an adult her parents don't control her... they do. As long as she lives there and they support her financially. Not to mention she isn't white... She's Asian (Chinese specifically). I myself am Italian/Cuban, so the same rules go for me until I move out (planning to before the end of next year).  Many of you ask why I didn't leave when her dad left to pick her up, instead pooping. First off I had to poop so badly. Secondly I won't see her for awhile, and recently she got hurt so I've been helping tend to her wounds so she doesn't need to go to the hospital (mom's a nurse, taught me everything since I was young). I wanted to be there for her in person. Also yes, her parents own a restaurant. I won't post anymore updates (99.9% chance I won't bc it's over) but will reply to DM's and replies :)

Final permanent update: yes it's about almost a year later, she broke up with me a few months ago. I'm glad you all enjoyed my pain lmao just wanted to write this just in case anyone comes back to read this and is wondering what happened almost a year later. I'm currently happy, perhaps have a bit of a thing going on with a different girl, I'm mentally and physically better than when I did this stupid shit. I will never do this again, and I don't suggest anyone else does it, I had about 5 heart attacks throughout the whole thing and it was a shitty thing to do, if I was the dad and found out I would be beyond pissed. Sorry Mr.Ex's Dad. Yeah, I hope everyone is doing well, I'm doing better, enjoy your day/night :)

Thinking about abandoning pregnant GF...,"My GF is pregnant and I was really excited to be a dad when I first got the news. Problem is we went to prenatal screening and found out there is a high risk of Down syndrome. A follow up diagnostic test confirmed the baby has Down syndrome.

I want an abortion because I am not prepared to raise a child with Down syndrome. This is not me bashing Down syndrome people by the way, it's just not something I'm prepared to do. My GF doesn't want an abortion though so there's nothing I can do about that.

At this point I'm considering just ending the relationship. I'd pay whatever I'm required to by law, but otherwise move on with my life. My GF obviously decides whether to take the pregnancy to term, but I feel like I have a right to leave given how immensely different a child with Down syndrome is as far as responsibilities and future grand children.

Anyway, I'm asking for advice about how to break the news to my GF. I obviously have to tell her ASAP so that she can make an informed decision.  But I don't want to come across as manipulative.

I realise I'm coming across like a heartless prick here, but I genuinely care about my GF and want to do this in the best way possible for her emotionally",relationship_advice
I adopted a dog. They said they gave me the wrong dog even though the photos match. Now the adoption clinic is trying to sue me.,"I live in Texas and I recently adopted a puppy from a humane society several hours from my house. Before arriving I paid the adoption fees via a phone call and then arrived and filled out adoption papers for the good girl. However the next day the clinic called and said that they had accidentally given me the wrong dog and that I needed to return her as some other family had also filled out the adoption papers for her to which I refused. they then said they were going to press legal action on the basis of ""stolen property"" if I didn't return with her within 24 hours. The dog I adopted is clearly the dog within the online photos that were posted for her and they handed her over to me without checking her chip..They said that they could be sued if I didn't bring her back and they didn't check the tags so are they not at fault for giving out the wrong dog?

The puppy I adopted is clearly the same as the one in the photos posted online and I've already bonded with her, taught her tricks and introduced her to my entire family over the last several weeks she's been staying with me. They say that even if I return her they still want me to pay their attorneys fees. Please help me anyone I don't want to lose my dog and I don't feel like I'm at fault for their mistakes.

It's an incredible help to me to be receiving many different perspectives on the scenario as well as slightly reaffirming to know that many believe the courts would be sympathetic to my stance in the situation.

Tifu by telling my gf to go right.,"I finally get to post a fuck up. Happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.

My gf and I were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. Awful game by the way. Anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. The gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.

The star was right in front of her at the crossroad. 

As she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.

Which she immediately did.

I have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and I've worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. Nor have I ever been so afraid. She ended the game with 0 stars...

""I will kill you in your sleep"" she stated.

The rest of the game was spent in dread. Its now 3am and I'm hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.

Goodbye.

Tl;dr Mario Party 7 is a terrible game.",tifu
Coworker/boss is threatening to spread revenge porn of me if I don't have sex with him.,"So a guy I know work with somehow found revenge porn of me online. I thought I had gotten it all taken off the internet after a previous relationship but I guess he somehow found the video. We work in the finance industry and I do a lot of write ups and accounting for the firm. The guy is technically my boss, but he's about my age and it's always been more of a coworker relationship.

This is also because I went to high school with him, and we were preety good friends.

So, last week he calls me into his office and tells me, I'll just call myself H, he found revenge porn of me online. At first I was relieved that it was him cause I've known him for so many years and thought I could trust him. Then he goes behind me and puts his hands on my brests, thrusts his groin into my back and tries to kiss me on the neck. Horrified I push him away. He then tells me that he's had a crush on me forever and he'll delete the video if I come over to his place and have sex with him. Other wise he will upload it to every website he knows and share the link with my family and friends.

We're from the same town and used to be good friends so he knows preety much knows all my relatives and friends. That day I just went home and sobbed the whole night. 

He's told me that I should come over to his place and have sex with him next weekend since he's doing me a favor. Over the past few days he's cornered me and tried to touch me in inappropriate areas and has also been sending me inappropriate emails from a random account.

I feel so betrayed, since I thought we were good friends. and I'm definitely not naive enough to think he'll stop. I've been very depressed and suicidal the last few days.

If anyone else has dealt with this, how did you deal with a situation like this?

Tl;Dr- Coworker found revenge porn of me online. He's been sexually harassing me and Is threatening to share it if I don't have sex with him.

Edit- Many people are telling me to go to the police. It's sadly not as simple as going to the police for me. He is from a very wealthy family that practically owns the company. He's told me he will sue me for false claims, make it impossible to find work and spread the video to everyone I know if I don't have sex with him. 
Also he's left no text messages, and all emails have been from random temp accounts. I'm truly dealing with a sociopath with a lot of resources, connections and money.

TIFU by helping a friend,"A friend knocked on my door today. I don't know him too well, he's the father of one of my son's friends. He seemed quite urgent, so I let him in. He asked if I had a scanner, as he needed something scanned and emailed to him straight away. I sure did!

I invited him into my office. Placed the first page into the scanner. Sat down. Opened my graphics software, and declared ""It's easy! Watch!"".

Unfortunately the software displayed the last image I was working on; a close-up of my erect penis.

It was a decent photo actually. Great lighting. Good composition. A nice angle, too! I don't HAVE many of those pics, I just took one recently as someone asked for it, and uncharacteristically, I felt like obliging.

Two thoughts went through my head;

1. CLOSE IT (which I did)
2. Will he think I've been checking out dick pics, and that I'm gay?!

Now, #2 is not an issue. I am not, and I don't care if anyone thinks I am. However... recently he's been inviting me to a lot of kids' events, and asking questions like ""are you dating?"", ""what do you think of Helen?"" (name changed for privacy reasons). So I've been wondering if HE is that way inclined, and perhaps had his eyes on me....

So... I then compounded things.

To stop him thinking that I'd been looking a close-up pics of other men's penises.. I confidently said ""That was me!"".

He looked around, said ""I think someone called me"", and left.

&#x200B;

EDIT: There have been a lot of questions! So here are some clarifications;

1. I didn't scan my penis. I scanned his paper documents.
2. I took the photo of myself with a DSLR+tripod
3. The photo editing I did on the photo of myself was limited to cropping (removing background stuff) and resizing the image itself (from \~4000px to \~2000px).
4. All 3 people mentioned in this story are single. We all live in the same townhouse complex.
5. The software I use (paint.net) is used both for the editing (cropping, resize) and for acquiring images from my flatbad scanner
6. No, unless we have a pre-existing relationship, you can't see the photo. Thanks for asking, though!
7. This happened at my home office. 

TL;DR accidentally showed a neighbour a close-up photo of my erect penis, then proudly said ""that was me!""",tifu

My (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before I get married.,"My fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. We decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. Everything was going great. He seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

I am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and I wasn't fussed so I agreed to saving it. He has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. I laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. No turns out he was dead serious. He wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know I am still 'pure'.

I told him fat chance I am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. He said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much I love him and that I have nothing to hide anyway as I am still a virgin. I left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

I want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. But at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and I dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

As a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago I decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. For breakfast I made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. I make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. I mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. I have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

It was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. She started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where I told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (She thinks apple pie is healthy???) My mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but I really think I was making an honest effort to help? I feel bad for yelling at my mom but I dunno, was I really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**EDIT:** I really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. I just want to emphasize that I'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, I just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. I will try to be more self-informed in the future. I've taken note of her possibly having ARFID, thyroid problems, or PCOS and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. Also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, I feel bad that I've made such a horrible impression of her. She has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( Also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, I made a comment on this post detailing how I did the cheese sauce and stuff. Thank you very much for your suggestions, I really appreciate them.

**EDIT 2**: My mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. According to the doctor my sister is at risk for Type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU by broadcasting porn to my son's room.,"This happened to me 30 minutes ago and I didn't know what to do some I am going to chronicle it here.

It all started with my son asking if I could use AirPlay to stream some League of Legends games to his T.V. since Worlds are going on. I was reluctant at first since it was almost his bedtime, however I figured what the hell I do things like that all the time so I should go ahead and let him watch until 12ish. He tells me what games he wants to watch and I set up the connection and explain to him that I would let him stay up until 12, however he isn't to tell his mom because she would kill me since his bed time is 10.

My wife works from home and does most of her work at night while everyone is in bed because me and my son are ""loud and obnoxious"". At the time of the incident she is in her office, which is across the hall from my son's room, with the door locked while she is working. I was watching some Carnival Row and I said to myself ""self, now is an opportune time to stroodle the ole noodle. I pull out my phone and go to my incognito mode, ;) gotta be safe, and precede to search me out a suitable video. After a few minutes of searching I found some material and decided to go ahead and start it while I gathered the appropriate tools for the job. I press play and lay my phone on the bed and go grab some lotion and tissues. I jump back into bed placed my items beside of me and reached for my phone. That is when I realized it. I am panicking, FUCK FUCK FUCK, across my screen it has airplay and my son's T.V. was selected. 2 minutes has passed in the video and I thought ok maybe nothing has showed yet so I change it back to league and started to gather myself to go talk to him.

That is when I hear it. My wife is screaming to the top of her lungs and I hear my son pleading with her and I here him say something about dad (you little tattle tale). She is on a war-path now. uh oh. I start panicking ""oh shit oh shit oh shit"" it is like getting caught watching porn by your own mom. Then things go silent and I know she is coming for me I hastily throw the tissues and lotion under the bed and roll over and try to pretend I went to sleep. She kicks the door open, and I pressing my head through my pillow at this moment. She screams my name. My mind went blank and I made a snoring sound. That was probably the real fuck up. I heard her say, ""oh this bitch going to pretend to be asleep, ok ok."" I decided I needed to answer her or I am a dead man. I rolled over and said ....yea? At this point I am waiting for her to make like a cartoon and turn into a steam whistle. She precedes to chew me a new one. To paraphrase something like ""here I am working then I hear people fucking across the hall and come to find out your streaming porn to his room, blah blah irresponsible, blah blah dumbass, blah blah sleeping on the couch"". She storms off and I heard her office door slam. I gather a blanket and my pillow and go to the couch, my son's door is shut and I don't want to press my luck as I walk by. I head to the couch and thought you know this needs to go to TIFU and here I am. Hopefully she doesn't smother me in my sleep lol.

Thanks for the silver and gold kind strangers, you honor me. WoW and platinum, thanks a lot. :D

Edit/update 1: WoW, woke up and this post really blew up. Wife woke me up this mourning so we could talk about what happened lol. She wasn't upset by the porn, she was upset because she thought our son had porn blasting on his T.V. at 12 at night while he was suppose to be asleep and interrupting her work. Which escalated when she found out that I told him he could stay up until 12 and I, in fact, was the one who did the Porn streaming. Which escalated when she opened the door and I was pretending to be asleep. One thing I wanted to address is that she is by no means a bitch, she is an amazing and wonderful woman that just lost her cool. We have all been there at some point. We don't have an abusive relationship. She is the authoritarian in the house and I am a bit of a goofball, however we are fine with that as we rarely have a disagreement and compliment each other very well.

Update 2: Talked to my son while taking him to school and he finds the situation hilarious and can't wait to tell his friends. When I told him I can't believe he threw me under the bus he told me I would do the same and he is right.

Update 3: Sorry I have no intention of linking the ""sauce"" some mysteries are better left unsolved.

TL:DR I was using Airplay to stream videos to my sons room while he was suppose to be sleeping, decided to spank it and accidentally streamed porn to my son's room while my wife was right across the hall from him.",tifu
[Update] MI Boss won't pay after I keft my job,"Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/arxpqm/mi_old_boss_is_withholding_last_paychecks_until_i/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

So I would like to thank everyone that gave me advice on how to help. It helped ease my mind greatly. Now, on to the details!

Following what everyone suggested, I went to LARA (Licensing and Regulatory Affairs) and reported my old place of employment for not paying me around a month worth of checks after I left. I tried one last time to get my money from my old boss. When I asked him why he wouldn't give it to me he said and quote ""You fucked me over, now I'm going to fuck you over.""

That royally pissed me off. I felt hopeless when I read that. Knowing someone intentionally was hurting my personal funds because I left his company. A shame. But that's when I found out I was still apart of their email system.

Now I know this sounds bad, but they kept payroll on the email and I was looking to see if they were even planning in paying even though LARA was just about to begin investigating.

This is when I heard from the IRS saying I was misclassified as a sub contractor when I was really supposed to be a W-2 employee. I found my records in the email and sure enough, I signed a W-2 when I started.

Essentially the investigation ended up concluding and my old boss has to pay LARA back along with some hefty fines. His shop is actually set to close in a matter of weeks. Karma is a bitch.

Thank you all again!",legaladvice
TIFU by adding my colleagues breast milk to my coffee.,"This happened about 45min ago. Some background info: my colleague, let's call her Karen, just got back from mat leave and apparently has been proactively emptying her jugs at lunch time using a breast pump.

So about an hour ago, I started fixing up my daily post-lunch cup of joe when I opened the staff fridge. To my horror there was no more dairy (typically myself and another colleague take turns  supplying cream/milk for the entire office because we're the heavy coffee drinkers). After shuffling around food for 30seconds or so, on the back shelf, I saw a bottle (not quite a baby bottle) filled with some kind of milk. Now I wasnt about to drink my coffee black like some kind of psychopath, so without any hesitation, I grabbed the bottle and loaded my coffee up. Despite the coffee tasting a hint more sweet, I thought nothing of it.

15min later, cue Karen going into the fridge and noticing her bottle has moved. Not just that, her superhuman attention to detail has noticed the bottle isnt as full as before and proceeds to go on a witch hunt around the office, yelling ""who the fuck drank my breast milk???"".

TL;DR unknowingly added my colleagues breast milk to my afternoon cup of Joe and am now hiding in shame as my colleague is on a witch hunt to find the culprit.

Edit: a word

Update: Holy shit this blew up. I'd just like to take a moment to defend myself a little. 1) We have a office rule of unless you label your food, its communal. I didnt think an unlabeled bottle of milk would be breast milk, this leads me to my second point... 2) I have another colleague who occasionally brings milk from home in a water bottle, so I didnt really think much of it. And 3) I've seen breast milk bottles before, this one was a little taller and didnt have any super apparent volume markings on the side so i didnt second guess anything (I'm 26M, not like I see a lot of breast feeding women/bottles anyway).

After reading how hard it can be to produce breast milk, I feel like absolute shit. ",tifu

AITA For Never Telling My Son About The Existance Of His Twin Brother,"My 4 year old son Jon is the one of the twins I had. My other son was mishandled by a nurse and passed away shortly after birth, it was an unfortunate accident. 


Me and my husband left our unnamed son with the hospital and did not press charges against the nurse, much to our parents'(both his and mine) displeasure. Our reason was that we had no time nor energy to deal with them, our priority was to look after Jon, who was much smaller than his twin and needed more attention.


While growing up, despite never being mentioned, Jon seemed to know that he once had a brother. He told us his made-up stories that he had about brothers, he played roles about brothers with his toys, and he even asked us to give him an older brother.


Initially, me and my husband made a promise that we would never tell Jon about his unnamed brother, but now he wants to tell Jon about it when he is older. It must have been the guilt that we have never acknowledged our unnamed son's existence, even though they are both our sons. 


I am still still standing firm to our promise. I believe that we should not dwell on the past and move on. Jon is my son and my little bundle of joy, I would never want him to know the sorrow of losing his brother. I want to convince him that his brother is just a fragment of his imagination.


Now both my parents, my husband's parents and my husband is calling me cold blooded. They want so much to included a deceased brother into Jon's life. He is still little, so it wouldn't be now, but they intended to tell him one day and I cannot stop them. However, I will still try to convince them while there is  time, he needs no such negativity from the past.


AITA for thinking this way?


Edit: Firstly I am sorry, but for anonymity purposes I omitted and changed some parts of the contents, so not all of it is real. Secondly thank you for the comments, took me a while to read it all. 

I am at peace now, and I will make it up to Jon.",AmItheAsshole

TIFU By being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. NSFW,"Well, this didn't happen today. But it's a funny story that I couldn't share with reddit at the time.

Rewind back to me at 14 years old. Awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

As such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

One night, to avoid watching TV with my Dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, I claimed that I had ""homework"" to do. Of course, this was a lie. I just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

So I fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

Now this is where things went wrong. I got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

You see, my bedroom was upstairs and I had no door. A sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my Dad, his Wife, and her two kids were watching TV. 

The desktop was right next to the staircase, but I figured that the TV was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. I was right.

But what I didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

I also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

I eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

And that's when I turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that I was casting a giant Shadow Puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. A perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. And I had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

So I did what anyone would do in that situation. I put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until I heard the TV come back on. Then I went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

No one ever brought it up. And I'm thankful. But I know what they saw. And I'm still cringing.

Tl;dr: Got horny. Got stupid. Projected a Masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. Still embarrassed.

Edit: Well shit. Glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.

TIFU by sending a picture of the engagement ring to my girlfriend,"tl;dr: Accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.

&nbsp;

  So this was actually a few months ago. I (24M) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24F). I was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. 

&nbsp;

  So I put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. Welp, it was immediately after clicking send that I noticed the texts in the thread didn't look right. I looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: It was my gf. ""Shit"" I said over the phone. My friend asked what was wrong, and I told him I'd have to call him back. Tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.

&nbsp;

  As a last ditch effort, I called her, as the message did not yet say ""Delivered"". She answered the phone and I immediately said ""Do you see the message I just sent?"" ""Yeah...it says attachment, why?"" Immediately I blurted ""Dont open it! Just delete the thread. Please."" 

&nbsp;

  She sounded concerned, and asked ""Is this something I should be worried about? You're kinda scaring me lol"". ""No, no,"" I said, ""I just have a little surprise for you I was trying to show someone and don't want to ruin the surprise."" She relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. ""Ok, I deleted it. Didn't look at it."" I know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but I can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. The 1 or 2 times I ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. It's just not in her to lie, and she's honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).

&nbsp;

  So I had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now I had her HIGHLY suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. So I immediately went and found a cute little necklace on Etsy I knew she'd like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. Later that week she got it and texted me, saying I was very sweet and she loved my surprise. Phew. A few weeks later I actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected I was going to propose. Despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her ""girls' day"" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.

&nbsp;

  When I told her about what that text really was and how I covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. She was impressed with how I improvised and threw her off track lol. We're getting married next October :)

TIFU by taking LSD and pretending to be French for 10 months,"Throwaway for reasons.
TL;DR at the bottom.

So this was more of a FU that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

About 11 months ago I moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until I could get the money together to sort something out properly, I was hoping to have already moved out by this point. On my second day after I'd finished unpacking I decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, I'd brought some with me that I'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

Things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and I quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than I had been told they were, and I thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. So I figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because I was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

So I left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. It's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. I'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. She said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

So basically I do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where I pretend I can't speak English. I remember a few words from my GCSE French so I just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. In the state I was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and French just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. My exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and I shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. She pretty much just left me to it after that and I got on my way. I did my walk and got home about two hours later, I was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. When I got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. I tried to keep my head down because I couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so I instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. When I got in I started freaking out straight away because I realised that I'd just become French and now two of the neighbours think I can't speak any English. The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be French for seemingly no reason. 

Fast forward 10 months, I still live here, and at this point I'm in DEEP. My life on this street is a web of lies. I've perfected my French accent and over the course of 10 months French Me has learnt a decent amount of English so he can hold disjointed conversation.
I'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and I was the nice quirky French guy on the street. I didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation I had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered I wasn't French. If I had friends come over (I don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. Most of them found it amusing, at least. 

Things were going okay and I wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because I'd gotten so used to it. I'm not home that much and when I am I rarely leave the house for any reason so I only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when I was out on my street. If anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when I got to take on my French persona. French Me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his English was a bit limited.

But then there was the day it all came crashing down. I was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her I didn't recognise. She stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy I was telling you about"". You might be able to see where this is going. 

Her friend hits me with a question in French that I didn't understand a word of, and I knew he was actually French straight away because his accent was way better than mine. I didn't know what to do and I just froze. Every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause I just decided I had to come clean. I told her I wasn't actually French and couldn't speak French and then I tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke I'd been doing on everyone. Nobody was buying that. I fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

I haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which I'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. I make sure nobody is around now whenever I leave the house, and I do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when I get home so that I never come into contact with them. Every time I think about the day I was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

TL;DR: Pretended to be French to avoid human interaction on LSD, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a French man.

EDIT: I didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and I'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. Some people seem to have a hard time believing that I thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, I'd like to remind people that when I made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",tifu
AITA for not replacing my sisters $3000 gaming laptop after my child spilled juice on it because it was on the floor?,"Title is pretty self explanatory. But basically over the weekend, I had a work trip to go on so my sister offered to babysit my 2 year old. She's babysat him a few times so knows what to expect. Well, this time, she left her $3000 gaming laptop *on the floor* of her lounge room. She gave my son an open cup of apple juice without supervision, and he decided to use the laptop as a table on the floor. Things happen and somehow it got knocked over.

Her laptop no longer switches on. She's blaming me and expects me to buy her a new one. I told her no as it shouldn't have been in his reach and certainly not on the floor. She's refusing to speak to me at the moment and said she'll never babysit for me ever again. I really don't feel as though it's my responsibility.. AITA?

EDIT: Yikes this blew up. A few people have asked for more info. Yes, I packed both a straw cup and sippy cup in my sons bag. I supplied everything he'd need for the weekend - including nappies and food. My parents were originally going to have him but my sister specifically asked if she could so she'd be able to spend time with him. It wasn't just 'babysitting' but more enjoying time with her nephew. I gave her some money if she wanted to get takeout or for extra supplies and she was happy with that as 'payment' for watching my son. Every other time she'd had him, the laptop has always been far out of reach.",AmItheAsshole

She showed up at my house almost immediately after I got off work.  I had the door open anyway, and she tried to just walk in, and I stopped her. 
She said, ""Oh, you can barge in on me but I can't barge in on you?""  I was stunned she had the audacity.  She continued with, ""Ya, you come to my friends (her ex...that answered covered in nothing but sweat and a pair of underwear.) house and night, banging on the door when his kids are trying to sleep. But you don't like it that i'm trying to barge in on you?""
I was stunned, I honestly didn't even know what you say.  I just told her I forgave her then asked her to leave, and she refused, and said, I'm not here for forgiveness.  She tried to push through me again but I didn't budge.  She begged me for 10 minutes of my time.  She said I don't have all the information and there's things she needs to tell me.  I told her I have all the information I need, there's nothing more to discuss, and she continued with trying to convince me that there was something important for me to know.  I told her she gaslighted me and manipulated me for the entire relationship, she denied and continued saying there's things I need to know.
Again, I asked her to just please leave that I had somewhere to be.  Then she just deadlooked me in the eye and said, ""somewhere to be huh? So you already had someone else anyway?""  I said, ""no, actually I've never even considered cheating on you.""  she responded with, ""Ya right, that's bullshit.""
Then went straight back into asking me, ""why wont you talk to me?  Why are you doing this to me?""
I responded, ""you mean standing up for myself?  I don't love you anymore.""
She said, ""Yes you do, you can't just turn it off it's not a switch.""
I told her that the person I loved never existed, and asked her again to please leave.

She said, ""you know what, you're not a fucking victim here not everyone is trying to fuck you over.""
I said, ""You're right, there are good women out there and I'll find one that deserves me one day.""
She responded, ""Not if you keep doing stupid shit like this you wont.""  Then walked off and finally left.

My head is swimming, did I handle this correctly, should I have given her a chance to talk to me?  I just feel like it's pointless, we can't be together, I'd never trust her.  On one hand, I feel like I could've handled it a little better.  I know I told her I didn't love her anymore, and I'm still so heartbroken,  I loved her really deep, and I still do to be honest.  I honestly don't know where to go from here.  I'm starting to feel a little bad for not letting her talk, but I just don't see the point.


Edit: Wow, I love the reddit community.  I got out of bed feeling down and then checked my phone,  the love and support that you've shown immediately put a smile on my face and made me feel like I matter again. You guys have turned around what I felt was going to be a hard day.  I can't explain how appreciative I am of every single one of your kind words of support, it means more to me than you know.  I'm going move forward from this, but now it's going to be easier for me knowing that I have the support of all of you beautiful people!  Thank you so much! I will definitely reply as much as I can throughout the day, as i'm going to go out and treat myself to something fun!

Dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. How do I protect myself legally?,"I have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. A few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

The last few months have been hell. They have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. They are loud way past our community quiet hours. They have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). I have recorded it. It wakes up my 2 year old. Do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

They leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. It has ruined my outdoor rug. I took pictures. 

They drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

They regularly park in the reserved spot I pay for monthly. It is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. They are an extra $50 a month. The minute I leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until I threaten to involve the apt. Manager.

They have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

They like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. I have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. It ruined my potted plants outside. 

I have reported all the incidents. I have tried to ask them to cut it out. They don't care. 

I recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out I am not the first to complain that day. The police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (I am not sure of how it was found. I stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

Since then they have taken to recording me any time I leave my apartment. They have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

The woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how I am impeding her ability to exist in public because I am racist. She says I call the police on her for doing nothing. I only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

I understand I am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. I would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

I just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot I pay for monthly, and play loud music I can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

She had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

They have really upped the bleach game too. It has gotten on a few spots on my door and I am scared they might throw it at my car. 

I have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. I can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

I can't lose my job and I am not sure how protect myself legally. 

They are actually my paid space right now but I am scared to have them towed because I don't know what they are going to do. I pay for that space. I have proof. The sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

If I tell the apartment they will have the car towed but I'll look like a racist. 

All it takes is one video and a lie and I am ruined. 

I want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but I think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that I pay for is reasonable. But maybe not?",legaladvice
"AITA for being upset about a ""prank"" my girlfriend pulled on me?","This past Friday, my girlfriend and I had a small get together at our apartment where I proceeded to get very drunk. I'm not a very experienced drinker. My girlfriend put me to bed early in the night. The next morning, I wake up very hungover and thirsty. I see that there is a water bottle on my night stand with a sticky note that says ""water"" on it. I thought this was weird at the time, because what else would it be? Very thankful that I didn't have to get up to get water, I proceed to chug the ""water"" only to quickly realize that it was actually vodka and then vomit all over our bed. At that point, my girlfriend woke up and was very angry at me. 

I felt very bad, I didn't realize at the time that my girlfriend had left the bottle there, so I got up and cleaned everything up even though I felt like dog shit. She denied putting the ""water"" there so I just thought one of our friends did it. It was a shitty thing to do, but I got over it until later that day one of the people there that night tagged me in an Instagram video of my girlfriend basically setting up the prank. It shows her pouring vodka into a water bottle and saying how funny it's going to be while her friend filming it is telling her she's being a dick and she just laughs and says ""hair of the dog"" then howls.

I confronted my girlfriend about this and she thinks the video is hilarious and sees no problem with it. I told her if she really didn't remember doing this, then she has a drinking problem. It was a very cruel thing to do. She said I was overreacting and being sensitive.

"[UPDATE] My [29M] fiancee [28F] of 4 years randomly claimed I abused her, and called the police. This came completely out of the blue.","Edit: Previous post [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)

Okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. I'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

A friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. She had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. I don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do I even really know the full story yet. She is not really the prank playing type and I guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

It looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. After I started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. Well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. I guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

Anyway, I texted her and I told her that I knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. She started blowing my phone up apologizing. She said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. She also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that I was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

I just didn't really respond to her. I left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. My family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. Our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. I'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

I don't really know where to go from here. I don't know if I should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

I'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. I'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as I'm awake with this Jameson. 

tl;dr: This was actually just a stupid prank by my fiancee.",relationship_advice
"Whether 18 or 40, women who have sexual relationships with 13 year olds need to be immediately hunted down by the law and put in 20 years prison, just like when its men doing the same thing.","https://preview.redd.it/zapcm4pe97c21.jpg?width=426&auto=webp&s=5da2b71aa1fd7350e23e933a19a84b7133b96a68

The double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. Why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/eM28YFrMdfI?t=9

here's a youtube video of SNL making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

There's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

Girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

Girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. Again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

Girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and EI is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

Therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. Because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is LEAGUES apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. Since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. It would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

Neither is acceptable. The double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is MALES who are underdeveloped for that age period. If there were a progressive victim stack, MALES should be ahead of FEMALES on the list because of the developmental delay.

Edit: JFC this blew up. 

#edit 2: Omg thanks for the gold guys, I really appreciate it! Omg I also got gilding! Thank you stranger. I am so blessed. I love you!

edit 3: Google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". I dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. Claiming I'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually WORSE because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

Being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

Go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

For anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

>I live in aus and about 11 years ago I used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with America, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the US for one summer. She went over there an had an inappropriate 'romance' with a camp attendee. He was 15 and she was 20. The boys parents found out and had her charged. She went to a women's prison in Iowa. Her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the US to try and get her sent back home. She is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. She is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. She is banned from ever travelling to the US. IMO she got what she deserved.

TIFU by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend,"I have grapheme-color synesthesia. Basically I see letters and numbers in colors. The letter 'E' being green for example. A couple months ago I was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. He asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. Since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what I said a few months ago. Always being the sameish as course. He still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe I just memeroized them really really well.

Tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. I tried explaining to him I just see the colors automatically when I visualize the letters in my head. I asked him what colour are the letters in his head. He looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

My boyfriend didnt understand what I meant by visualizing the letters. He didn't believe me that I can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

Turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. When he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. He can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. He thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... Its crazy to him the fact that I can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

Now I have a boyfriend that is really upset. He feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. He's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing I wasnt pulling his chain. Hes pretty upset and I feel really bad. 

Tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (Cant visualize anything at all)

Edit; Oh wow this blew up. I just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. He never thought I was lying. I think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",tifu

AITA for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?,"My sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. Her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  I was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. Out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. She got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. She said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so I can see how long it takes her if I want to know so badly. So, I did. I got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. Sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. Then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later I was done. I guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what I did in half an hour.  She once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine I lied about how long it takes because I HATE cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

TIFU by almost murdering my friend and stopping a school-wide arms race.,"So this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. Now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. And just before Sillybands took over as chief Tween Pimp Currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed ""locker artillery"". Basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. We would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and Paper Hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.

Eventually, things got out of hand. It became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. Heists were performed on teacher's desks. Books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. Students presented welts from Paper Hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. Rubber bands were contraband. It was a full-on Mad Max Magic School Bus adventure.

Here's where the fuckup started. One night, I was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: The secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. Spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. I needed something aerodynamic. So, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. ""I'll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?"" I thought to myself.

Let me tell you.

The next day, I created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. With the inkwell loaded, I felt like a small, sexually frustrated MacGyver with intent to kill. On the bus, my friend (let's call him Neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. I obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. Neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). I aimed, pulled back and fired. All I saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before I heard an extremely sudden *crack*. I looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from Neo's head.

My parents had to pay for the window. Neo's parents didn't let me over to his house until Senior Year. The principal cracked down on Locker Artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. 

But I still won that arms race.

TL;DR: Sixth Grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. I upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. I was suspended and my friend's parents don't like me anymore.

"A bartender tipped himself $5,000 on my debit card and my local police told me i'm not allow to press charges as long as they're willing to give it back.","Basically a bartender gave himself a nice tip on my debit card after only spending about $30 on a few drinks. My account didn't have that much money, but since it was put through as a tip the original charge of $30 which went through changed to $5,041.75, which put my account at negative a couple thousand.


I went down to the police station, which is located right down the road, and explained my story to the cop so he can file a report. He said he's known the owner for years and was gonna go down there and sort it out. I get a call a couple hours later that he's willing to refund the $5000, but I said I still wanted to press charges. The officer said I literally can't ""as long as the other party is willing to make good.""

So i'm wondering here that how the fuck can someone try to rob you of 5k but its totally cool that once he's caught that he's sorry and will give it back?

I was refunded the 5k to my account, but now I have a shit load of overdraft fees because I use PayPal to pay for my recurring payments (phone, spotify, HBO, etc.) Every time PayPal attempts to charge me, my bank tacks on another $35 overdraft fee. I've already been to the bank and opened the fraud dispute, but I only received a letter saying it'll take 60 days. I do not drive and i'm dependent on uber/lyft to get to work and I can't use that with a negative balance and my phone is about to be shut off because of this. Every time I check my account, it's just further in the negative and I don't know what to do.

TIFU by buying a used PlayStation 2 on Letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.,"This happened only minutes ago.


The graphics card in my old PS2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so I decided to replace it when I had a little extra cash. I was out browsing different sites like Craigslist and the like, when I stumbled upon the PS2 mentioned in the title. It looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


At the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


Now, I should preface this by saying that I have a strange faith in the honesty of others. Benefit of the doubt and all that noise. After all, the car I drive now is one I bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. Why should this be any different?


Starting to sound like a mistake yet?


If the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. That is almost certainly about to change. The model the seller advertised on Letgo was one of the larger black brick models. Like, the first generation ones. When I finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. When he showed me the goods, It was actually one of the slim and silver PS2's from later in the console's production run. He told me he had already sold the larger one.


My first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that I should have walked away when I saw I was being sold something that was improperly advertised. Unfortunately for me (and I guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), I was not in the most logical mood. It was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. I just wanted to get this thing and go home.


Back at the ole ranch, I hooked up the console, slapped in Kingdom Hearts II, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. I'm off work and done with class, what else would I do with my evening, right? I was pretty happy with my life until I realized I had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. Strange, but not altogether discouraging. I slapped in another game that I new for sure was working. Didn't read. I repeated this several times with discs I knew would work; same story.


Now I'm starting to get slightly pissed. I'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


I open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. Not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. I've now got no way to contact him. Of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. All I could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. That, or I could get onto YouTube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. I picked the latter option and went on my merry way. After a video about a quick mod I could make to the system, I was feeling pretty confident that I was going to get the last laugh on this one.


Oh golly gee fuck was I wrong.


Now at this point, I begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. I manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. It's putting up a little more of a fight than I saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? It was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. With a little elbow grease, it starts to give. I'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. A bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so I can live with that. The further I get it open, the more rust I see on some more critical pieces. I'm sweating again, but holding out hope. Finally, the plastic casing comes free, and I experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


I experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


You see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. The first thing I notice is that the inside is covered in rust. The second thing I notice is that some of the rust is moving.


Oh, that's not all rust.


*Ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


Do you know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is like, ""Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?"" That was me. Except with Cockroaches. They are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. And now they're crawling on my hands. And these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. I threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


They're getting everywhere now. I'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. You would think that something caught fire with the way I was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. Tiny, $25 freaks of nature. Eventually I managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point I grabbed a can of Raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


At least, I *hope* I finished the job. I'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point I'm a little too emotionally drained to care.

"[Update] My dog got into a fight with a smaller dog. Owner asks for $1000 but won't show me vet bills. San Francisco, CA"," **Previous Post;**

[https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0nqur/update\_my\_dog\_got\_into\_a\_fight\_with\_a\_smaller\_dog/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a0nqur/update_my_dog_got_into_a_fight_with_a_smaller_dog/) 

&#x200B;

This happened couple of months ago and I forgot to update you guys. I guess, I just wanted to forget what happened.

Here is the rundown of what I did and what the outcome was.

&#x200B;

I started talking to my neighbors who know my dog and I asked all of them to write what they though about my dog, while being aware of the incident and thankfully every one wrote very nice things about my dog and us as owners.

We went to the hearing and there were many people there for their own dog related incidents. 

After signing up a police officer asked me and my girlfriend to have a word. I will not say who he was but he was basically aware of the situation and he thought that we should not be there. He assured us that we should be fine even before the hearing started.

There were couple incidents we heard prior to ours and they all were related to dogs biting humans. We were the only ones there over a dog fighting another dog.

They called the person who sued me on stand and that's when the show started. He did really put a show for everyone.

He mentioned that his dog was dead for minutes but he resuscitate his dog. He mentioned that there were blood everywhere. He started crying and sobbing. He actually said that he tried to pull his dog from my dog's mouth but he though his dogs skin was coming off. I know it sounds all bad but don't worry because none of this happened and his dog was fine. My dog did really bite him but it was a bark bite where he penetrated skin only and let go. He had pictures with him and he thought those pictures would help his argument but it really did not. It looked like the dog just got scratched.

Once he was done, it was our turn to speak. We kept it cool and explained what happened. We told the judge what we were doing to make sure this would never happen again. I also mentioned how he was asking for money and refusing to show me any bills. And that was it.. I called 3 weeks later and I was notified that our dog was not deemed danger to anyone.

&#x200B;

I know it's been a while and people who gave me opinions here most likely won't see it but I wanted to thank everyone.

&#x200B;

TL;DR My dog bit another dog over ball. It wasn't serious injury at all. Owner demanded 1k$ + more in time. I agreed but wanted to see bills and owner freaked out and sued us and tried to get my dog put down. He failed and my lovely boy is next to me now.",legaladvice

WIBTA If I broke up with my girlfriend over my cat's mental health?,"Throwaway because she knows my reddit account. Hear me out on this one. Please? 

&#x200B;

I've been with my girlfriend (we'll call her Molly) for about 4 years, lived together for 3. Earlier last year our 17 year old cat lost her battle with cancer. I've had cats my whole life and adopted her as a senior before meeting Molly. Molly never had cats before but adored her, and started talking about adopting immediately. About six months later in December she found a youngish (7mos?) feral male who got a nasty-but-recoverable injury sleeping under a car hood. She fell in love immediately and so did I. I tried to give her the benefit of my experience and told her that this isn't going to be the same as adopting an adult cat who already has a sweet personality, and this kitten will require a lot of patience. She said she understood and we started foster-to-adopting him as soon as the vet gave us the go-ahead. 

&#x200B;

I still love him, but he's highlighted every single thing that's been keeping us from getting engaged. For one, Molly refuses to listen to him. He growls, he hisses at her. She started yanking him out of his carrier so often that he's afraid to go in there now. She doesn't listen to ME when I try to explain what she could do to get him to warm up to her. She keeps bringing up examples of people she knows who got a cat to like them this way. I work at home, and he's a completely different cat when I'm home and she isn't.  He plays and sits in the window when it's just me and runs under the bed the second she gets home and only comes out to eat. 

&#x200B;

I've suggested to her that we need to start seriously thinking about finding him another home before he gets too old and too scared. Every single time I bring it up she accuses me of being callous and giving up on him too easily, and how she never knew pets were so disposable to me. They're not, but she's not a good fit for him. So at this point I'm beginning to think that his best shot is me breaking up with her and taking this poor cat with me.  Our relationship isn't that solid but I think it might be fixable if it wasn't for this, but he's a living being and deserves to be happy too. 

&#x200B;

tl;dr: My girlfriend and I adopted a cat and she makes him miserable. She thinks it'd be cruel to rehome him, so I'm seriously considering breaking up with her and taking him with me. WIBTA?",AmItheAsshole
"If you think that certain fashion ads should be banned because the models are unhealthily skinny, then you should also apply that logic to obese models.","A bunch of ads for something called nasty girl were pulled in Europe because the models were deemed too skinny. So fucking what? If people are so weak minded that they can't make their own health decisions, I think we should just let Darwinism run its course.

&#x200B;

How many people are dying from being too thin versus too fat? How much more dangerous for the average person is diabetes, poor cardiovascular health, higher blood pressure, higher risk of stroke, knee injuries, etc. than taking in too few calories? It's inconceivable to me that on average, the effects  of glamorizing thin women would be worse than the opposite - people are FATTER THAN EVER, and most people could use a push towards less body fat, whereas helping people disregard the negative health impact of being obese is damaging for society.

&#x200B;

People should be able to employ whatever models they want, and consumers should be able to read the ads they want, but lets not act like models being thin is worse for young women than models that are morbidly obese. Sure, it's bad for the models themselves, but if you aren't comfortable with the line of work, do something else.

Haha good joke Mandy. 

Anyway, Mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. Most leave and we're still hanging out. I'm like hey, what if we get in your hot tub?

TIFU when I ADJUSTED my bra in front of a cute guy.,"I am cringing while writing this. I was going to a library to study (I'm in college, yay ) and I saw this cute guy as I'm walking in. I was thinking ""hot damn, he fine"" but I didn't think he saw me so I sat down at a table that was empty. It's early morning on a Friday, so no one was there. I was in a rush to leave dorms, so my bra was not fitting right at all-TMI but basically only 40% of my left boob was actually in the bra.

Since the library room I was in was basically empty I had the bright idea to, with both hands, grab my bra (through my shirt, don't worry)and hitch it up. I can't exaggerate this enough-this was not a sly fixing of the strap, or a gentle adjusting of a side boob: I was fondling myself. 

Literally as I am grabbing my breasts, the cute boy, who was still deciding where to sit, chose to walk back in my direction and saw the whole thing, which I only realized when I looked up.

Then he chose to sit next to me? I don't know why? Do boys find girls who viciously yank at their bras in libraries on Friday mornings attractive? But I was so embarrassed at this point, and my face was hot, so I didn't even look at him. He kept sneaking glances at me, and I have NO IDEA what he was thinking. That I was psycho? That he had to sit in that seat because it was too late to turn back? I don't know. 

Anyway, to add to this, my stomach kept rumbling in the quiet library. It's at that point that I decided I had to get out of there, and of course I tripped as I tried to stand. Anyway. That's me. This is my life. Thoughts? Comments? Help? 

TLDR: a cute boy in a library saw me trying to stuff my boobs back into my bra.

"Reddit is too hard to actively participate in due to ridiculous sub rules, post formating, tyrannical mods, and rude users. No wonder a majority of the user base doesn't participate.","I don't quite know where to start, but so many subs make it frustrating to actively participate in them. If you want to post content, you have to first check sub rules, then make sure the post title is formatted, and then hope that the mods don't use the extremely vague rules to remove your post. Even if your posts stays up, you have to then make sure people aren't rude assholes about what opinions or content you dare share.

It's like a pack of ravenous wolves waiting to rip whatever words you have to shreds.
Do you have a cool idea for something, and want to share? Well that's too bad, because a dozen users are waiting to tell you how you're wrong, and your ideas are terrible.

So you have to find good content, and meticulously make sure it fits sub rules, nazi mod's personal tastes, and make sure it can't get picked apart by smartass Redditors looking to ""well actually"" you with some swift ""facts"" they pulled from a 10 year old unreputable article. 

It's exhausting. On top of which, Reddit sometimes blocks posting for a number of minutes in certain subs, so if you fuck up a title by accident, you have to wait 5-10 minutes to actually fix your mistakes, and by then, I'm usually just frustrated beyond interest anymore. 

It's just not a fun environment to participate in. No wonder people respond with generic jokes and low efforts comments, because that's the easiest way to just slide into participating without worrying about much. 

Posting opinions is exhausting, no matter how innocent you think they are, or even if you are just having fun with hypotheticals. An opinion post always has to be self aware enough to deconstruct every smartass counter argument before you even hit the submit button, and it's exhausting. 

Want to ask/ express why the new Corvette should be offered in purple? Well you'll have 20 people tell you it's stupid, it's not financially feasible, and it'll never sell. 

Defending yourself on anything just gets you in trouble, and mods with NEVER take your side with anything. A mod will never side with you over another mod. You can't barter with these people. You can't logically defend anything against their decisions. 

No matter how innocent the sub seems, the mods always seem to be on a power trip. 

It's honestly just not ""fun"". The ""Reddit is Fun"" app should be named ""Reddit isn't Fun"". 

I honestly don't understand what it is about human nature, where eveyone has to be a negative dickhead. I don't get why everything has to be overly structured to the point of sucking the very enjoyment from the activity. 

And those are both rhetorical questions. Something most Redditors can't grasp for some reason. 

You can stalk my history. I get frustrated with things, but I try not to pick fights for the sake of doing it. I don't troll. Arguing is just a waste of energy on here. I just like to express my interest in certain things, and hope other like minded people chime in. The issue is no like minded people ever chime in for much. It's always people telling you how wrong you are, but never someone backing you up. It's just exhausting. 

For the love of god active Reddit users, reply to people's opinions you stand by with something positive, and stop being so damn negative all the time. Life can be negative enough. Don't let it spill into everything you do. 

Fight for less strict rules if you get frustrated, and go through the proper reporting channels to put tyrannical mods in their place. This place just gets worse the more nobody does anything about it.

One of the most satisfying things is upvoting a downvote.,"I'm not sure why, but it gives me so much pleasure to upvote a comment that has 0 back to 1. Sometimes I don't even read the comment before I do it.

When the post is alive and someone downvotes, I get enjoyment from thinking how angry they get when I upvote. They were emotional enough to downvote the comment, so I know how emotional they get seeing it jump back up and ultimately cancel out their vote.

I imagine someone arguing in the comment section and refreshing the page to see the person they hate on a small post has gone back to one and there is nothing they can do, their vote has already been cast.

Sometimes when 2 people are arguing, and both have 0s (from downvoting each other), I will choose one to upvote just to make another mad and feel like they are losing the argument. I don't usually choose based on who is right, but who is more emotionally invested in the conversation.

AITA for asking a neighbor if she wanted to share food?,"I'm a 31 year old single guy who lives alone in an apartment complex. I've lived there for 6 years. My neighbor across the hall, a woman around my age or a little younger (I actually don't know her first name but I'll call her Katie) lives across the hall from me diagonally and has for about 2 years. We exchange hellos but aren't friendly, which is how it is with most of my neighbors.

So I don't know how to cook, and due to losing one of my part time gigs, I don't have as much money for takeout anymore. I'm getting really sick of eating cheap fast food or box mac and cheese. I'm gaining weight and I never feel great.

This is where Katie comes in. I can always smell her cooking in the hall and it always smells amazing (I know it isn't the other person at our end of our hall cause it's a single old man). I've even complimented it a few times. So I got the idea that I'd offer to give her some money each week to cook a little extra and bring it over to me (or I can pick it up from her!) at night. She's cooking anyway and then I'd have varied presumably delicious food.

I asked her the next time I saw her and she looked surprised and said she couldn't because she was too busy (which didn't make sense cause she cooks almost every day but okay). The next time I saw her a few days later, I asked her if she was sure and upped the amount I was offering, and she said she was sure and that it was rude to ask me, and that she isn't a housekeeper for hire and I should get a housekeeper if that's what I want. She also called me 'a stranger' even though we have talked in the halls before.

Overall she made me feel like a big jerk and really embarrassed for even asking her, and a little mad because she was acting like I was being creepy (I wasn't, trust me, she isn't my type). I think asking her to split cooking wasn't completely outlandish, since she cooks every day anyway and it wouldn't be hard to make a little more.

So, AITA?

EDIT: People keep assuming I'm sexist because I didn't think it was the old man who lives on our hall cooking. It's not an assumption for me. He and I have lived across from each other for 6 years. The cooking smells didn't start til she moved in, and I've talked to her about how good her cooking smells before.

EDIT: Okay. It is abundantly clear that I was the asshole and asking her was inappropriate and, as much as I hate to admit it, creepy. My instinct is to apologize to her but since my instinct was to ask her in the first place, I'll do the opposite and stay out of her hair. Thanks.",AmItheAsshole

I clean for private residences in my local area. A year ago, a favorite client of mine's grandson ""Mark"", a 22 year old that lived with my client, accused me of stealing money from their home. $150 to be exact. I was eventually charged with theft, and facing up to 2 years in jail and huge fines!! I have a clean record, and it was his word against mine. So I fought it, and would not accept a plea bargain. For the last year, I've had to report to the court house monthly And sit in the courtroom next to dozens of others and reiterate that I would NOT accept a plea bargain. My public defender would really lay it on thick too. He would say things like, Sure it's awful to plead guilty to something you didnt do, but you know whats worse? Being in jail for something you didnt do. He would pressure me with the what-ifs of standing trial and the verdict is basically a coin flip. I was never so afraid in my life! But in life, you are given opportunities to either fight or surrender.. and even though the sacrifice here was my freedom, the alternative was my dignity. So we finally have a trial date set and about 2 days before I went in to pick my jury, my public defender calls me with news-The Prosecution is dropping the charges and making a motion to NULLIFY!! What?! I damn near fell backwards!! Gone. All that stress, all that needless anxiety..GONE!

(FINAL UPDATE) My new employer has a creative way of doing payroll that just doesnt seem...legal. Are you ready for a Justice Boner?,"Edit: a word and a state. SC. 

I was waiting to update this pending Big Doings by the corporate office, so thank you. 

So I quit, though I bet you all saw that coming. 

I gave 4 weeks notice per the crazy ass owners ""requirement"" because I decided to move out of state and had the time. 

Then he decided to try and screw me. When the schedule for my last 2 weeks came out, I wasn't on it. He apparently told the manager not to schedule me because I was ""toxic"" and ""not a team player"". 

But, as the saying goes, I didn't get mad. I got even. 

I knew he would try to call me in. Because that's what happens when you only have two people to close and one isn't working. So every time he called I said ""I wasn't scheduled today, so I made plans.""

After about a week he threatened to fire me. My response? ""You already did. Constructive dismissal exists. You reduced my hours to zero, basically firing me. I've already been to the unemployment office."" (I didn't, I was moving, but I wanted to hear his heart audibly stop.)

Then I asked about my last check. Since he's fired me, I needed to pick it up. He said I could get it on payday and hung up. 

I should also note that during this time I sent very lengthy email to the corporate office detailing every single shady and illegal thing this ass was doing. From trying to write work arounds for labor laws into the hand book, to getting employees to pay him back ""overpayments"" with personal checks, to the contamination, all of it. With pictures. 

So payday rolls around. No check. I call and no one answers. I go in person and no one knows anything because apparently, no one got paid. No one. Not even the managers. There's no direct deposit, he always cut paper checks (and forward dated them 3 days) so everyone was screwed. 

But me? I was walking on sunshine. Straight to small claims the next day with a written letter from the assistant manager (who's a friend, tbh) verifying that I had quit and not been paid and calls to the owner about it hadn't been returned. He had two days or until the next pay period, as long as it didn't exceed 30 days, to pay me after separation. 

He showed up and tried to say the Internet was down, which is why I wasn't paid on time, but the judge was having none of it. I got the max I could claim, 3x what he originally owed me. And the joy of seeing him get dressed WAY TF DOWN. 

And it gets better. Due to my emails and photos (along with other employees who made reports) Corporate descended on that franchise like a swarm of angry Valkyries. 

I was long gone and moved away by the time they actually did anything but he got ousted. 

Officially, he turned it over to spend time with his family (cause his daughter joined a Christian cult and ran away???)  but really corporate was FURIOUS at the shit he was doing and the terrible reputation the place had (essentially damaging the brand) so they threatened to rain legal brimstone down on him so hard it would make god jealous unless he turned the store over. 

According to the assistant manager anyways. 

Alls well that ends well. I got paid and Asshole Supreme got a banging dose of karma. ",legaladvice

I couldn't find the lawyer's name anywhere, but the law firm was real so I reached out to them. The letter was fake and the law firm was not happy. They asked for the letter and are pursuing some sort of legal action against my parents. I don't know exactly what's happening as I have not been in contact with my parents in a while.

In other news, my daughter was recently diagnosed with a (very minor) skin condition that is fairly uncommon and that I also have, which means she's most likely mine after all. We still won't be doing a paternity test any time soon, but it was helpful for our peace of mind.

"My (26M) Girlfriend (24F) of 3.5 years uninvited me from a trip to Last Vegas in January, only to be unfaithful and carry on an affair with a family friend (37M).","This has been a whirlwind of events. I am in shock writing about it and need an outlet to express whats happened.

My GF and I have had an amazing relationship and always wanted a future and family together. This all changed and I no longer know the person I once loved. Full disclosure: I have never suspected my girlfriend was capable of something like this. She has had the wool over everyones eyes.

In 2018, myself, my gf and her mother planned a weekend trip together to Las Vegas for her moms friends 60th birthday. Plane tickets were bought, accommodation arranged, and a whole weekend of events was planned from Jan 11 ‚Äì 14. What could go wrong.

Come Christmas time, said friend (60F) from Las Vegas flew up to our hometown (where she is from), with her extended family to celebrate Christmas in Canada. She has a son (37M). Over Christmas eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day, we hung out at this families Air BNB house in our hometown and I got to know them very well. I consider myself to be very observant, and I noticed zero interaction between the son (37M) and my girlfriend (24F). After Christmas, the family flew back to Las Vegas and awaited our arrival for the January weekend.

Here is where I should have clued in, which I partially did, just not to the extent that would have helped. About a week before Las Vegas, my girlfriend informed me that the boyfriends of couples who were supposed to fly down to Las Vegas had bailed out on the trip, and slowly the trip was turning into a 'Girls Trip.' My girlfriend never outright expressed to me she didn't want me going, but did her best to ensure me I wouldn't have fun there. 3 days before we leave, my girlfriend outright tells me I cannot come; Accommodations have been rearranged and I'm no longer invited on the trip. Given that I had paid for this trip, I was visibly upset. I expressed that I didn't feel as if this was a partnered decision but rather her trying to intentionally exclude me from something I was invited to. Ultimately, she left the decision up to me. I decided it didn't feel right at this point to go unless I was convinced she wanted me there, which I wasn't. Friday came and went, she flew with her mom, I stayed home.

My girlfriend ended up losing her passport down there. (The lie detector test determined that was a lie.) She stayed a few days extra and flew back. She met up with me the following Friday and told me she no longer is happy in our relationship and wants to break things off, hoping that we will get back together in the future. I protested, but understood from our current spat that something wasn't right and that we should go our separate ways. Maybe one day we would get back together.

This leads us all to today. For the last month, my ex girlfriend and I have been communicating on and off (phone and texting) but have never seen each other. She has been extremely busy preparing for her teaching practicum (so I thought). She and I would both initiate conversation, and discuss our relationship and talk about working things out in the future. She and I both told each other we had no interest in seeing other people. On valentines day, she even messaged me saying how we should be together and she misses me.

After struggling to move on with my life I decided today was the day I would head over to her parents house (where she lives) and express my feelings and ask if this could be worked out once and for all. By pure coincidence (because nobody else was home at the time) and the kindness of a step-father, the truth was revealed to me.

I called her house and asked her step-dad respectfully if he'd allow me to come to the door and speak with my ex. Him and I got along great and he said I'm always welcome to come and talk but unfortunately, she is not there and neither is her mother. She is in Banff during her 'busy practicum weekend'. Her step-father sat me down and began with this: ""I'm assuming you're here because you don't know everything. If you knew everything, I don't think you'd be here. I have been told by GF, GF mom, and other family members not to tell you anything, but I have a lot of respect for you. My ex-wife of 10 years cheated on me and I know how it feels. Anything you ask me, I will answer completely honestly.""

Confused, I sat down where everything had been explained to me. My girlfriend had begun an affair in Las Vegas with the son (37F) of her moms best friend. Every weekend since, he has been flying my ex-gf down to Las Vegas to meet him and this past weekend took her to Banff with the whole family. Keep in mind, he is divorced, and has 2 kids (8 and 10). I am absolutely disgusted and feel sick about what really happened. I don't even know how this happened.

I cannot thank this man enough for telling me the truth which nobody felt the need to pass onto me. I feel betrayed, deceived, heartbroken, and angry. Suffice to say, I am in an absolute state of shock.

I simply texted her saying ""I know everything, never contact me again,"" and my phone has been blowing up ever since. Her demanding to know who told me, her denying what has happened, her being angry with me.

I'm completely lost reddit. I thought I was going to marry this girl one day. How does someone change in the blink of an eye. I learned more about my girlfriend in 30 mins than I did over the course of 3.5 years.

Where do I go from here? Advice very much welcome.

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments everyone. I've read them all and they do show the upsides to this garbage situation. Since this shit storm began, my ex returned from her trip and figured out within a few hours who spilled the beans. Just to clarify: the step-dad assured me on my way out that he would be crucified for this and had accepted his fate. Her house got turned upside down like the circus it is and I've been being blamed for it all. I haven't responded to text/calls from my ex, her mother, or their house. After denying what had taken place, I just assume at this point it will be more lies. She has every reason to lie about it. Whereas, the step-dad had every reason not to lie. Thanks again everyone for the support and advice. The succubus has been phone blocked and on all social media.

It appears as though companies can do what they want to the ""little people"" as long as the right peoples pockets are being lined, nothing seems to have any regulation and no one who can do anything about it seems to care. 

What's worse is a lot of Americans seem blind to this, they've been raised to see it as normal. They talk about how they are free and America is great but from my point of view it they're spewing nothing different from the propaganda force fed to the people of communist countries.

A good friend and neighbor recently passed away and left me 5% of his surprisingly large will. Now his adult son is suing me (Virginia).,"So basically, I lived next door to my neighbor for around 5 years. He was a widower in his early 60s, and we quickly bonded. We watched football together, drank together, and all that. I even went to his church every now and then, even though it's not my bag. The point, I guess, is that even though he had 30 years on me, we were friends. I think this point is important.




He recently passed, which sucks. Then I learned he left me a little something. That little something turned out to be just over $40,000, which nearly knocked my dick off since I had no idea he had that kind of money. That 40k, though a lot of money, was ""only"" around 5% of his net worth. So it's not like I'm getting the majority of his estate. But then his son, who I'd met a couple times, sued me (as of yesterday), claiming that  I ""took advantage"" of his elderly father. 




I have three things going for me:




1. My friend was mentally acute. He had his share of health problems (pack-a-day smoker), but none of them were mental.




2. Our town's not big, and I know people who can attest to the fact that we went to the bar and church and watched football together, proving that we actually had a relationship. Hell, I even mowed his lawn, which our neighbors can attest to. These people can be witnesses I think, though I don't know how civil suits work.


3. His adult daughter is a very nice lady, and has no problems with her dad leaving me some of his estate. She came around from time to time, and knew her dad and I hung out and stuff. The first time I met her, her dad and I were watching college football in our robes while sitting on my porch and drinking beer (we live in the South so that's acceptable behavior for grown men). 





Basically, my point is he and I were friends, and does the son have a pot to piss in regarding this lawsuit? Also, what kind of lawyer should I hire? The lawyer who did his will seemed like a straight shooter, but I don't know if me hiring him is a conflict of interest or if he's even the right kind of lawyer to represent me.





Edit: You guys were right. The son's contesting the will, not suing me directly. The letter had a bunch of legal terms, so I didn't get the gist when I first read it. I'll be contacting a lawyer ASAP.",legaladvice

"My ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), I was starting to heal until I found out the reasons why he ghosted.","The past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. I'm not sure if I'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

My ex, 'Tom', and I had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so I thought. We had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). I was happy, and I thought he was too. We had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, I could go on. 

Everything was fine until our last trip together. We went to a destination where I had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something I'd have to wait longer to do. It was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. Once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

After we landed (the last time I saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. I didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. I tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. I started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. From there our communication basically broke down. I can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. From that point I'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. After about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then I wouldn't hear from him for several more days. What hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with New Years, Valentine's Day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

I felt like I was going crazy. I had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  I was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. I stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. I found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse I could think of whenever I showed up somewhere without him. 

I eventually broke down, I contacted one of his good friends who I felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. I told her that Tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and I have no idea what's going on. I told her I didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that I needed to know about. She looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that Tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and I that I was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. This was soul crushing to hear and I felt humiliated and worthless. I told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. She said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

Throughout March and April I felt like I was starting to heal some. I felt broken, but I started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. I told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. Then I found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

He had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. Not sure how long, but a little less than a year. I'm also hurt because I know the person he cheated on me with. She's an absolute garbage person. And I'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. She has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. I've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the LGBT community and non-Christians. She is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. She somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. I think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, I'm really not sure. I can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. I've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. Not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. Her parents have paid for her car and I think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. She spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and I frequent and will interject herself into our outings. She has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

Tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew I wouldn't approve. Then he started to get high and then have sex with her. He felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. His intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. This woman hated my guts, and kept pushing Tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. He didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

Tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. So she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. He came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

I only found out about this, because the same friend I had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that Tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that I deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. There is no way in hell that I'd get back together with Tom
2. I can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that Tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and I'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

I don't know what to do at this point. I'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. I don't know if I could contain my urge to slap him, or if I would just break down and sob. I was doing well from moving on from him. I was starting to feel happy again. Now, I think I'm back at square 1. I'm depressed and stressed out. 

Is there anything I can do? I kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",relationship_advice

TIFU by fingering a girl,"Obligatory this happened yesterday. This girl and I had a fun filled day out on the town. Afterwards we got a hotel. Things started getting hot and heavy and my fingers ended up in her pants. One thing led to another and I started fingering her. She was having a grand old time showing the usual signs that I was doing a decent job. A good portion of the way through my nails must have given her a bit of a cut and she said ou.... and passed out cold. I'm sitting her wondering what the fuck just happened. I call her name and start panicingly shaking her. She's not responsive and I slap her face. As soon as I did this she starts having a seizure. Now I'm freaking the out. I jump out of bed and start to call an ambulance. I'm about to start the call and when she stops and starts making grunting noises. She's giving me this wtf just happened look and I tell her what happened. At first she tells me she doesn't believe me but then said that she has a history of having seizures when she gets hurt or scared. She said that when she has a seizure it's best to let it take its course unless it goes on for a while. I just sat there in that ""thank god I didn't finger a girl to death"" state. Needless to say our sexy time ended right there.

"If Tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.","Tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. I can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. I have friends who have been fat fished. That's essentially the same damn thing. Why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. It's so fucking dumb to me. A girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""You go girl!"", ""Girl power!"", blah blah blah. A guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""Asshole!"", ""So misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. It annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are.

Let me be clear, **I have no issue with a woman if she is fat. I am just not attracted to it. Also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because I'm 5'9""** 

&#x200B;

Yes I'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to Bumble, and it's not as bad as something like Hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. While this is about Tinder's new settings, I think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

TIFU when using the shower head to masturbate,"Alrighty it's now the morning after;  I am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won't stop laughing at me. 

Last night hubby & I had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. 

As usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. One of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know üòâ

As a 35 year old woman I had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. Sure, I have toys (I'm no prude) but I had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. 

The night ended and we went home. Smelling of the bonfire I tell hubby I'm having a shower & he says he doesn't care, he's going to bed. 

I should admit I was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an Uber in case anyone's concerned we drove under the influence). 

I'm washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. Ok, imma try the shower head... 

Ok feels good but need more pressure.. 

Ok feels better but I could still use more pressure.. 

Ohh ok that's just right. Yeah that's the spot... oh YEAH THAT'S THE SPOT!!!!! 

...Screaming: Ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! 

Just as I was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. I slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as I managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. 

Hubby came running in and I'm telling you it was a fucking sight. 

I'm planked from the shower across the toilet (In like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while I'm crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. 

I fucked up y'all. 

It takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that's ever happened. 

I managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. Lucky.

Anyway we went to the ED because I did have a few decent cuts but I only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. Again, lucky. 

I told the nurse & doctor that I slipped while cleaning the shower. You know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. 

I'll be telling our landlord the same thing today. 

TL;DR went to town on myself with the shower head, as I orgasmed I slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ED for a few stitches.

Edit: changed the TLDR for u/Nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate

Edit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. Thanks for the awards too. 

To answer the biggest question: I was embarrassed and panicked when I said I was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying I slipped. Stupid I know, but none of us are perfect.

TIFU by telling a stranger I can't wait to fuck them tonight,"Disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. I only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, ""What was your most embarrassing moment?""

So I was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing I would get fully sloshed at the party. She was right.

On the way home, I ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. She pulls her light blue Jeep into the parking lot, I stumble out of the Jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

I (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue Jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. ""I can't wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.""

I was not expecting to get hit in the face. I also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming I've ever heard in my life. Instinctively, I covered up my face and wondered what the hell I said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

The screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so I couldn't really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when I heard, clear as a bell, ""You fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.""

WHOA WHOA WHOA instant sobriety. I uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although I was in a blue Jeep, it was not my gfs blue Jeep. My gfs identical blue Jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman's blue Jeep. 

I finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. She convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. 

I did not fuck anyone that night.

"LPT: When Arguing, Try Restating the Main Point's of the Other Person's Argument Back to Them and Have Them Do the Same with You","Believe it or not, the vast majority of Arguments are based on miscommunication.  

With arguments, there are often several things occurring simultaneously that result in conflict.

1) Not understand the other person's argument

2)  Feeling that the other person does not understand your argument

3) Convoluting and intertwining non-related issues into the argument

4)  Arguing about two different things all the while thinking you are both arguing about the same thing...

5) An unwavering belief that you are right and the other person is wrong and thus you don't need to listen to their argument

...

Next time you are arguing with someone pause the argument and restate their argument back to them.  

Something like, ""Hold on, I want to make sure I understand what you are arguing. You are saying that XYZ is broken and the only way to fix XYZ is to get QRS to modify Y so that it will fit better into Z?""

Now this has several benefits.  

--First and foremost it helps to identify exactly what the fuck the argument is even about.  This is huge because most arguments get so convoluted the people arguing don't even know what they are arguing about (and this goes double for emotional and relationship type arguments when the people have history together).  

--Secondly,   this technique demonstrates you are making an attempt to understand them and this will have a calming effect

--Thirdly, it forces you out of the frame of mind that you are automatically right and enables you to actually ""listen"" and ""hear"" what they are saying.

--Fourth, it helps you step outside the argument, see both sides, be more objective and able to see more solutions.

You can also do the reverse.  Pause the argument and ask ""Can you tell me what my argument is?  Can you explain the problem as I see it?

This forces them to pause and process what you are saying and it helps to break the momentum and out-of-control death spiral arguments tend to descend into.    And again, it helps to actually help define the EXACT problem...",LifeProTips

He said that he believes ""honesty is the best policy and that no one can handle real honesty these days."" Part of me thinks he has a point.

"[UPDATE] I have been paying for my entire apartment buildings water heating! And my landlord's response was: ""If you don't like it- just move out!""","[Here is the original post in case you are not up to date on the situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a05jq6/i_am_left_freezing_cold_in_my_apartment_as_i_pay/).

I have managed to uncover (for the most part) the cause of my exceptionally high hydro bills (averaging $400CAD a month) in my apartment in Ontario, Canada.

&#x200B;

Based on all of the advice I received from the original post ‚Äì here's what went down after the comments got locked:

&#x200B;

**I managed to get onto my online hydro account ‚Äì and discovered some very suspicious activity:**

* I noticed that each month was consistently high usage (every month I was consistently consuming around 2600 kWh. No matter the month ‚Äì no matter if I was or was not using air-conditioning or heating during the month.
* I also checked the specific weeks where I was on vacation. I was not home at all and everything in the apartment was turned off- I paid around $70 for each week I was away. A total of $140 I paid when I wasn't even home for two weeks!
* Furiously, I called the hydro company and asked them to look further ‚Äì she told me the usage she is seeing is very unusual ‚Äì it appeared as if the unit Is vacant (consistently high consumption without much deviation).
* She also Informed me that an inspector would be coming any day now...

**The inspector came to the apartment a few days ago, and accessed the meter (which was in the basement beneath the restaurant):**

* I was in school at this time so my boyfriend was there when the inspector came.
* The Inspector noticed that the plumbing in the apartment for the hot water supply feeding each unit (possibly also the restaurant) were combined.
* The closest tank in circuit (mine) was doing all or most of the work for the entire building! Feeding hot water to all the units.
* To prove this further, the hydro company closed the cold water intake to our apartment ‚Äì and we were still receiving hot water! Meaning the next closest tank in the circuit (our neighbor) was feeding our hot water.
* Also, our hot water tank was feeding the cold water intake of the nearest hydro tank (the apartment next to us).

After emailing the landlord multiple times and waiting days for a response from him ‚Äì he finally only came because now one of our neighbors was not receiving hot water. We noticed that he was in the basement doing something (probably fiddling around with the plumbing). After he left- we stopped receiving hot water ourselves. I had to shower at the neighbor's house yesterday because of this mess.

&#x200B;

**Yesterday my boyfriend confronted the landlord when he came to ""see what's going on.""** *My boyfriend recorded the entire conversation in case we will eventually need it to support our case.*

* Instead of getting a professional plumber to come and actually fix his mistakes. He is just poking and prodding at the hot water pipes (literally) and pretends as if he has any idea what he is doing.
* My boyfriend insisted that he get a certified plumber come and FIX this massive disaster - and the landlord just complained about money and says that *we* should do it. (as if we haven't already done enough).
* The landlord was just complaining the entire time and even said ""**If you don't like it- just move out!""**

**I am almost certain that the landlord was aware of what was going on with the pluming in the building before we moved in**

* Due to the fact that all the tenants before me have dealt with the same high hydro bills and have made complaints before (but they were all old and probably did not know that it was wrong, or what to do ‚Äì likely my landlords favorite kind of person).
* Since my boyfriend and I are having a hard time showering and washing the dishes with NO hot water ‚Äì we turned the hot water back on‚Ä¶ meaning at this point we are carrying the entire load for the building again.

**My question to all of you:**

1. What do I do now?... Can I trust my landlord to 'solve' this issue on his own ‚Äì even though his ""plumbers"" will likely be rehired to do the work if we do?
2. What happens to all the money that quite literally went down the drain for this - and is still currently going down the drain?
3. Do I need a lawyer?

Thanks to all of you again ‚Äì you have helped tremendously!

* Thank's to all of you who commented last night! - Unfortunately the comments got locked before I could even reply to any of you! 
* I am working on contacting some lawyers now  and calling the tenant board on Monday!

I think my (22M) girlfriend (20F) might be cheating on me with my roommate.,"My girlfriend and I have been together since high school. We go to the same college, and she basically lives me. We live in a 4 bedroom apartment with three others guys.

My roommates and I hang out a lot with my girlfriend, but she gets along especially well with one, we'll call him....Chet.

Chet is really close with my girlfriend. When I go to sleep (I go to bed really early), she goes and hangs out in his room. When I ask her about it, she tells me what good friends they are, and goes into detail about how she just could never even imagine his lips touching hers, that it makes her sick to think about. Part of me believes me, but part of me wonders why she goes into such detail about how repulsed she is by this idea.

Recently, they got into a fight because his girlfriend doesn't like my girlfriend. This fight ended in him buying her her favorite snacks and leaving them on our bed.

This seems like way intimate to be just a friendship to me, but I'm afraid to flat out ask her if they're sleeping together. I don't want to ruin our relationship over them just having a nice friendship. I don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments and encouragement. No, I did not set up a spy cam or try to walk in on them. 

I chickened out I think because I deep down didn't WANT to catch them in the act. Turns out I didn't need to.

I stayed quiet about it, which wasn't too hard because I was really busy with school this week anyway. Last night, my girlfriend told me we should throw a party at our apartment. I didn't really want to, but figured why the hell not, I could stand to get pretty drunk anyway. So last night we invited a ton of people over, which is not out of the ordinary for us, and my girlfriend invited her best friend. It started out as just a normal party, until Chet got raging drunk and announced to everyone that he had just broken up with his girlfriend of 3 years. So, I did something sort of manipulative that I'm not totally proud of.

I told my girlfriend's best friend, I'll call her Kim, that she should hook up with Chet. We had all been drinking a lot, and I sort of suspected she was down for Chet anyway, and she agreed enthusiastically. 

Cut to Chet sitting on our couch with Kim quite literally on top of him making out.

I pointed this out to my girlfriend, telling her it would be so great if our bestfriends dated eachother.

My girlfriend lost it. Like completely lost it. She started screaming and pushing Kim off of Chet, telling her she couldn't believe both of them would do that. She ended stopping the whole party because she made such a scene, and I just stood there and watched. When she finally snapped out of it and realized everyone was staring at her, I thanked her for confirming what I already knew, and told her to get the fuck out of my house.

That was last night. I'm still sort of in shock it went down like that. I went to bed right after, and haven't talked to anyone about it yet this morning. I don't really know how I can look Chet in the face after this, so I haven't left my room yet. ",relationship_advice
AITA for rejecting my dad's apology and not agreeing to donate my kidney to him?,"
My parents split up when I was about 7 years old because my dad had an affair and got another woman pregnant. My mom got full custody and my dad eventually stopped visiting my sister and I and stopped paying child support. He justified this as him not having enough money for us and his new family, but either way I had no contact with my dad for around 15 years. About a month ago, he tried to get back into contact with me and apologize for his actions in the past. However, today he asked if my sister and I could get tested as a match because he has kidney failure (which I had no idea about until now) and a possible donor. I rejected his request and told him I wasn't ready (or might never be ready) to forgive him for abandoning me and my sister until now and I suspect he only contacted us in order to get a donation out of us. After rejecting him, he sent a bunch of angry texts about how he would die without a donation from us and basically said I was murdering him. Some of my friends also said I should forgive him because he is my father and that I am the asshole for potentially letting him die without the kidney. So AITA?

Edit: His other kids are still pretty young (~15 and I'm not sure how many other kids he has but I think at least one other) so I'm not sure they are able to donate at their age. Also an update: my aunt (my dad's sister) who I also haven't spoken to since my dad left, just messaged me begging me to consider the donation. At this point I'm leaning towards blocking the whole family and just never looking back.

Edit2: Thank you for all your replies and advice. I've decided to block my father and his side of the family and so has my sister. I realize now that I shouldn't feel any guilt for not donating as this man is not truly my dad.",AmItheAsshole

Our schedules are quite opposite, I wake up for work at 6:30am, she sleeps in until 1pm for her night shift. I always go to sleep first, I need more sleep than the average person anyway (about 10 hours a night) and I always have to be up early in the morning. She slips in to bed in the first hours of the morning - sometimes I'm already asleep before she gets back from work, but most of the time I'm just getting ready for bed as she gets home.

I'm not really sure how this came to be in our schedule, but every night that I get in to bed before she does, she comes to kiss me goodnight and tuck me in. I love it, I think it's adorable and I'm kind of a clingy girlfriend so I enjoy it a lot! I'm just wondering if anyone else does this?

Recently we had a friend stay over (our place is too small to have many guests stay over so having someone stay the night is rare) and I went to bed early and left them to their Netflix, and my girlfriend said she'd come tuck me in soon.

Update - My (21M) girlfriend (22F) got into a wheelchair. Don't know if we're compatible anymore,"First off, wow. Apparently my thread blew up after I went to sleep. I didn't find out until the next morning, because my girlfriend told me about it. I was  so embarrassed and mortified. She had already read the whole thing and my comments. I honestly didn't know what to say I could only say I was so sorry and that I didn't want her to find out like this. She was calm.. Told me it was okay, said it touched her.. Can't really describe how I felt. We just held each other for a very long time. Might be weird but I knew I needed to be with her when she found out. I started thinking about a life without her, and I simply couldnt. I can't give up on this girl. We've talked a lot about 'us' the past few days, which was long overdue. I have apologized over and over.. She's so understanding and doesn't blame me for having doubts.. A person this special I won't find again, but I hate myself for having thought about breaking up. She's still the same person. I should have communicated my feelings to her. I'm a very lucky guy. I really do love her to the moon and back. 

Regarding therapy, I have called for an appointment but they have a few weeks of waiting time until they got time for me. Y'all were right. Can't hurt to give it a try, maybe I was unlucky with my former therapists. But I already feel wayyy better now that everything is out in the open. And the girl who I talked to I've cut off completely. My gf knew straight away who it was and wanted to warn me to stay away from her earlier, but she didn't want to come off as crazy. Didn't realize she was into me. We're doing some research so we can try to be intimate again but we got time, no hurry.

Thanks for the overwhelming support and replies. I was lost but I know everything will fall into the right place eventually.. I'm with her till the end. We're going to keep open communication, which will be priority. We're doing very well now. She knew something was up with me too, she knows me too well. Hope everyone here has a great day. Thanks.

AITA for despising my mentally handicap sister?,"The title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200B;

My sister is severely autistic. She requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. She is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. Despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200B;

I hate her. That should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200B;

I was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. Even since I can remember the world has revolved around her. I was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. All of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when I complained. Even when I was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me I was in the wrong.

&#x200B;

Along with this I am expected to take care of her and drop everything I do for her. I can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. Even when I do somehow get time to myself I am required to leave if they need me. If i do not then I am punished. The recent example of this is when I went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200B;

It seems as if I am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. This last week I was chosen to give a speech at a school event. I was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. Anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200B;

I've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. While talking about colleges with my father, he joked that I should get a degree that pays well so when their gone I can take care of my sister. I don't know why but this caused me to break down. I cried and screamed about how it always about her. I'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that I'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200B;

I've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. Am i the asshole here?

&#x200B;

Edit/Update kinda:

Wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. I never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. Thank you all. After thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that I don't despise my sister. It's not her fault that she was born the way she is. My parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but I was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. They have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. My parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best I leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. Thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

TIFU by having a seizure and going full MMA on the six cops trying to help get me in the ambulance,"Checking my email is the last normal thing I remember before waking up in the hospital, except for a few scary-as-fuck bits here and there. Hence, this comes from my own direct recollection, with the gaps filled in by my wife and other witnesses.

I had a full tonic-clonic seizure, right at my desk. Details are mostly irrelevant, here, but I've never had a seizure before. (And initial assessment is that it was probably a ""perfect storm"" situation with a new prescription I was on that will (hopefully) never happen again.)

My wife was in the next room and of course called 911, and the ambulance showed up. Problem is, I was [postictal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postictal_state?oldformat=true), which is a post-seizure state where you're essentially not in your right mind. But when two big dudes came into my house unannounced and in a big hurry to move towards me, I went into home-defense mode. The fact that they were clearly in EMT uniforms and there to help me was lost in the scrambled mess my brain was in, but my more basic instincts were working fine. I don't think I actually assaulted the EMTs, as they just kept their distance and radioed for police backup when I started yelling at them telling them (apparently) ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE. I DON'T WANNA FIGHT YOU.""

And so the police sent one guy.

Now I remember feeling extremely protective of my wife and convinced that this home invasion was serious business now that this 3rd guy was coming towards me and attempting to physically restrain me. I don't remember, but I'd bet you dollars to donuts that the millisecond he rolled his shoulders forward and widened his stance is the second that I went from uncooperative to full apeshit; it's just what you do when you're trained to fight and there doesn't seem to be another option, as when you are protecting your family like I thought I was about to have to do.

That's when things started getting ugly. I was an amateur MMA fighter about fifteen years ago with a local dojo, and while I haven't practiced for a long time, I can tell you those instincts never fully leave you. I know how to reverse any submission hold a local cop is likely to be able to proficiently attempt on me, apparently even whilst postictal. Before backup arrived, I had swept the leg of the officer and had him in an armbar. Thank fuck I didn't go for a blood choke whilst my brain was short-circuiting. I was also screaming (roaring, apparently) at my wife to call the police. The irony of my request was lost on me at the time. That primal roar was the scariest sound she's ever heard come out of my body, so she tells me, and I didn't stop roaring. Luckily (for him and me), cop #1 didn't put up any further resistance until his backup arrived.

Five more big dudes showed up (now 6 cops + 2 EMTs + my wife). No weapons drawn, no tasers. Fortunately they knew they were walking into a medical call, and boy they should get a medal for how well they handled it.

I wasn't going down without a fight, and 1v1 was no contest even though they were way above my weight class. But with sheer overwhelming force they pretty much wore me out and then dogpiled me to the ground, cuffed me in the back, and then stood me up to walk me to the ambulance. Big mistake. I easily spun my way out of the officer's control grip (hand on handcuff chain, other hand on my shoulder), and gave him a front kick to the breadbasket he probably won't forget anytime soon. ""Bring it, fuckers,"" I remember thinking (or saying? who knows). I also remember being this weird mix of scared, emboldened by my recent ""escape"", and pissed *right* the fuck off, all at the same time.

Still cuffed, front kicks were the new order of the day. I was like the goddamn free sample guy at the supermarket, giving them out to anyone who came near me. Details are loose on what happened next, but I guess they did some kind of brute force team tackle again and got me to the ground, and from the cuts on my wrists, they may have used some kind of pain compliance technique with the cuffs. It didn't work, as I was able to shrimp my way out from underneath the guy(s) on top of me and throw a nasty double heel kick from lying down. Fortunately it just grazed the guy on the shoulder rather than the neck/head, which is where I would certainly have been aiming.

Next thing I remember vividly is being face down on my living room carpet barely able to breathe (thanks to being out of shape these days, with at least one big guy on my back), and thinking this was the end for me, then they'd rape my wife, and let my cat out in the cold winter night.

They weren't screwing around at this point. Apparently judging it worth the risk, while I was pinned the EMTs shot me in the ass with some kind of chemical restraint, and the cops just sort of sat on me and let my wife try to calm me down until it had taken full effect and I was strapped to the gurney in soft restraints.

When I woke up (over a full day later--combination of insomnia + seizure + downers + 1v6 cage match really wore me out, I guess), I was bruised to shit, but aside from some minor cuts on my wrists from the cuffs and a nasty hole in my bottom lip from me biting it during the seizure, I'm a lot better off than I could have been. I have some nasty pins and needles in my hands so those cuffs must have been torqued fairly hard (by me or the cops, who knows), but I'm told by my attending doctor that should go away in about six months(!).

When got home I called the police to apologize and thank them for getting my combative ass to the ambulance. Thanks to them for being incredibly good sports about the whole thing. (And not pressing charges, especially given my level of...enthusiasm.)

I'm still trying to wrap my head around just how badly this *could* have gone. Yeesh. The unpredictable seizure alone is bad enough without nearly suiciding-by-cop had there been a weapon within reach. Scares the bejesus out of me just knowing how absolutely out of control I was.

tl;dr: I learned exactly how many big dudes with at least basic hand-to-hand training it takes to drag me from my home against my will. (Six, plus a syringe of something in the ass.)

EDIT: Well, this was a much bigger response than I expected. Thanks for all of your comments (especially those from police and medical professionals and other patients that have gone through something similar). And, wow, thanks for the gold, kind strangers.

"(WA) Neighbor who took cringe pictures with my car ia threatening me for ""ruining his reputation""","Y'all, the saga continues. I'm on mobile and don't know how to link my previous post but here's a summary: an idiotic neighbor kept taking pictures of and with my vehicle in our underground garage and posted them on social media claiming the car is his. 

I thought this dumbass needs a dose of online shaming so here's what I did. His social media accounts have a pretty high followership (10-12k) and as others suggested, he is indeed some kind of ""guru"" scammers. I don't really wanna say what type of scammer for privacy reasons (not that he deserves any). Well, I only have Twitter so I took it there. During his last photoshoot with my car, I took a few photos for evidence. I chose one of those pictures, tagged him in the tweet and wrote: ""I see [his handle] loves my car. That's cool but would be nice if he didn't try to brag about a car he doesn't own. This is him during one of the photoshoots in our shared garage."" 

Of course, it didn't take long until 1) dude deleted ALL the pictures of my car and 2) contacted me to threaten a lawsuit for libel (?) if I don't apologize to HIM publicly for embarrassing him in front of his ""fans"" and delete said Tweet. My ass was laughing so hard. I didn't reply which seemed to only piss him off even more because he was sending me angry emojis and curse words. I should also that my tweet gained traction and has around 120 replies and 300 RTs (I'm getting famous too!). Mostly, people are bashing him and saying what a retard he is. Others started making fun of his other posts (eg ""I'm starting to doubt he actually ate at that restaurant. Probably just took a picture and left""). Moreover, this scammer apparently claimed on social media that he lives on a mansion on Lake Washington and some of the commenters put two and two together and realized that he is actually my neighbor and there is no mansion. 

This dude basically says that it is my fault that all these people are making fun of him and that I am destroying his business (?). I'm not particularly afraid of his lawsuit and my lease ends next month after which I will be moving out so I don't really care. My question is, did I do something legally wrong? Can that be considered libel?

My son attends daycare and last month, caught pertussis (whooping cough). He was hospitalized for two days but he pulled through. We realized he had missed several vaccines, so after he recovered, we got him caught up.

Last week at visitation, the caseworker mentioned this to biomom who freaked out about poisoning her baby and giving her autism. He (caseworker) explained that this wasn't the case, and that we're trying to protect him from illness, especially at his daycare. She said we violated her religious rights. (Religion has never come up before.)

We kind of brushed it off because she is always exaggerating things to get her son back (which is expected). She's also complained that she didn't want her son raised by two women but there weren't other foster parents available at the time (according to the social worker). But today she emailed us that she has a lawyer and she will take us to court for damages to her son. He hasn't been damaged by the vaccines at all, beyond a basic booboo.

Can she really take us to court? Does she have a case? My wife said I'm overreacting and that the judge will throw it out, but I'm not so sure. What documents do I need to make my case?

Edit: thank you all for the advice! (My wife is now using it to say ""I told you so."") We emailed the caseworker but haven't heard anything yet; it's a Saturday though, so we'll probably hear from him on Monday or Tuesday. I'll let you know if anything changes.",legaladvice

TIFU by telling a girl I suck a lot of dick.,"This happened yesterday. I'm 23M and I study IT and as you can imagine we have a lot more guys than girls over here.

Backstory: So our small group of friends includes one girl and 3 guys including me and we make a fair number of sexist and racist jokes. When someone in the group says something and another person misses it and asks to repeat it, we tell that person that ""You know what makes you deaf? Sucking a lot of dick"". Okay saying it like this sounds pretty stupid but believe me it's funny in person. 

The fuckup: I'm going home from university and I'm standing in the bus stop. My phone starts to ring. For some reason I don't notice it and it just keeps ringing. Eventually a girl comes up and tells me that she thinks my phone is ringing. A normal person would have said ""Ohh thanks"" but what did I say? Of course I said ""Oh well you know I suck a lot of dick"". She just stared at me for a second and then walked to the opposite end of the bus stop. FML.

TL;DR: Didn't notice that phone rang, random girl alerts me, I tell her that I suck a lot of dick because it's an inside joke.",tifu

TIFU by wearing reflective glasses to a poker game,"Mandatory this didn't happen today, it happened Saturday night.

So me and my friends have a Saturday night poker game, and this time we decided to spice it up and play for money. We all brought in 100$ to  start. Now this is where I fucked up. I bought these new pair of aviators that I really liked and made me look really cool. So I decided to wear them to the game, which was inside. I hoped it would improve my poker face, which is lacking. It was also sunset, and the sun was hurting my eyes as I was facing the window. I proceed to have the worst game of my life. They knew exactly when to call my bluff and when to fold. It was like magic, I couldn't get it. I went out super quickly. They continued playing until the end, and as we were leaving I told my friends ""you guys have balls of steel!"" My friends started laughing like crazy, and I asked them what gives. They said, ""you know those glasses are reflective, right?"" And I realize they could see every hand I had through my glasses. They laughed and handed me 50$ as compensation.

"WIBTA for not going to my sisters wedding because of the ridiculous ""requirements""","So, i'm in the middle of a shitstorm and need some advice on if i'm wrong.

&#x200B;

My sister is getting married in less that 3 weeks. I haven't been involved in the planning as I have my own life but from what my mom has relaid to me it's been a nightmare. My sister want's a ""fancy"" wedding and is micro-managing everything. I have no idea how normal this is but from what i've heard she broke down crying when her fiance bought the wrong shade of white napkins. Her and both my and the grooms parents have invested a lot of money into this too the tune of over 50k.

&#x200B;

In my opinion I think the whole ordeal is ridiculous but it's not really my place to say anything. At least until yesterday. A email was sent out to everyone invited to the wedding with ""attendance requirements"". These requirements were a joke. Some of them were just nonsensical like what color ties are and aren't allowed or that no one can talk to the wife or groom alone. But some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. The worst though were the ""gift requirements"". According to the email a gift of 300$ value or more MUST be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. The email also ends with ""Those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. Please think of the bride and groom's wishes during this stressful time""

&#x200B;

This is a joke, right? Like I can understand micromanaging but that's just absurd. I called my mom to make sure this was not a late April fools joke and it was real. I told her that I won't be going because of this. That was wrong apparently because my sister has been blowing me up saying that I'm being selfish and that i'm ruining ""her day:. My parents agree with her and say i'm being an asshole. My parents have told me that they will pay for my gift but I still think that all of these rules are a joke.

TIFU by ruining my teachers life.," 

So like every other post this didn't happen today and this story will be kept as vague as possible while still telling the story because I don't want people to find out who i am lol..

In order to understand why this all happened I have to explain that I was in high school and was dating a girl we will call Samantha, well when I started dating Samantha I was friends with her sister Joselyn beforehand and it turns out that Joselyn had a thing for me that I was oblivious to. Anyways I thought she had gotten over it as me and Samantha had been dating for over 2 years already and there never seemed to be any sort of bad blood between the three of us. This is where the fuck up happened.. One day in school my girlfriend and I decided to skip class and were walking in the halls when we saw that a teacher had left their room open (Without going too much into detail this teacher had the biggest room due to the type of class they taught.) so we decided to go in there to skip class and being horny teenagers we started doing more than just talking and hanging out... After that Samantha decides to tell Joselyn what we did because it was super crazy and full of adrenaline... This is how I found out that Joselyn was still holding resentment after all this time. She told her parents about what Samantha and I did in that classroom and her parents called the school which lead to an investigation on the teacher to see if he was leaving his door unlocked on purpose to allow the students to go in there and do as they please, the whole investigation put a strain on an already weak marriage the teacher was in which lead to a divorce and the teacher was found ""At fault"" for not locking his door and condoning this behavior so he was forced to resign and basically the teacher wont be allowed to teach again in our district.. the teacher is now working at a local grocery store baking cookies and basically I will always remember this shit as I feel AWFUL and dont know what to do or fix it.

TL;DR - Had sex in a teachers classroom which lead to the teacher having a divorce, and being forced to resign.

Massachusetts.,"I posted [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6n6lrr/phd_student_here_being_accused_of_plagiarism_only/) about a plagiarism situation with the university in my PhD thesis.

To make it short, a few sentences in the thesis was too similar to what I had said in a couple of papers and my masters thesis. This wasn't a direct copy & paste, and  it was 7 sentences (53 words) out of my thesis which was a little over 95,000 words.

Last week I got an automated email that an investigation has been started on the recommendation of the person that I talked to. The email explained that in case scientific misconduct is found, I will have a chance to defend my case to the board and the board will decide what to do, which vary from a simple revision and resubmission to presenting the case to the diciplinary committee for a serious offense.

I asked for appointments with a few people. Head of the department, dean of students, and a head tutor to ask for advice. I haven't managed to see any of them yet.

Today, I received an email that the investigation is over and they have found no evidence of misconduct or plagiarism. They apologized for the stress that this has caused. A little later, I received another email from the head of the committee personally apologizing for this mess, and explaining that the officer who I talked to had gone fishing rather than doing the standard practice which is not the policy.

So that's that. Now I can graduate in peace. I cancelled the appointments and decided not to pursue the potential racism situation as there's no point anymore. Thanks all for advice. ",legaladvice

There needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before I even begin to give a shit about Fat acceptance for women.,"Perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but I'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but I talk to gay men a lot. (I've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

I don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. How emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. My size isn't great either but I've come to accept it, however, I know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

When I see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, I laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. A man can't. A woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. Why should I focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

The rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. Many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. While it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

Edit: as an addendum, I'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

All I can say is fuck most of you. You treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. Thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. It was luck of the God damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. While the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. Even though I accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) I know I could have it a lot worse and many men do. I still have it in the back of my mind that whoever I'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. I'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**Edit 2: I would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

I didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. I'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

Firstly I'd like to address this ludicrous notion that I hate women. I dont know how I can prove to any of you that I dont hate women other than me saying I dont. I may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. My problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

I understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. No one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. My main point was I believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **I never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) I simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. I get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. But from where I'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. Perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case I apologize and acknowledge my fault. And before anyone addresses it, I'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. That was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and I used penis size as an example. What I really want is inclusivity. Of everyone. 

Another topic I'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" While I understand the logic, I dont really see how its productive. Sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. Many of us crave it, strive for it. Make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. When a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. If left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. I understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. But I feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. Which is why I'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. But I feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. And I agree with that, but all I'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

I obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but I believe I'm a bit of an idealist. For better or worse, I sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. Whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

Another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. Many thought I was an asshole in my post and I would agree with that. I admit I'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why I dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. Many suggested that I should start the movement myself, but I'm simply not the right person for the job. I'm hot headed, I sometimes don't think before I speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. I'm a private person, despite how I am online with anonymity, in real life I am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. I also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. I see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" I knew there would be opposition to this post and I was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. Perhaps rightly so, because I'm a bit of a dick. But love me or hate me, I stand by most of what I said. 

I sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. Supporting one particular group. (Culturally speaking I'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) I care about people despite what many of you may believe. And all I really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (Aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

The last major point I'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. Somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. I'll admit that sure, I wish I had a bigger dick. I feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part I can tolerate it. I've had partners who didn't care and I genuinely believe them. I know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. So you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

One last thing is I really do appreciate the discussion. There are a lot of points I strongly disagree with that I didn't address here, and there are many ideas I really should think over and reevaluate myself. And I thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",unpopularopinion

Anyway, I recently found out they had sex and kinda dated shorty before we started dating. Is it wrong being hurt?","Hi Reddit,

French guy here, so please excuse my English. But I guess you'll get the point.

Long story short: there was this guy and I always kind of felt like he and my now-gf have had something in the past. I know him and saw him occasionally. However, my gf and I started dating about two years ago and we made fun of this guy on a regular basis and she assured me she had never ever dated this guy nor had there been any feelings between them both. I believed her, since she was looking straight in my eyes when saying these things with a confidence that I would've never doubted that this was the truth. 

Fast forward: we started dating and about two months in the relationship she got a message from that guy asking if she wanna meet the week after to get some drinks, since he was in Paris that day. She told me and asked if I was cool with her meeting that guy next week. Well, I am not really cool with it, but fuck it, he's a friend and who am I to tell her who she is allowed to meet anyway. I told her so. However, I was kind of hurt and also angry (kept this for myself) that she didn't ask if I wanted to join her - I would've not wanted to join (he's a jerk, seriously!), but I somehow think it would have been appropriate to ask though. I would have asked her if I was in her place. 

I told her that I feel uncomfortable that she's gonna meet him.. in the late evening..just the two of them..having drinks..without me. She got annoyed and was arguing with me, giving me the feeling that I was totally wrong and that she really wanted to meet a friend of hers and that it's me who is keeping her from doing so because I was an overly jealous macho (which I am not at all). So I gave in and told her that if she wanted to go and see him, she shall do it. She did,

I was annoyed, but told myself that I had no right to feel this way and with some time passing by I didn't really think of it anymore. A couple of months later I was looking for some documents that I needed for an appointment the following day and, accidentally, found a nice looking scratchpad. I didn't know it and wanted to see if it was empty and if so I would've used it for work notes (I have lots of such pads). So I was rapidly skimming the pages, not expecting or looking for anything and - there was his NAME, literally jumping me in the eye! I wouldn't have read a single word if I hadn't read his name - it was like ""Fuck! Please let it be something trivial."". But it wasn't trivial at all: 

She was in love with him, she even wrote it down many many times, and when I asked her she always told me that they had something a few months before we dated. So all the times we made fun of him being an idiot, every time she told me that she would've never go out with him, that he was just a friend..... All lies, lies she has told me right in my face. And then she would go out with him when we were already dating for months and making me feel uncomfortable because I didn't want her to see him that evening?! 

I was shattered and probably still am. It's that she lied to my face, making an idiot out of me by making fun of him though knowing she had something with him, and telling me she wouldn't even see him as a male so she could see him that evening. What. The. Fuck, 
Sure I was playing things through in my head, everyone is afraid of being hurt, but I seriously NEVER EVER would have thought that SHE would do something like this to me (or anyone else), she's a perfect partner, who just would not do ""such things"". I was so wrong and couldn't really handle my emotions and broke down for the rest of the day, still being in ""fights"" with my mind which fucks with me from time to time. I still think that I am not knowing all about what was going on with him and her and sometimes it's killing me inside. 

I love this woman from the bottom of my heart and I am sure she is ""the one"" for me so I never even thought about leaving her, because I never would. And I have no doubt that she loves me, too. But it hurts so badly and I just had to get this off my chest, hoping there are people who can tell me what they did when they have been in such a situation. What eases the pain and what can I do to trust my partner again 100%? I don't want this to be something that haunts me all my life.

Thanks.

TL;DR
GF met with a guy we both know for dinner and drinks. Didn't ask me to join them and most importantly, she lied about sleeping with him shortly before we dated although I asked her exactly this many times because I always thought they have had something going on in the past.

"Rover.com dog sitter lost my dog, hindered his recovery and damaged my work contract in the process.","I hired a well reviewed [rover.com](https://rover.com) dog sitter to watch my dog on Fri in order for me to work on a contract out of the city. I dropped my dog off at the sitter's house at noon on Fri, and at 8:30pm he sends me a message letting me know that my dog had escaped. (something about his girlfriend and a open door) I break my work contract and race back to the city to start looking for him, and posted his info on several social media sources to get as much exposure as possible. I find out through Bunz and FB that my dog was sighted about a kilometer away at 6:30pm, so this guy waited several hours before letting me know that my dog was missing.

I get into the city and start looking on foot. He informs me that he has called the police and TAS (toronto animal services) and has ordered a set of missing posters to put up in the neighbourhood trough Rover. He then tells me that he has a bunch of friends and family canvassing the neighbourhood looking for him. Great right? This is where things get unpleasant.

It's -10C outside and as it gets later and my search gets wider I realize that i'm the only one looking for my dog. I call [rover.com](https://rover.com) repeatedly and they say that all they can do on their end is encourage the sitter to go out and look, but apart from that their hands are tied. I get a tip from Facebook that a dog similar to mine was brought in to TAS, but I needed to call them for a more accurate description. I call TAS when they open on Sat morning at 8am, and discover that it isn't my dog. At that point they inform me that they never received a missing dog report for my dog the night before, and that I would have to submit one myself. (+12h after he went missing) This is the first confirmed lie from this dog sitter.

I continue my search throughout the morning with no leads, I double back into the neighbourhood and still don't see any missing posters or anyone else searching. I finally get a tip off to his location through Facebook and catch up with my dog at a park that he is semi-familiar with around lunch time. This is after 17h straight of walking in -10C weather. I covered every street & alleyway in a 3 sq kilometer area because I was scared to death that my dog was going to get hit by a car and/or freeze to death. I couldn't stand the thought of going home without him.

I speak to [rover.com](https://rover.com) again, and on a hunch ask for the missing poster order number and location. It turns out they were never collected from the Staples that printed them. So this guy never had any posters in his possession and was never distributing them. I have them now as evidence.

&#x200B;

Emotions aside, is there any course of action I can take to deal with this person? By lying about the search, the posters and the TAS report he delayed valuable search tools that I could have procured myself and used in the search immediately. I also lost $1000 by breaking this work contract and have documentation to that effect. 

This guy really should not have any animal in his care, and pretending to go through the motions is worse than simple negligence like leaving a door unsecured. I'm at a loss for how to proceed. (If at all) 

Edit: to clarify I did eventually find my dog, he's safe but it was a hellish experience.

TIFU by trying to have a threesome with my girlfriend.,"So this happened last night. My girlfriend and I have been trying to have a threesome for a while now but could never really find the right girl. Yesterday she reconnected with one of her old middle school friend and they were hanging out at the mall. She called me and asked if they could come by my place after for some drinks and I agreed.

They come over around 9pm and my girlfriend gave me that look. I knew that she talked to her about having a threesome with us and the girl agreed to it. So I play some music and bring out some drinks. Everything is going good until she brings out her own stash of alcohol and weed.

The girl brought two 4Locos and starts chugging. (For those who don't know 4Locos is this really harsh alcoholic drink that's 4 servings of alcohol in one can that can really fuck you up.) She has two of them. Then she rolls a blunt and smokes it. (I didn't drink or smoke at all) By that time my girlfriend is tipsy from the Hennessy I have and starts making out with me. The girl is on the bed watching and obviously starts getting turned on. But a few minutes later she told us she's really tired and wants to go back home. I'm bummed out but we all get in the car and I drive her home.

I'm driving her home down these dark back roads. The whole time she's telling us how she loves having us as friends and that she's sorry for being so tired and all that. Then she starts gagging and making pre vomit sounds I guess? Anyways I pull over to the side of the road so she can do her business. She gets out and starts sprinting down the road (Rip Me) I start chasing her down the the dark road and I catch up. She looks me dead in the face and asked me who I was. I told her I'm her friend and that she's not feeling well and my girlfriend and I was taking her home. She's says ok but continues to walk away and a car goes by. She waves her arms and screams for help and I grab  her saying wtf are you doing? Then she bites the shit out my hand. I let go and she runs into the street. I'm a black guy with dreads and she's a skinny white girlfriend so the sight of me chasing her is pretty comical. She managed to flag down a truck, a man and wife, and begs them for help. My girlfriend pulled up and very calmly told her friend to get back in the car. The girl screamed get away from me hides in the bush. The couple calls the police. The police showed up and asked everyone questions and took the girl back to her parents place.

No sex was had but instead I got a few cuts from the bite so that's kinda kinky I guess.

Tl:dr- Girlfriend comes over with her friend for a threesome. Friend gets drunk and high instead and runs away. Friend freaks out and bites my hand and strangers calls the police. Police takes her home

Update- I'm going to go to the clinic soon to have it checked and I'm going to try and upload pictures as well. My girl friend tried to get in contact with the girl but no response. We'll stop by her apartment along the way

"I (38M) Irishman recently found out I have a Brazilian daughter (19F) I knew nothing about because her mother never told me. DNA proved she is mine, but there is a serious language barrier.","19 years ago I met a Brazilian girl who was friends with my Brazilian buddy who worked and lived in Ireland. She came over to Ireland to study and joined our group of friends, we grew close and to put it bluntly we had sex many times. She couldn't stick Ireland's climate though and found the culture too different and went back to Brazil, she wanted me to apply and move with her back to Brazil. but I was in Brazil before with my buddy in the late 90's, lovely country, but the climate and culture I found too alien, just like she viewed Ireland as too alien. She eventually came to understand and all that shite, we broke up and we went our seperate ways. Sadly never heard from her after that. I moved on. 

Fastforward to half a year ago I'm at home after long day at work, doorbell rings, I answer the door and there she is again, this time with a young woman beside her. She explains that the girl is my daughter. I instantly believe it to be a real possibility, the girls age matches up to when we were together, she is quite fair and has similiar green eyes to me, and me and her mother did not have protected sex. I invite them in to ask all the standard questions. The girl really started to get emotional and cried and got angry at her mother and then looked at me crying asking in broken English was I really her Papa? I said I don't know, but we can do a DNA test and find out which her mother translated to her.  We did the DNA test as fast as possible due to the fact they aren't EU citizens so only had a certain amount of time here and weren't here on work visas. Did the DNA test and yup, it turns out i'm her papa. I'm overjoyed, I never had kids in the 19 years since, always felt bad that I was a 38 guy without a family, as I've never been good at staying in long term relationships. I am quite pissed at her mother, her explanation was that I wouldn't move with her to Brazil so I was no longer relevant to her, pregnant or not, the only reason she brought our girl to finally meet me is because my daughter kept begging to know who her father and she decided once my daughter was an adult she would bring her over to meet her father. This is warped and fucked, but what matters now is my daughter and not her mother. 

&#x200B;

Anyway now that the backstory in out of the way. My daughter is getting Irish citizenship as I am her father and am Irish which allows her to. Her mother has gone back to Brazil. She is living with me now for the time being and wants to get to know me better, she is very affectionate and we get along amazingly she is into many of the same movies, genres as I am which allows us to connect despite the language barrier. I will never get used to being called ''Papa'' though as in Ireland we call our parents, Da, daddy or dad. She is going to start learning English via tutor. She finds the language very difficult at the moment and I have been trying to personally help her learn it as best I can too, but it can be frustrating when trying to communicate with her.  I am crap at languages and can only understand a few key Portugese words. She has quickly filled a hole In my life, is a joy and I feel like I have a lot to life for.

My father is abusive towards my mom (serious),"Throwaway.

I didn't come here to tell a story, and sorry for the bad english but I don't know what to do, my father (38) hits my mom (37). Only her, he doesn't hit me (14) or my little sister (5). But still, we are afraid of him.

Some quick context: my mom wants to divorce my dad because he cheated on her 3 times and still does to this day but when she brings that up he gets crazy and insults her and hits her (not as hard to kill her or do some serious damage, but she still gets bruises). When he gets drunk he also gets really mad and does the same thing but this time he threatens me when I intervene.

Also, we live in Argentina if that matters.

I'm really sorry if this is not the place but I really want this to stop ~~(tell me a better site/subreddit and I'll delete the post)~~ this started in 2013 and it's not stopping. My mom doesn't want to call the police because she is afraid they'll just let him go and make him REALLY mad. I don't want my sister to go through this, I already got used to it.

Cheating? Found a clean sock that is not mine.,"I believe my girlfriend is cheating or has cheated, am I crazy? I've been together with her for about 6 years and live together. I'm not the jealous type, the type of guy who questions friends, or snoops throuh phones. There are no clear cut signs of infidelity except for two recent events that were odd. The first event, we enter her car and I get a hint a cigarette smoke, nothing crazy but odd considering neither of us smoke. I say out loud ""it smells like cigarettes in here"" she then starts acting very weird and changes the subject while still acting off. Brushed it off, never smelled like cigarettes again. The second and more alarming sign was going through my clean clothes and finding a single men's white sock, alarming because I only wear black and our laundry is done at home, not at a laundromat. I question it this time a bit more sternly but without accusations, ""it's not mine, it's not yours, who's is it?"" The response was I don't know possibly when you used to do laundry at the laundromat (meaning I took it without knowing). While this response seems totally feasible I have to remind everyone that we have our own washer and dryer, i haven't used a laundromat in 3 years and when I did it was before I lived where I do now, lastly in the past 2-3 years I'm certain I would have noticed a single white sock in my sock drawer. So I'm asking everyone for help, is she cheating? Other than being up front, what should I do to have more concrete evidence towards my suspicion? Thanks.",relationship_advice
I'm a guy and I wish I could be pregnant,"I think pregnancy is wonderful. I know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. I supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and¬†I helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. I know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. I wish I could do it, though.


My wife and I agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. Thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (I really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


She loved being pregnant.¬†Every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. I kissed her belly hundreds of times. And I fell in love with her all over again every time I looked at her. Her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. The bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


The hardest part about it is that I'll never be able to realize this wish and I never had a choice in the matter. Women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. And I don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. Maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. I know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant I'd consider it. I would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant I could get pregnant.


Every guy I've ever told has either looked at me like I'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. Women I've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. She knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. Any guys out there agree with me?


Edit: Some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. I do not disagree. However, I disagree that I have an idealized view of pregnancy. Just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. As I stated above, I am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

Edit 2: No, it's not a sexual thing. Also, to clarify, I am happy as a straight male and I do not want to transition to become a woman.",unpopularopinion

TIFU by mishearing what my teacher said to me,"This happened to me 21 years ago!So, halfway through grade 4, my family and I moved from Texas to Colorado. To help me get accustomed to my new classmates and not be overwhelmed on my first day, my teacher had me come in early and sit at my desk while the other students came in. While I was nervously awaiting the arrival of my new classmates my teacher walked over and gave me a warning.

""Now, the girl in front of you is a dork. Please don't make fun of her.""

Hearing this, the nine-year-old me instantly came to this poor girl's defence. The teacher had just called her a dork, and I thought this was extremely mean. So I tried to help this unmet girls aid by showing our camaraderie to the teacher:

""That's okay, there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I used to be one too!"" After admitting this to my teacher I was suddenly overcome with a fear that teacher would think of me as a dork forever, abandoning my plan of trying to help this girl I quickly added, ""But then I grew out of it.""

The teacher gave me the most puzzled look I have ever seen and seemed like she was about to say more but decided against it and left.All the kids came in and sat down at their desk and I looked up at the girl in front of me and realized I had misheard what my teacher said. The girl wasn't a dork; she was a dwarf. I had just told the teacher I used to be a dwarf, but I had grown out of it.

tl;dr Misheard the teacher and then told her I used to be a dwarf but grew out of it.

"If you're pro-choice, then you need to support the right to assisted suicide","It's the same concept IMO. For women, it's their body and they have the right to choose whether or not to keep the child. I think the same concept should apply to suicide. If someone is miserable, depressed, chronically ill, disabled, etc, then it should be 100% their choice to end their lives. It's inhumane to force people to take their own lives using makeshift methods which can result in brain damage or permanent injury (Shotgun, nitrogen gas, etc). Obviously there should be safeguards to prevent spur of the moment suicides after a traumatic event or something, but the option for a safe, sanctioned suicide should be there after proper vetting.

Edit: 

A lot of people are agreeing and saying ""I agree with this only for terminally ill people in pain."" My entire point is that you shouldn't be able to pick and choose who gets to kill themselves.

That's like saying only rape victims or medically vulnerable mothers should be allowed to get abortions. Anyone should have access to a safe and reliable method of suicide, regardless of why they're doing it.",unpopularopinion

"Accidentally 'drink and dashed' yesterday, would it be stupid of me to go back today and pay the tab? (EU)","So there's this bar me and my bf semi-regularly go to, recently they changed the way they serve drinks. You used to have to go to the counter, order, they gave you your drink, you paid then and there, done. Now they have a server who goes to your table and it all works like in a restaurant. Except yesterday we kinda forgot that when we finished our drinks (a cocktail and a beer, about $4 all in all) and left. This morning it kinda occurred to my bf that we forgot to pay.

I know morally going back and paying is the right choice. But what if they won't take the money and instead want to get the cops involved? Because right now they don't have any identifying information of us aside from descriptions, but if I go back and essentially confess, that's pretty damning, so should I go back and pay our tab?

Edit: this all happened in Eastern Europe, part of the EU.

Update: I felt really guilty so I went back there around opening hours. They were extremely above and beyond nice about it. Apologized and explained the situation. They said it was nice of me to come back, but there was nothing missing from the till so there's no bother. I'm pretty sure we didn't pay so I insisted, but they were like ""Don't sweat it, if you really didn't pay then this round was on the house."" Tbh I'm so embarrassed I probably won't go back there for a long while, but I am glad I tried to do the right thing.

AITA for cutting my mother out of my life for letting me be homeless?,"Back in 2009 when the economy tanked I lost my job, my car, my apartment, my girlfriend. Basically everything. At first I didn't want anyone to know what had happened so I stayed at a friends house for a week while I looked for a new job. But his landlord told me guests couldn't stay for more than 7 days at a time in a 30 day period. So I asked my mother if I could stay with her while I looked for a job. I told her I'd be on the street homeless if she didn't help me and she still decided to refuse to help me. Fast forward 2 months, I've been sleeping on the streets for every night still unable to secure a job. Even something like Safeway or McDonald's. My dad finds out that I'm homeless and sends me a ticket to come live with him in NJ and I accept. Within a week I have a job and in 3 months I'm in my own place again. It's been 10 years since then and I haven't spoken to my mother because of what I perceive to be a betrayal. She attempts to contact me frequently and I ignore it. AITA for cutting her out of my life? 

TL;DR mother let me be homeless and I never forgive her.

Edit: I have already cut ties. I haven't spoken to her in 10 years. It's my siblings telling me that I am the asshole that prompted this post.

Edit: people keep asking for her reasoning and all I can say is what she said to me. She said she couldn't afford to let me stay. But all I was asking for was a place to sleep. Not money, or food. I was getting a small unemployment check and eventually I got food stamps. I could have contributed. 

Edit: I guess I also have to say that I never asked my parents for anything. I've earned everything I have. I am not a drug user and I have never been. I don't drink and I've been the most responsible of all the children. Oh and my post should probably be she let me STAY homeless instead of let me be homeless.",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by sleeping with my landlord,"okay so this happened over the weekend and today. 
On Friday, i went to view an apartment. I had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. 
So i see the apartment, everything's great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. 

I get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. I'm going to go in on monday to sign the lease. 

Okay so now it's Saturday night and i'm just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let's call him steve
he messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. 

So monday rolls around and I go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends

I walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. 

The woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve's WIFE. steve looks totally chill, while i'm freaking outside but trying to remain calm. I did not sign up for this. 

Anyway, i feel bad for his wife and i feel like a horrible person even though i had no idea that he was married.

My dad (52M) has been inappropriate with me (18F).,"I live with my mom, dad and a younger sister. My dad is usually home for 5 months during which he has a break before taking up projects the rest of the year. 

 I turned 18 last year, he's been at home for 2 months now. I have a room of my own, my sister chooses to sleep with me at times and sometimes with my parents. I usually sleep without locking my door. About a month and a half ago, my dad enters my room at around 2 am in the morning, waking me up asking for sexual favors. I'm usually a deep sleeper and this woke me right up, was traumatizing - I immediately screamed at him, asking him to go away from my room locking the door in the process. I couldn't sleep the entire night, the morning was only worse - though I never feared going to the table for breakfast, he behaved as though everything was normal. My mom only knows there was an issue back then, but doesn't know the details. 

&#x200B;

I have been locking my door ever since that day. Over the course of 2 months, this has repeated 3 times now - having him knock the door, waking me up. I only opened it the first time, asking him never to do it again nor enter my room. The other times, I only was left wide awake and never did open the door. I never could sleep properly ever since and always check under the door to see who it is.

&#x200B;

Early this morning, my sister had an event to attend to and she woke up early, knocked the door. After confirming it was her (half asleep), I let her in in order for her to take her clothes and leave with mom. My sleep cycles are bad, my health isn't in good shape though I do try my best to keep fit. I fall asleep, without the door locked. I'm woken up by dad - touching me inappropriately, forcing me down and asking me to co-operate. I used to exercise earlier and am quite strong physically so I could forcibly get myself away. I was trembling, my mind unable to process anything - all I could do was to scream at him and lock the door behind him. 

&#x200B;

He crossed a line I was hoping I could prevent and I feel rotten inside. I can't seem to get it out of my head. My dad has always served to be an inspiration for me - I always used to look up to him and this ruins a lot of things for me. I feel helpless. I never got to spend much time with dad and wasn't closer to mom than I was with him because of the time he spent away. I used to look forward to time with him and now I just wish he were gone. 

&#x200B;

Distance never really helped with our relationship with dad. Mom and dad were on the verge of splitting up for the same.  But he means the world to her. No one else including us sisters could ever giver her anything like how she enjoys her time with him. He makes her the happiest and how she treasures him is special. She hasn't been working for quite some time now. The sole source of income is from dad. 

It would be selfish of me to break it to mom. It would break her and I don't wish for that to happen. Dad being the only source of income would mean if I ever broke it to mom and they decided to split - my sister's (13) education would be at a stake and we could never be able to live the way we do. I have friends, cousins I know I can rely on - (though none of them know) but mom's usually at home and fin's comfort only with dad. I find myself cornered, and can't really seem to find hope in anything. I feel broken and devastated. My true sense of inspiration is destroyed. 

Things could probably never be the same again. I just hope there's a way out - one in which neither mom nor my sister would have to face the brunt because of me. I have thought it over, and I don't think it would get better wrt dad until I could do something about it - however selfish it may be.  The only way out is I see is to wait until the end of three more months. I'm halfway there perhaps.

TIFU by c*mming so hard I fainted,"So this happened a couple of days ago..

Had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. After changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, I went to visit a dermatologist. Anyways, turns out I have a skin condition called Pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. So she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. Anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. After showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and I sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. I noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( Rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back REAALLLYYY good. So naturally I took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. Naturaly I decided to take it to the next logical level: Flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (Yes I know this sounds mildy retarded). What ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. I busted a nut so hard I started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and I fucking fainted. My parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a REAAAL worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. So yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. FML

TL;DR: Found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided I wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. Came so hard I went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

I'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol

TIFU by suggesting to my bf that he get testicle implants,"I've been dating this guy for a few months. He has a fetish for petite Asian girls, that I know. But he also has a thing for big breasts, which I attribute to his ""hentai porn"" fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. 

In the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. He would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me I'd be ""perfect"" if I got some saline implants to fill a DD cup, as a ""joke"" of course. (DD is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34C, but still insulting to me.)

So I finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. I told him most petite Asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. He did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great I'd look in a double D while we were out having brunch. 

So I snapped, and I said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. Well he didn't take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. He hasn't returned any of my texts since. 

TL;DR: I underestimated how fragile my bf's ego is concerning his balls and I insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.

Edit/Update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. I tried calling him to apologize since he's ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(

More Edit: I'm very sorry if I gave the wrong impression of him here. Words are very limited. He really is a good guy otherwise. I know and I hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. But I really like him (AND his balls big or small!). I did not mean to hurt him this deeply and I'm just so sad right now that I hurt him this much. I feel like a terrible person. I shouldn't have reacted with cattiness that I didn't even mean because I like his balls just the way they are!

One last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies. Not sure where this will go but I guess I'll see.",tifu
TIFU by buying my mom an Amazon device.,"I want to start by giving some background here. I basically live, eat, sleep and breath Amazon. I need something, straight to Amazon. I use kindle and audible daily. Want to stream music, Amazon music. Want a new movie, prime video. Run out of something randomly, ""Hey Alexa......."" Laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. Amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. So when looking for a place to store photos, I see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with Amazon photos"". Naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. Automatically upload photos from my phone? Even better. 

Rewind to September 25th, my mom's birthday. I thought about her gift for a while, but when I remembered she didn't have a smart TV, the answer was easy. I hop on Amazon shopping and use my Amazon credit card to purchase one FireTV stick. She was so happy she could watch Netflix on her TV now. Yay, success! Or so I thought. 

Yesterday I get an email from Amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the Fire TV family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! Not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did I imagine that it would sign in to my Amazon account without even asking for a password. Surely she'd have to use her own account. 

Fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. Eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. Sitting in my mother's kitchen, I glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

I spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. I happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. I'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. I took probably 40 pictures that night for my SO to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my ENTIRE FAMILY to view. I have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

Nobody helped me. The remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where I'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. I didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, I just ran away. 

The worst part, I asked Alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, I'm not sure about that."" Fuck Amazon.

Update: I promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. I talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. However, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

I'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an Amazon ad, I just wrote it how I wrote it because I thought it was funny. I wish Amazon was paying me for this crap. 

I'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. Yes I fucked up, I was a dumbass, that's why I posted it here. Yes, I should have known this could happen. Call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my SO do. It's fun. I don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. It happened. 

Thanks to everyone for the awards and sharing your similar stories, they made me laugh. And thanks for checking out my cat!!!!!

TLDR my sexy pics ended up on my mom's tv at a family party.",tifu

TIFU by ingesting my bf's chemo,"Figured it out today, but have been fucking up for 3 weeks. 

Bf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. So our sex life has stayed at our normal level. Probably even more active since, well, he's terminal. 

I've been having horrible nausea and headaches. I already have anxiety so I figured I'm just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. 

This morning I woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. I Google, and no that's not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. Symptoms include nausea and headaches. And the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. 

I've been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. 

You're supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. Now that I know this it seems SUPER OBVIOUS. But uh, guess I was too horny to think it through.

TL;DR did dirty deeds with my bf's chemo dick and got sick from it

ETA: Thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. 

To answer as many questions as I can and also because I feel mildly defensive: He is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. There is no cure but no timeline either. We probably have a few more years. He is in EXCELLENT care at a renowned university program. We adore his team. I've been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. This was not reviewed with us, only side effects. The separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. We didnt read the pamphlet because this ain't his first chemo rodeo. But it is mine. So all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. We're only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he'd be too weak for sex. Or they just forgot. Or they figured we'd read the info. Shit happens.

TIFU by missing every sign on a date,"So didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. I invited a close friend to the movies with me. A few odd things happened, and it wasn't until I spoke to a friend of mine that I realized I missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) Beforehand, I jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and I got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). She replies ""Don't worry, if that were you and I, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. I laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) Driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. I replied, ""I guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. She then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in [my car] though"". I then replied ""You know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) When we get back to her house, she asks if I want to go inside to get a soda, to which I politely declined because I wasn't thirsty.

TLDR: I missed strong signs that she was dtf


Edit: There is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again.

"I [25]f urgently called my colleague [28]m about a disaster with our current work after he had left for the day, and now I have to speak to his girlfriend, and also send her photos of all emails between us","My colleague and I have been working on a super important/confidential project this week, I work until 6pm and he works until 3pm. 

At 5pm, I realised 70% of our cases had disappeared. Because of the seriousness of this information, we could be instantly dismissed if it got into the wrong hands. In a panic, I called him (for the first time ever in 6 months, might I add) while scrambling bits of paper and instantly shouted down the phone ""MATE IVE LOST THE CASES"". Luckily, although he sent me on a wild goose chase, he remembered he had put them in his locked cabinet for tomorrow. The phone call was ended with a thanks, the phone call lasted 55 seconds. 

About half an hour later, I was bombarded with phone calls from him. I ran out of the office in a panic and picked up, where he explained that I called him about the cases at a really really bad time. A bit confused, I apologised for calling him out of hours but it was seriously urgent. 

He went onto explain that his girlfriend had since become extremely angry and accused him of having an affair with me. With his voice trembling, he said to me that I needed to speak to his girlfriend on the phone to explain who I am and why I needed to contact him, and also all evidence of emails back and forth for the last six months. I kind of laughed in disbelief and said don't be so ridiculous, then he went completely silent and said ""you have to do this for me. Please."" Instantly I went a bit cold, because I've never heard a mans voice tremble like that. 

I agreed to do whatever would make the situation better for him and asked if he felt like he was in danger. He hesitated, but then said ""I don't know what else to do, she's really kicking off at me. Please don't tell anyone about this"". I suggested to take himself away from the situation if he can and to contact a family member, friend or even the police if it felt necessary. I'm still waiting on contact from his girlfriend, but learning from personal experience of domestic abuse she will not contact me, only emotionally manipulate him into feeling like he did something wrong. 

He is a really relaxed, happy guy at work so to hear him frightened and manic has made me extremely concerned. 

What do I say when she calls? Do I send her every single email for the last six months? Do I try to talk to him tomorrow at work about it? Do I stay away from his personal situation and mind my own business?

TIFU by fixing my In-Law's PC & discovered their into the same kink as my wife.,"So, I work in IT repair. PC, tablets, Mobile phones, that sort of thing. Which means, as anyone in the field can attest, means giving free tech support to family and friends. 

So about 2 weeks ago, I'm at my wife's parent's house, taking a look at their sick desktop in return for having my Father-in-Law service my car. (He's a mechanic)

Anyway, FiL comes back inside for a coffee break, and is asking me questions about how to sell stuff on eBay. I fire up a browser window, head to eBay and log into his account. My eyes immediately lock onto the fact in the ""recently viewed"" items are an assortment of horse riding crops.

My mind logs this as odd, somewhere in the back of my brain, and moves on with the tutorial, my Father-in-Law finishes his coffee and heads back out to my car.

I return to cleaning up his PC and scans, etc find a few things that are tied back to a bunch of BDSM / Fetish porn sites, spanking videos, etc.

Now normally, after a decade of dealing with people's PCs, I have a very ""no judgements"" stance with this sort of stuff. At least the eBay searches for riding crops make sense... 
But my mind chose that moment to remind me that my wife has (somewhat) recently revealed that she's kinda into that sort of thing. We recently had a ""dirty weekend away"", where she revealed that she had recently purchased an assortment of paddles, whips, restraints, and things that vibrate (Thanks Fifty Shades... I guess...?)
*Not complaining - lf it gets her off, I'll try just about anything at least once. *

And now, from that day forward, whenever things have gotten a little... spicy in the bedroom, there's a part of my brain that's thinking ""Do you know that your parents are into this stuff too?"" ü§î

(I'm sure my wife does NOT have any knowledge of this, and to learn of it would mortify her to the point that we'd never have sex again.)

"*UPDATE - Don't want to have a ""Click-Bait"" Title - Wife's Wedding Band(s)","[**\*\*\*Original Post\*\*\***](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b8kigy/cant_wait_until_thursdaymy48m_wife44f_is_going_to/)

So, I have just returned from lunch, where my wife received her new bands.  We kept it low key, no pictures/video, and semi-private.  What we did was planned to take her cut band to a local jeweler after lunch, and invited our two sons to lunch before the ""appointment"".  While ordering, Oldest son asks to see the damaged/cut wedding band, saying he might be able to fix it, he takes it below the table and starts acting like he is squeezing and straining, and then places a complete ""fixed"" band on the table, and asks his mom if that works, she is ASTOUNDED, and places the band on her finger, but....it is too big.  Youngest son says he can fix THAT and asks for the band, wife reluctantly and with a look of ""WTF is going on"" on her face, hands the band to our youngest, he takes it below the table, and squeezes and strains, and makes it ""smaller, but not quite perfect"" when she puts it on.  She is now trying to figure it out, and as she takes it off and starts to inspect it, I take it away from her and do the same ""act"" as our boys, but this time, the band fits PERFECTLY on her finger, and she has quite LITERALLY had enough!  She finally takes it off, and is inspecting it pretty hard, and cannot figure it out.....until My oldest places her cut and older band on the table, our youngest places the too large band on the table, and I place the next size on the table.  At this point she's just staring at all of us, and I explain what had happened, and how I was able to find the jeweler, etc.  I even showed her the Reddit post.  She didn't start crying until reading about the comments and all the caring and support you guys posted.  Lunch was ordered, we all talked about everything, ate lunch as a family, parted ways back to respective work, home, etc.

She (wife) did mention that after reading all the replies, she would have KILLED me if I had gone full public display, and all that, so very thankful to those that suggested to keep it low key and semi-private.

So, about the jeweler.  They responded to my email regarding posting the name/info, and would like to maintain their privacy.  The oldest son IS making jewelry and doing repairs ONLY to catch up previous orders and work requests prior to their fathers passing.  Once it is all caught up, they are closing it for good.  They sent copies of the drawings and mold for our bands and we placed them in our safe at home in case this happens again, we can get something made/designed.  I followed up asking if there was ANY way to repay their kindness, and haven't had a response.  Regardless, my wife is planning on hitting up some local spots and making them a ""Texan"" Gift Package and sending it to them.

And that's it.  She is extremely happy and overjoyed.  I am really glad it's ""over"" as I had NO idea this would garner this much attention, and can now go back to our normal lives.  Thanks to everyone for their suggestions, and we are grateful to all the outpouring of genuine caring, thank you to everyone that sent Silver, Gold, and Platinum, it wasn't necessary but greatly appreciated.

***Edit - I keep reading comments about the Jewelers, and this being fake.  The Daughter, Son, and an Uncle are all working part time to finish work that was commissioned prior to their fathers passing.  From what was explained to me, none of them were, are, or plan to be in the jewelry business.  So, take that however you want, I have tried to be as genuine as possible, and have ZERO reason to be dishonest.  I really do feel sorry for the cynical way some people live life.  Follow the old adage ""If you can't say something nice.....""

TL;DR - Took wife and sons to lunch, pretended to try and fix her band, sons helped in the scenario, wife was finally presented all three bands that were sent, and told about what had occurred.",relationship_advice

WIBTA if I reported this woman?,"I was on a call with my sister, who was giving me some usual gossip about people we know from back home, when she tells me about a family friend Dina who has just recently become sexually active with her boyfriend. I asked my sister how she knew Dina was sexually active, and she told me she heard it from my mom. 

I know that Dina is super private and comes from a really conservative household, and wouldn't dare tell her parents about her being sexually active. I asked my sister how my mom knew, and apparently my mom's best friend, let's call her Miss Annie (not Dina's mother) is very good friends with Dina's PCP, who told her the gossip. I work in healthcare, and I feel like this HAS to be a HIPAA violation, so I told my sister I might have to report Dina's PCP. 

WIBTA if I report her? My sister told me I shouldn't because ""you'll be ruining that doctor's life and her family over 'just a bit of gossip'"" (she has two small children and is in the process of moving her husband over to the US from abroad) and that I should just ""mind my own business."" My best friend (who also knows Dina well) said that I don't have any proof to report her over just ""hearsay"" and ""gossip."" However this situation isn't sitting right with me.

EDIT: Hey guys! So after heavy consideration, I scheduled a three way call between my sister, Dina and I to talk about this. I'll keep you all updated! Thanks for all your input everyone :)

EDIT 2: Hi guys! Sorry for the lack of update (mods turned me down) Just wanted to update you all - turns out that Dina did tell her doctor about it.... in confidence at a family friend's party where Miss Annie happened to be eavesdropping on. Long story short, Dina's mom had an angry conversation with Miss Annie and told her essentially to ""get a life"" and to ""stop gossiping about other people's children."" I'm happy I told Dina first and didn't report that doctor. Thanks guys!",AmItheAsshole

"AITA for not telling my sister about my nephew's new ""boyfriend""?","Last year I took in my nephew, who is now almost 17, after my sister and her husband kicked him out because of his sexuality. I'm a single parent of two kids of my own, 15 year old girl and 12 year old boy, and we live in another state so it was a big transition for everyone but I felt it was important. I should also note that I left the church of latter day saints (Mormon) 8 years ago and moved out of Utah. It's part of the reason I am divorced. 

Anyway, last night I took the kids out to a local carnival and my nephew ran into his ""boyfriend"" there. I put boyfriend in quotes because they aren't really dating. In my family they would refer to it as ""crushing on each other"" instead. The ""boyfriend"" joined our group and my nephew took a picture of him with my two kids and posted it on social media saying ""Nothing better than hanging out with the people I love."" I thought it was innocent enough. He never said they were dating and you can love your friends, but another one of my nieces saw it and reported it to my nephew's mom (my sister).

My sister is furious. She said that she should have been notified that he was dating. When I told her that they aren't even dating she said that she should have been told they were interested in each other. Here's the thing though. There is no expectation that kids need to tell their parents who they are crushing on and my sister never felt the need to know when she thought her son was straight. Now that she knows he's gay I don't think the rules should change to where she has to know if he has a crush on his friends. 

I also told her that she doesn't really have a say anymore. I have legal guardianship over my nephew. He's living in my home. She kicked him out. She started crying after I said this and told my family so I've been answering phone calls all morning hearing about how awful of a person I am for saying that to my sister. I don't see it but maybe I'm wrong. Should I have told her even though they aren't serious? Was it a low blow to say the things I said to her? Am I the asshole?

Edit: Thanks everyone. I feel like an asshole now for asking this question. It probably seems obvious to many people but this is all brand new to me. Walking away from the church and my ex husband was the hardest thing I ever had to do and I think I still carry a lot of guilt from that. My kids don't get to see a lot of my family or their dad's family because we aren't welcome for walking away. To have my whole family pissed at me again really hurt. I don't know anything about raising a 17 year old in general and am only now getting caught up on what it means to have a gay child so it's a learning process.

Edit2: I completely understand why people think this is a validation post and don't blame the mods if they have to delete this. I want to be super clear that wasn't what I intended to do. When you grow up in the environment I did it's hard to feel confident in any decision you make. Everything I did from the time I started talking to leaving my husband and the church has been questioned. Going against my family automatically makes me feel like I am messing up. When I picked a college they didn't want me to go to and refused to acknowledge or pay for, my first thought was that I messed up. When I divorced my husband and left Utah and my family stopped speaking to me, I thought I messed up. It has taken years to overcome what I have been taught and I am not a confident person. I let my 12 year old join the football team this year and can't stop questioning that. Every decision I make is harder for me than it is for most people. I am sorry if anyone feels like I am being anything other than genuine.",AmItheAsshole

I (24F) met my new flatmate (26M) yesterday and we had sex within an hour of meeting. Don't know what to do,"Hi. Please don't judge me!

I'm not the kind of girl that usually does this. I've only slept with 5 people, all relationships. I've never even had a one night stand.

(EDIT: Fuck what I said above, judge me all you like, and yes I am that kind of girl now watcha gone do) 

I live in a 4 bed house, and we had a room spare. Yesterday the new flatmate moved in. I wasn't in when he arrived but when I got back from work, he was in the kitchen making food. The second that I walked in, I don't know how or why or what happened but the sexual tension was just ridiculous. Even just from seeing the back of his head I felt something weird.

We spoke for a few minutes, introduced ourselves etc. But it felt like we were really comfortable with each other already and we were getting along so well. There's no point me going into all the details I am literally just blown away by what happened and I guess typing it is helping me come to terms with it. There's so much sexual tension between us that I want to brag about it haha.

So we started talking about a new tv series and I invited him to watch it in my room, as I'd just put on the next episode. He accepted, and soon were stoned in bed watching tv and then we just made eye contact at like an awkward sex scene and then suddenly we're kissing.

It was crazy, I wasn't even thinking, I wasn't making sense of anything around me, I just wanted to have sex with him. He's sooo ridiculously like my type but extra somehow. I wish I could explain it. Literally if anyone can tell me what sexual tension is scientifically, ELI5, pleaseeee.

Anyway, we had sex for maybe half an hour and then we heard another flatmate come home and my mum called me, so he just went to his room. I saw him a couple hours later going to the bathroom and he just winked at me and said 'can't believe we just did that' and I just said 'yeah crazy...' 

Wtf do I do now

I fancy him so much

The sex was great

But he's my flatmate and it's all awkward and weird 

And I stalked his Instagram and he doesn't upload regularly but it looks like he had a girlfriend pretty recently. I can only assume (well pray) that they are in fact broken up.

Lord how do I survive in this house, is it safe to keep having sex with him? Because I want to... can I just knock on his door and ask if he wants to do it again?


Edit: some of these comments are insane haha. I don't feel bad about it. Do I normally do that kind of thing? No. Am I that kind of girl now? Yeah I guess I am, who cares. You can judge me if you want to :)

Edit 2: I used protection. I'm aware that he may not want to do it again and that we may not be soulmates. That is a-okay, there's no pressure on him. He can do what he wants and so can I. Maybe he does have a girlfriend; I'm not responsible for that, I didn't cheat on anyone, and if I find out he does have a girlfriend, I'll tell her. This event does not define me as a person or make me less of a person. Grow up it's 2019 and people be shaggin",relationship_advice
My husbands dentist LIED saying he had 13 cavities when MY dentist said his teeth are perfect!,"Thank you in advance for any advice or information given to help!

My husband (27m) had a different dentist from the one I (26f) had been using since I was a kid. There was a period of time he didn't go to the dentist for a couple of years. So about 4 years ago he went back to the same dentist he used to use, and his mother has always used. 
That dentist in NJ told my husband he had 13 cavities! So my husband listened and went back to start having them filled. He ""filled"" at least two then my husband stopped going again. 

Fast forward to now, I went to see my dentist on Tuesday and made appointment for my husband to go in today (Thursday).  MY dentist showed my husband his X-rays and told him his teeth are perfect! And that he actually had pre drill holes where this other dentist was going to fill fake cavities!! This is so wrong! My MIL also had thousands of dollars of work done to her mouth that could also have been unnecessary. She is making an appointment with my dentist to get another opinion on her mouth.

Last week my daughter graduated HS.  We packed up her room (the essentials) from her Mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her College dorm.  A few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend Tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  I was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. It was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. We stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  The next day we went to Tony's and she got a small 2"" x 4"" tattoo above her ankle.  I've known Tony since High School, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  I completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  He even did MY first tattoo when WE were in High School.  The entire experience was actually a blast for me.  I haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  To see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  

&#x200B;

Of course the next day she posts pics online, and her Mom flips her shit.  She calls me screaming about how irresponsible I am.  I honestly didn't know her Mom wouldn't be OK with it.  She has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about Daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and I'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  She's also cut me out of multiple milestones in Daughter's life.  Graduations, performances, games, etc.  Until Daughter was old enough to tell me directly, I was never invited so I missed a lot of moments.  

&#x200B;

Obviously Daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me ""I'm getting a tattoo"" instead of asking me.  I definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  Wife has been OK with her having sex since 13, picked her own High School and College, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  Why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  Would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?  

&#x200B;

Mom is livid.  She threatened to call the police.  Threatened to pick up Daughter and bring her back to her house.  Tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  None of this is happening.  A culture was created in which I don't get input on things regarding Daughter.  A culture was created in which Mom allowed Daughter to make decisions for herself.  AITA here for not double checking with Mom that a tattoo is OK?",AmItheAsshole
TIFU by posting for three years and just now realizing I've been shadow banned this entire time.,"It never really made sense why over the course of three years I never got one comment or upvote/downvote for all of my posts. Reddit is an absolutely huge site, but after a couple years you begin to have your doubts. I decided to check to see if I could see my posts in an incognito browser and saw that none of my posts existed. What the fuck?! It was at that moment I realized that from my first post I was shadow banned and all of my contributions over three years never was viewed by a soul. I can't fucking believe I never caught onto it sooner. I've had my hand raised for three years and no one could ever see me and I never questioned it.

TIFU by destroying my brother's smart home,"This actually happened a week ago but I just found out about it today.

My brother rents a studio in NYC but he's been out of town for work. I went up to visit some friends and he said it'd be fine if I stayed at his place. When I got there the wall lights worked but for some reason none of the floor lamps did. There were 5 different floor lamps and none of them would turn on. There was also recently a power outage that affected the same area his studio is in so being the bright man that I am I figured that the power coming back must have fried the bulbs. Being a good brother I went out and bought brand new bulbs and threw out the broken ones. 

Today my brother got back and gave me a call asking if I replaced his light bulbs. I told him I did and not to worry about it but his old ones were broken so I replaced them. Turns out they weren't broken, they were just smart bulbs linked to his smart speaker. They were $60 a piece so I effectively threw out $300 of smart bulbs.

TL;DR Brightest bulb in the closet threw out hundreds of dollars in smart bulbs",tifu

(UPDATE) Brother (15m) made fake instagram of me (25m) to make JW parents think I'm not gay.,"Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/cjkflc/my\_brother\_15m\_has\_been\_lying\_about\_my\_25m\_life/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cjkflc/my_brother_15m_has_been_lying_about_my_25m_life/) 

Thank you all for your illuminating comments. I'm honestly overwhelmed at the response & apologize for not replying much, it was so much. But I'd like to specifically thank [u/\_\_my\_man\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) for his comment, which suggested that this was not him trying to rope me back in, but him trying to escape the cult. You were exactly right.

Today we talked for the first time since our conversation. He took down the insta after our conversation (which I hadn't noticed at the time of writing the post, haha), and I gently asked why, exactly, he did this. He's fifteen, so he didn't quite have the language to say ""I'm being abused and need to leave the JW."" What he said, instead, was that mom and dad are ""crazy"" and he's become disillusioned with the cult (he even used the word ""cult""). He still believes in God and wants to explore different sects of Judeo-Christianity. My hometown is a small place in the midwest, and everyone knows who the JW are...they're, like, ""those people"". So he couldn't covertly go to another service without someone recognizing him and it getting back to my parents.

His motive was pretty much what [u/\_\_my\_man\_\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/__my_man__/) said. He said he wants to visit, hang out, and explore the religions around Chicago, but the only way my parents would allow him to leave town is if they knew EXACTLY where he was, who he was with the whole time, etc. So in his head, propping me up as converted was the only way to make it happen. I told him I was completely uncomfortable with that, and that my relationship with my parents is over. He apologized, and pretty much already knew the logistical problems. I think this was a very maturing ordeal for him.

I established myself as a lifeline. I told him that if it ever gets too much, I will pay for his train ticket and he can stay with me for as long as he likes, even moving in for the remainder of high school. (And I mean it: I have enough space, and my aunt will help with childcare/extra expenses). He seemed apprehensive, but the thought's out there, and he now seems comfortable enough to vent about the church/my parents/my crazy ass sister directly. 

As for my parents, I just told him to cold turkey stop talking about me. If they ask (and this was suggested by Julie, my ""bride-to-be""), he will tell them that I might have refound Christianity but I have no intentions to return to the Watch Tower, and that he stopped talking to me. Leaving JW for any reason is grounds for excommunication. And I put my actual insta on private, in case they go looking. They might think I'm not gay, might now have the sliver of hope that I'll return to them, but that's honestly not my fucking problem. 

And for the guys who suggested this was a honeypot...no. No fifteen year old can act this well. He's so, so full of love and kindness, and as fucked up as his plan was, it was at the end of the day because he is panicking in a toxic enviorment. 

Thank you all, again. My brother is back in my life, and I now have the means to help him. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

**TL;DR: My brother made the fake insta so he could have an excuse to visit me. I told him if he ever wants to escape my parents, I will be here for him to move in with. The insta is deleted. Thank you.**",relationship_advice
TIFU: by thinking my daughter was being raped and sending her bf to the hospital [NSFW],"I'm still trying to process what just happened. Today was my daughters 19th birthday and I wanted to surprise her by coming home early with a cake. I brought the cake home, slowly tip-toed to her room to surprise her and heard something I will never unhear. She was having sex with her boyfriend and saying ""please stop it hurts, stop it."" I ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. I was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. I threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. My daughter was frantically explaining to me that it's a fetish and he wasn't actually hurting her. I told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and I rushed him to the hospital. He's doing okay now and isn't suffering any major injuries but I feel awful. I'm not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and I truly thought he was hurting her.

TLDR; mistook my daughters fetish for her bf hurting her and knocked him unconscious

AITA for 100% refusing to let my dad/mom see my child for something done 10-15 years ago? /Petty,"OK so this is kinda complex, I'll make it short.  This acc is just for privacy reasons

-I always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. I never had problems with my parents before this. 

-I went to med school, still living with parents when I was 20, I dated someone who was 23

-Dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says I cannot date J. 

-Argument breaks out, Dad says it's his house so either I agree or I move out. I say it's not fair as J has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. Dad kicks me out. Mom agrees with his decision. Little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-I moved with J, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (I went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-Years later, me and J (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (Like really small but I'm happy with it). I ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. I let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  He came a few times. 

-Today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when I was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. I said never and that I wasn't going to forgive them. Bro says I'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, I say that's bullshit because Dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. Bro says I should at least let Mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. I say Mom was able to do something but didn't,but that Bro's situation was different because he was only 15. Bro is upset because he says Mom and Dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that I am dragging this entire situation. I told him that if he thinks I'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. He's angry and says that I need to move on and that I shouldn't be withholding them from seeing THEIR grandchild. I say that THEY disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

AITA? I don't hate my bro and I (kinda)  get what he is saying, but I just have a resentment for my parents. It's not like I had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks I'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty.

A 15 year old girl made false allegations to CPS about my 8 yo son because she doesn't like my 15 yo daughter.,"My daughter was close friends with a girl for a few years and they had a falling out over ridiculous things. I don't want to go into too many details because the reasons are very specific and the family would immediately know I was talking about them. 

The girl's mother is crazy and she likes to threaten people with legal action and throw her job title around (she does not work in law or any real position of power... She just has delusions of grandeur). The mother also believes her daughter is perfect and everyone is jealous and bullying her daughter because of their jealousy. 

I will refer to the mother as Lorrie and the daughter as Katy so the rest of this is less confusing. 

Lorrie has been to the school multiple times and accused my daughter and other students of bullying Katy. The assistant principal has pulled my daughter out of class to discuss Katy. I'm not sure if Lorrie had anything to do with the CPS report but I can not contact her directly. Lorrie refused to communicate with me when the girls first stopped being friends. I tried to contact her several times and she does not answer my calls and has been outwardly hostile to my daughter on more than one occasion.

Katy is a bully who says hurtful and dark natured stuff to try and appear ""edgy"" to her friends. My daughter has told me some pretty horrific stuff that Katy said and I advised my daughter to stay cautious throughout their friendship. When the friendship fell apart, Katy began to say pretty cruel things about my daughter, my son, and our home. My daughter would tell me about the worst of it. 

One of the things Katy said about my 8 year old son was disgusting and completely out of line so my husband and I remembered it pretty vividly. My daughter told us about the comment about 3 or 4 months ago. 

A few days ago, CPS knocked on our door while I was at work and told my husband that someone made a report to them about my son and the complaint was exactly what Katy was saying about him at school a few months ago. There is no one else who could have made this complaint. It was very specific and had no affiliation with anything based in reality. My husband said the CPS employee was very nice and they seemed like they knew that the report was ridiculous. I wasn't there so I don't know what the tone of the conversation was like. 

The problem is I have no proof. The assistant principal at my daughter and Katy's high school is planning to interview some of the students that were around Katy when she made these comments about my son so I might have some backup which is great, but it's still just hearsay and there is no tangible evidence like text messages or recordings of her saying these things about my son. 

What should I do? Is there anything I can do? Do I even have a leg to stand on? All I have is my word, my daughter's word and the possible words of a few 15 year old kids. 

Any advice is welcome. I'm terrified.

I am in VA.

Edit: I'm not looking to sue anyone or anything. I just want to clear all of this up and I want Katy to be held accountable for making a false report. The things she reported could potentially hurt my son's reputation and damage his future. The allegations were not about me or my husband being neglectful or abusive. They were accusing my son of doing horrible things that he did not and would never do.",legaladvice

&#x200B;

tldr Asked an old friend to stop being so handsy with my boyfriend, she took it the wrong way and told a common friend I got no business telling her what to do since I owe her so much

&#x200B;

My boyfriend is having sex with her.

A friend convinced some other friends to send me prints of texts between themselves and either my BF or ""best friend"".

They are pretty clear.

I confronted my BF, he looked lost, said he loves me and it was just sex. He says ""Jessie""kept throwing herself at him, teasing him, and he said he didn't like her but I still wanted to hang.

He said he just had sex with her to see if she would move on and leave him alone, and that it only happened a couple of times. Says he wont do it anymore, he doesn't even like her, he loves me, asking me to please forgive him.

From the texts, once I finally made it through them all, I think that Jessie went to the party (where me and BF met) cause she wanted to hook up with him. She had it bad for him, but he didn't feel the same way. She was trying to get him to break up with me, and then to get me to break up with him.

It worked. As of yesterday he is a single man.

In some of those texts, they are talking about some of the hook ups. I feel like throwing up.

I blocked him, cause he was still trying to get in touch.

I ghosted her. But she just sent me a message saying she just heard what happened and ""you know this was probably for the best right?"" and I feel like fucking screaming.

I don't know if this is an update or just me venting.

Thanks for listening either way.

EDIT

I don't wanna sound melodramatic or sappy or anything, but you all brought me to tears.

We keep hearing about how it is insanity to rely on the internet for personal connections, but I just lost a boyfriend, a best friend, and a whole group of friends.. and instead of feeling alone, I am more and more feeling like ""fuck yeah that was the right thing to do, I will be ok"".  It still hurts. But not as much as it would had I really been alone.

I can't even begin to thank this sub.

I really don't know what to say.

Even on my previous posts that didn't get as many responses, it was some of the comments there that made me approach the cheating thing knowing I had to break up and move on. So it changed my life in this moment. And considering I will be doing a lot of soul searching on toxic relationships, this probably changed my life for good.

So thank you all so much for reaching out to a stranger. This community is so precious!

And I got a gold, I don't even know what to say! Thank you so much! I don't mean to sound ungrateful, but I don't even know how much a gold costs, and this is an alt account, so it wont really be used. Is there any way I can return it to the sender? 

Some of you are asking for an update. I might in a while, if there is something new to tell. Right now it's just more of the same.

I don't think I will be able to answer all the comments, but I am trying to at least answer the ones with questions!

TIFU by swallowing my little sister's birthday present,"I am so beside myself with shame that I almost couldn't bring myself to post this. 

But reddit karma is my mistress and I must heed her sweet call. 

So yesterday was my sister's birthday (this fu didn't happen today, yadda yadda), I was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. 

""Look what mom gave me,"" said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.

Now, I cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. I looked at that ring in my hand and I just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. My primitive ape brain said ""funny joke!""

So I did it.

I think it was the next split second when I saw the horror in my sister's eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that I realized what a horrible mistake I had made. 

So my little sister runs screaming from my room and I hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as I admitted that I, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister's ring. No, I didn't know why I did it. Yes, I am an idiot. No one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.

So brief intermission from my sister's birthday as I make a quick excursion to the ER, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them I was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. They took a couple X-rays and I hung around the ER for about 8 hours before they broke the news that I was going to live (much to my mother's chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. 

I shat out the ring this morning. 

Happy birthday sis. 

TL;DR: I am an idiot and I ate my sister's ring because I thought it would be funny.

AITA for excluding one of my girlfriends from girls' night out after he came out as transgender?,"  First off it's not my intent to misgender but this is new to me so excuse me. One of my friends recently came out as trans and said she always felt like a guy trapped inside a woman's body.



  She has started transitioning & wearing male clothing and wants us to start referring to her using male pronouns instead of female. I have no problem with him being transgender however my other girlfriends and I don't feel comfortable including him in our night outs once he's done transitioning.



   We don't feel it's appropriate anymore because it's, well, girls' night out. I mentioned this to my bf and he says it's transphobic to exclude him but we don't feel comfortable with him anymore and I think our feelings overtake his. Plus in my defense if excluding him is transphobic then girls' night outs are sexist because they exclude men. I don't think we're doing anything wrong because my safety overtakes his feelings.

"Boyfriends ankle monitor is dying, his charger isn't working and no one from the house arrest company will pick up. What should we do??","Trying to get this update out there proved to be harder than I thought. So I put my update here. 

OP is still published at the bottom of this post

I know a lot of people were concerned about the reason behind my boyfriends house arrest sentence. Which led to an entire post on r/bestoflegaladvice being dedicated to how gullible, stupid and naive I must be for believing his reasoning. Whelp! He got off house arrest on Tuesday (9/10) ((yay!! :)), I asked if he would mind if I uploaded his ""certificate of completion"" to reddit and he said that was fine.

[Certificate of Completion ](https://imgur.com/a/BY974wg)

A few people asked some really good questions so I'm going to try to be as clear as possible:

He really was not on probation or parole. When he went to trial he was given the option to ""complete the program,"" which was a year with a PRIVATELY OWNED house arrest company. If he failed to complete the program he would be sentenced to three years in prison.

The terms of his house arrest, as per the company's rules, where that he was allowed one grocery store trip a week and needed to provide sign-in and sign-out sheets for his daily work shifts. He could not leave the house otherwise unless explicitly approved by the owner of the company. Every other week he was required to ""check in,"" which means he had to go into the house arrest place, sit down with someone, and provide receipts for his trips to the store as well as all of his work slips to prove that he was at the locations doing what he was supposed to be doing. He had to pay the company $60/week to be on house arrest with them (which was quite an expense but definitely better than prison). 

Now that he has completed the program, he hands over his certificate to a judge to show that he served his time and he is now eligible to reapply for a drivers license (which was obviously revoked when he was ""sentenced"" due to DUS charges).

He was never on parole. He was never on probation. This entire ordeal was due to being a ""habitual traffic offender."" A year of house arrest. For driving without insurance. He could not afford the insurance and was driving to get to work, to afford the insurance, he even switched up cars every time he drove. Does ANY of that make what he did okay? Absolutely not. But I did want to provide proof for those who were concerned that that is why he was put on house arrest and for no other reason.

TL;DR: My boyfriend was sentenced to a year on house arrest due to traffic violations, no other reason. He has completed the program and now we're going to the beach.

Thank you for coming to my TEDtalk I hope this cleared things up. Sorry for the lengthy post.

OP:

Title explains it all. What is our best course of action to prevent him from going to prison if his monitor dies before they open in the morning? I suggested maybe filming himself sitting at home for proof he didn't go anywhere. He thinks maybe he should call the police and go into the station so that he can be supervised, maybe put in a holding cell overnight so that he has witnesses that he didn't go anywhere. 

Time is a factor. What do we do??

Edit: thanks everyone for your feedback. He called, left a voicemail, sent a text, sent a video recording of the monitor and charger not working (he has been on house arrest for 11.5 months we definitely know what it looks like when it's supposed to be charging)((he gets off sep. 14! :)), his supervisor has an iPhone so we even shared his location with them. Everything we could think of.


At 12:29am we got this text back:
""Sorry so late.. I have been traveling today and not near a computer or cell coverage. I looked it up and it should have showed you on charge but hasn't. Either it's not connected or charger not working. Still showing low battery. Call the office at 9 and talk to greg about it. I'm sorry.""

Crisis averted. Sounds like we'll just stay put until the office opens and then we'll go in to get everything checked, and we'll be sharing his iPhone location with them until then.

I would like to take a moment to address a few frequently asked questions:
1. We are in South Carolina.
2. He is not on probation or parole. He has never in his life been convicted of a crime. He was actually put on house arrest because he acquired too many traffic violations (none of which were DUIs, which in my opinion is absolutely ridiculous).
3. The house arrest company is a privately owned business. There is a man and wife who charge every person they keep on house arrest $60/WEEK. Capitalism ladies and gentlemen.

Thanks again for everything and if anything changes I'll let y'all know.

Final edit: we went in to the house arrest place today after they opened, they gave him a new monitor, a new charger, a back up charger still in the box, and even knocked 4 days off his sentence!!! Horribly, horribly stressful event had a relatively happy ending. Thank you everyone who took the time to read and reply.

EDITEDIT: people are getting pretty mean, this got way out of hand. I want to genuinely thank everyone who responded to this post with helpful information when we were in need of advice, and our issue has resolved since then. I may make a separate post with all of the interesting information and developments that came about as a result of this once I get some more organized/tangible information, but honestly it's late and hate mail takes a lot out of you. Thanks again to everyone who was sincere and wanted to help.


Absolutely, positively, nonnegotiable final edit: Okay kids, it's been a long day. We laughed, we cried, we learned a lot about ourselves. But at the end of the day, after grilling him, background searching him, and even calling his mom, it has become abundantly and unquestionably clear that my bf's current house arrest sentence is 100% due to three DUS (driving under suspension) arrests. He was pulled over driving without insurance, three times. Irresponsible? Oh absolutely, he's known from the beginning how I feel about it. But, he is not, nor has he ever been, 1)in prison 2)on parole or 3)on probation. The disconnect was the difference between arrested and convicted, that is where I was confused and as a result confused some of y'all. He had been arrested several times when he was in his teens (a very, very long time ago) and all of them were for dumb teen stuff like petty shoplifting, which he never went to prison for. Was that stuff irresponsible? Yes. Illegal?? Also yes. But a long long time ago and entirely unrelated to his current house arrest sentence? You betcha. We had a good laugh about how dumb he was as a teen, he remembered a lot and I learned a lot. To everyone saying I'm dumb for believing him about his current situation: you had me really questioning things for a minute there and I'm sorry to disappoint you but that's all there is to it. He will be getting off house arrest on September 10th, and to celebrate we're going to the beach. The end.",legaladvice
"Calling self harm ""battle scars"" is shitty and stupid","Ive never heard anyone ever call someone out on this, but calling your self harm your ""battle scars"" is an entirely retarded thing to say. Its pure romanticization, and to me its the same as saying shit like ""suicidal people are just angels that want to go home"" fuck off and call it by what it is. Its not battle scars, its just self harm and its as simple as that. To do anything otherwise is a complete disservice to people that self harm, theyre not fucking cute, theyre not to be romanticized, theyre ugly and shitty and arent a result of anything remotely close to beautiful. It might be purely because of connotation at this point, but i do feel like usually the people calling it that are the dramatic idiots that make mountains out of molehills and theres a reason why even though i cant properly verbalize it. 

Edit: first off, im a girl, not that it matters. Secondly, a lot of people seem to be getting the impression that id actually chew someone out for calling their OWN self harm battle scars. Id never do that i only get annoyed by this enough to bitch and moan about it on the internet 

Edit 2: I've pretty much changed my mind and this post is dumb and I should definitely be more compassionate lol. I already went into it in some comments and I don't feel like doing it again but don't expect a certain response from me since my opinion isn't the same

Edit 3: people keep (rightfully) criticizing this post and then saying that it's not an unpopular opinion smh",unpopularopinion
