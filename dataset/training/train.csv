"i thought i was paranoid, but i got phished. read my shameful account of said phishing so they don't get you too.. i have different passwords for every website i log into, 2-factor authentication when possible; i thought i knew all the scams and could spot them a mile away. this one still got me. 

i was meeting a friend at a bar. two drinks in i got a call from someone identified by my phone as wells fargo. i'm fully aware this could be spoofed, but it did not raise alarm bells yet. i was at a bar i did not frequent and have gotten calls from my bank before on suspicious charges that were legit, so i answered expecting this to be the case.

the person i spoke with said they were with wells fargo and they've identified fraudulent charges on my account but they need to verify my identity before they can discuss details. they said they sent me a text message (via the cell number they just called, which is my first clue this is phishing). they asked me to read back to them the 6-digit number just texted to me to verify my id. being two drinks in, slightly expecting what this was about, i had zero alarm bells going off. my bad, this was stupid of me. i read the number to them. they suggested it timed out and i needed to read another number they texted to me. minimal time had passed, a mild spidy sense was tingling, but i still was not concerned enough to ask questions and read them a second 6-digit code.

this person then read off 5 recent charges on my account, 4 of which i recognized as legit and a 5th that was a $1000 charge to a credit card i did not own. i immediately identified this as a fraudulent charge and they said ""no prob dude, we'll freeze your card and send you a new one"". they even gave me the last 4 on the card it was coming from. i was appeased enough to continue (sadly). 

finally, they said they sent me one final 6-digit code to confirm that they were crediting my account back with the $1000 fraudulent charge. i just needed to read off the final code they texted to me. at this point things seem weird to me but they got me at a good time. i was 2 drinks in, was interrupted from hanging with a close friend i hadn't seen in months and was outside trying desperately to avoid the loud noise inside the bar but still dealing with traffic noise outside. i just wanted to be done with this. i read them the final code and they thanked me and hung up. 

at this point, i see why my phone had been vibrating constantly through this call. i had 4 emails from wells fargo. 1) your user name has been reset, 2) your password has been reset, 3) welcome to zelle! an awesome $$$ forwarding service, 4) you've just forwarded $1000!!!!!

i called wells fargo via the number on the back of my card. after being on hold for 45 min trying to get the fraud department, i start to tell my story only to have the call drop (i'm pretty sure they hung up on me). i called back and was on hold for 1 hour 20 min (my account has been compromised >2 hours by this time) to get a second person. he told me this was a scam they've been dealing with for 3 months and i needed to go into a branch with 2 forms of id to deal with it. there was nothing he could do tonight.

tdlr: dude spoofed wells fargo when calling me on my cell, requested a reset of my user name, password and approval for $1000 transfer. i stupidly read off the confirmation numbers i received via text to him, he entered them into wells fargo website to approve all these requests. wells fargo has known their customers have been getting scammed for 3 months and didn't bother to warn anyone. i now have to go into a branch, hang my head and tell my shameful story to a person and beg for access to my account because someone else has control of it all night tonight.",10
"i'm putting my extremely profoundly disabled 7 year old into a residential facility so i can forget he exists. i'm not sorry.. i can't tell anyone this, even my therapist. lambast me if you wanr and maybe i even deserve it. i only ask what you would do if you were in my situation. not what you think ""people should"" do. what you would really do. 

i'm a single mom of 2 boys. 12 and 7. my husband passed away 3 years ago in a work accident. a very large portion of me believe it was a suicide. i can't see him ever making the mistake he made that caused his death, and he had taken an action just before that which ensured his co-workers weren't in the room. i fully believe he killed himself because of our younger son and no one will ever change my mind. 

we were told when i was pregnant that he would have downs syndrome. we could handle that. even if it was severe. it turned out he has a chromosome deletion. his disorder is kind of rare so i won't post which specific one but suffice to say he'll never be anything more than he is now or has ever been. 

and what he is, is nothing. 

he doesn't appear to have any awareness and never has. his eyes are locked in one position, he doesn't respond to noise, touch, or pain. he is total care. he is capable of nothing. he is tube fed and on oxygen. he is in diapers and will be forever. he makes no sounds, no attempts to communicate. he never even really cried as a baby.

he has never made an attempt to interact with anyone or his environment. 

i'm not upset because i got a special needs/""imperfect"" child. i feel the way i feel because this...... thing..... takes up 200% of my time and does nothing. i didn't get an imperfect child. i didn't get *a child*. 

i don't love him. he doesn't have any personality, there is nothing to love. and yet i'm responsible for him. in addition to his extreme delays he's also medically fragile. respiratory crises, fecal impactions (his autonomic nervous system doesn't function properly), issues with his g tube, infections, pressure sores no matter what we put him on or how we position him. 

our older son has suffered because his non existent brother has colored everything in his life. he's had medical care get delayed because there's only one of me and hos brother is more critical. we do have a visiting home nurse but only 20 hrs/week and we aren't eligible for more. i was starting law school, i gave up my dreams and my plan for my children for this potato. my older son can't do a lot of things he wants to do because of the youngers need for care and appointments. 

the final straw was i heard a sound. i went into younger son's room to check, thinking he had forgotten how to breathe again, and saw older son hitting him and screaming ""you're why i don't have a mother! you're why i don't have a father! you're why i can't have friends over! you're why i can't be in sports! i didn't ask for you and i hope you die!"" 

instead of being horrified, i watched. and younger son just did. not. react. no signs of pain or fear or upset. no reaction at all. 

he breathes but he is not alive. he doesn't know who i am. he doesn't know who older son is. he has no sense of self, life experience, or awareness of his surroundings. 

he doesn't need to be in my home. he doesn't know or care where he is. he is genetically my son but he is not family. my previously abused, brain damaged cat who can't walk straight has more personality and is far more loveable than my ""child"". in fact i was looking forward to raising a downs baby. even one with severe impairments, for that reason. with disability can come gifts. this boy is not a gift. he is a genetic mistake i probably should have miscarried and would have definitely terminated if i'd known he would be like this. and the flip side is, if he has awareness..... he's miserable. and there is nothing i can do. if he has likes and dislikes no one knows what they are. if he is in pain he can't tell anyone. if he wants anything, he can't communicate. he's had every imaginable therapy, nothing has made a difference. 

and so he's leaving our home on the 29th. i feel excited and relieved and then guilty because i know we'll be happier with him gone. 

he's already taken my husband and my son's father. he was working so so so much ot to pay for the cucumber's care. for the experimental therapies insurance wouldn't cover. because this one was going to be the breakthrough. he was tired and defeated and disappointed. he sought counseling as well but i don't think he could ever say the words ""i don't want my son in my home"" either. 

he's ruined my older son. i was so wrapped up on the younger i never realized how ignored and damaged he was. he lost his father too. i didn't just lose my husband. he is my priority now and this malignant lump can be someone else's problem. at least they'll be paid a wage to care for him. at least they'll get a break from him when they punch out. 

i just want to never think of him again and i'm not sorry. and for that, i'm sorry. 

thanks for reading.

edit: thanks /u/piconeeks, for calling me a liar. are you a medical doctor? if your google fu was any good you would have stumbled on 3p mosaic deletion-duplication syndrome. that is the disorder my son has. i've basically identified myself by posting that but hey, it's better than the pms telling me to kill myself. if you look at the features of 3p deletion syndromes *they look like downs*. my insurance didn't cover afp testing which would have told us it wasn't downs and i didn't think we needed it. i had a regular ultrasound and a 3d. both drs were ""99% sure it was downs"". 

this post was absolutely not fiction. instead the mods and especially /u/piconeeks just ""decided"" it was. 

if anyone would like i'll doxx myself. you can see my id to verify my name, my marriage license, and my husband's death certificate. i will then link you to the news article of the ""freak industrial accident"" that ended his life so you can see it's the same person. 

as for not choosing hospice for my son - i can't. about a year ago i myself was hospitalized with severe depression and c-ptsd (there is proof of that too). during that time my late husbands mother petitioned to get control as my son's medical proxy and got it. i'm fighting it but it's a long, complicated process. there are competency hearings. there are statements from doctors and evaluations. unless she oks hospice, which she refuses, i cannot decide that. i have custody. i cannot ake medical decisions. she agreed to residential care which i feel is the second best option. so, he's going into residential care. 

as for ""mistaking"" a child choking with hitting, i was downstairs. i couldn't hear what my older son was saying. i only knew he was speaking. go punch a blanket or, idk, a person with weak muscle tone. then ask said person with weak muscle done to cough. they don't cough normally/forcefully. it's more a ""strong puff"". similar to, again.... idk... a muted punch. when you're used to jumping at every strange sound, it's difficult to discern what's what sometimes. 

so, /u/piconeeks..... anything else you'd like to know? care to admit i *just might be* telling the truth? there were identify details i left out but guess y'all need them.",11
"trying to force someone into atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into christianity.. i am one of those atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. i would honestly rather just let people be. i don't think i am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. i have been seeing several threads on reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. albert einstein was a jew, does being an atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? no.

and it also makes me cringe when atheists try to force religious people into atheism. if we are going to strongly condemn christians trying to force others into christianity, we should condemn atheists trying to force atheism on to other people.

if it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

edit: thanks for bringing einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically jewish, growing up in a jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. that being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. isaac newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) christian. if you don't want to use scientists as an example, james madison, who wrote the bill of rights that is idolized by many, was also christian. the conclusion i am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.",6

"by not washing under my foreskin for the first 15 years of my life. this is long so tldr at the bottom.

this happened around 6 years ago when i was in 9th grade. i grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. my parents never taught me anything about genitals and i apparently never asked, all i knew was that's where the pee came out.

so one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. i was pretty shocked because that's certainly not how mine worked. by that time i was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!

so armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work i went home and a few google searches led me to discover that i had a severe case of phimosis. so being the pragmatic young buck that i am i also google how to fix it. there were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel i opted for the latter option. i got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom's bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.

after about 4 hours of stretching i finally started making some progress! i could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell i've ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. it dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. i kept stretching over the course of a few days and i started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as i stretched. some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as dick cheese. 

i cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. that was about to change real fucking fast.

so this was about 10 days into my stretching and i'd gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. i was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so i got very impatient and i decided i'd try to force it all the way back that day i lubed and got to work, i pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. i pulled it till i couldn't bear the pain anymore. i did this over and over again for around 3 hours until i somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. i got way too excited and despite the pain i gave it one big yank and i felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. it hurt like hell but i was just so relieved that i didn't care. i opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. the entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. that was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where i tore the top part of my foreskin when i yanked it over the glans. i freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. it eventually stopped and then i had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. i eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. i was still hurting but i was finally done. i got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. i thought that was it. i tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn't budge so i just left it.i completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. you know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? that's how my penis looked. i went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.

when i got home i was still in major pain so i decided i'd check on it. i undressed in the shower and looked down at it. the first thing i saw were the blisters. two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. the next thing i noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. i'm a black guy.

i realized that if i didn't find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. i lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. this was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. i kept trying to force it back over and i put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  my penis was on fire at this point and i was holding back tears but i kept pushing until i felt it pop back over the glans. judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain i felt i guess the second blister popped too. once again i left it and fucking went to bed. 

i checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. i rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks i was pretty much ok. my foreskin was still tight and i do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!

also please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. even if they aren't as stupid as i was don't take that risk lol

tl;dr; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because i got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn't get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. 

edit: so i didn't expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! 

so while i'm happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, i'd like to clear up something. this post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  rather, i'd like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. 

for those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. don't be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. they have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. for those of you who aren't old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. believe me it's not as awkward that you think. don't risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like.

"update overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

so i read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, i was doubting if i made the right decesion. i wasn't going to update because i didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days i came to a final conclusion.i want to clarify that i broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

after i broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. she would send me letters and call me a lot. in one of the texts i actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. i was about to agree, but something she said made me realize i would be making a mistake if i did. she said, ""i'll remember to respect from now on."" that sentence made me realize that i made the right choice by breaking up. since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

either way i'm glad i didn't give her a second chance. i don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

on a sidenote, the other day i was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and i guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that i moved on to fast. blocked her and had a laugh i know for a fact i made the right choice.",7

"caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result. i went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while i was away. i came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. my oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. i thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. took her to the icu and the doctor ran a lot of tests. the doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. she was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. this caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. she suffered for two days in the icu before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. there was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. i stayed by her side as they euthanized her. that was about 3 days ago. my heart is in pieces. 
there is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. but i have text messages of when i tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

i know i'm angry and grieving. but because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until i had to let her go.

"boyfriend and i slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out. this happened in ontario, canada.

so this past friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

i found out about it the next night at work (i work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and i were the night before. he filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

for more context, on the 24th of october a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. it has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (i sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

all we asked for was the alarm for our unit. luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

i dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. my dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. but i don't know. came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in ontario. 

edit: more direct questions; should we pursue action and report? if we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? i know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. i could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

tldr: boyfriend and i were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

"my college says if i miss class to testify at my assault trial, they'll drop me from my classes (update). op here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9gdico/my_college_says_if_i_miss_class_to_testify_at_my/?st=jn056nas&sh=90aa7f5f

thanks to everyone's terrific advice, i got my university's ombudsman involved, and also reached out to a local survivors group (similar to rainn) who connected me to a wonderful attorney who facilitated between me and the legal services team at my school. 

within a day of meeting with the school's general counsel, my attorney and i were invited to meet with the deans who had made the initial decision. 

one of my professors also apparently saw my legal advice post and put two and two together (my professors were not previously aware of the full extent of what was going on) and he and my other professors submitted a letter on my behalf protesting the administration's decision, copying the board, ombudsman, legal counsel, and high level members of the administration, which was so incredibly touching i am still overwhelmed and trying to properly thank them. 

between my professors' incredible gesture and my showing up with an attorney raising flags, at the meeting i was given carte blanche to work out the details of my absences between myself and my professors (i'll take them at school, just early) and two were able to give me modified assignments that could be done at home but still exemplified the same knowledge and skill sets. 

the ombudsman and the legal counsel assured me they are looking into the policy that caused this ordeal in the first place, the ombudsman in making sure the policy is being correctly and reasonably enforced **(e.g., not used to coerce students into violating a subpoena)** and the legal counsel is advising the administration on new guidelines for the policy so no one else has to experience this going forward.

"my (f 25) husband (m 28) said something disgusting to me. i can't stop thinking of it. i've been in the bath for a long time because i've been dreading going to bed with him. 

a few hours ago i was lying in bed feeding our baby. my husband was begging me to come do something with him. i tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  he kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

i just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

i could see he was starting to lose his patience and i told him ""honey i have to take care of him before you, you know that"". and what he said back was really stunning. he looked me right in the eyes and said ""if you love him so much, why don't you suck his dick instead of mine"". i couldn't say anything, i didn't know what to say. and then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

i don't even know what to make of this. what should i do? it just bothers me so deeply, it's going to be hard for me to forgive. i really don't have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. am i just being sensitive? maybe i'm just emotional, but i feel like crying.",7
"by overestimating my clit and losing sight in one eye.. well, fuck. 

not a throwaway because i have no shame left to feel. 

by orgasming so many times i went blind in one eye. that's right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. 

seriously, though. last night i was trying to sleep (obligatory ""not technically today"") but failing miserably. i have bipolar disorder, i'm off my medication (that is a in itself), and i was in the early stages of a manic episode. for those who aren't batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. i tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my mothman musical, and thinking about al gore. at about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, i decided i had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. 

enter stage left lesbian porn. here's the part where i mention how my clit is made of steel. i came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. for some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. having finished the porn (which i actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) i decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. now, whenever i'm jerking off to just my vile thoughts, i always have to go completely under the covers. unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where i live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? anyway, for some reason i can't come on my own if my head isn't under some blankets/cloaked. maybe saudi arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? since this incident i've only slept for four hours. i'm losing my mind. 

anyway, at this point i'm abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. after ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. my clit breathes a sigh of relief and i emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. my right eye is stinging a little bit, and i realise the acne treatment i'd put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. i grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.

i'm sure you can see where this is going, but i certainly didn't. and now i could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. i wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. the weird angle i'm bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. for some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. i felt genuinely betrayed. like, how dare you? you did this to me. this is your fault. et tu, clite? 

once my eye starts to swell up, i call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. arguably the weirdest walk of shame i've ever done. 

i continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn't go down, an eye patch. the swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. my eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of ""what the fuck have i done"" red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. 

now i've got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that i'll probably have to cancel. i've been wanting to bang this guy for weeks. also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and i can't even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish i'm shit out of luck. 

tl;dr: i masturbated and now i'm
down one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.

edit: sweet baby jesus's clit, what the fuck? this blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if i wrote it. damn my unforgettable mothman musical. anyway, i did not cancel my dick appointment. i told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (less endearing when i got to his place and wouldn't stop dirty talking using pirate puns. i've never been more grateful for the colloquialism ""booty""). also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. hallelujah.

"by tipping my pizza delivery driver $1100. so today i sold my bitcoin i bought 2 years ago i spent like $100 on the investment or something, i cashed it out at a bitcoin atm and brought it home the first thing i did to celebrate was buy some edibles. i buy some edibles eat a whole brownie and am out of it, i order some pizza and take some money from my wad and put it in a pile on the table next to me total was like 20 so i put 23.

since i'm high af the pizza delivery girl knocks i grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. i give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this is going to help me. freaked out and high i say okay and just rush inside.

right now after waking up being passed out i realize what i've done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.

"update i (28m) think my girlfriend (26f) of four years is going to leave me for her dying ex-boyfriend and first love.. link to previous post here (https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aejrnr/i_28m_think_my_girlfriend_26f_of_four_years_is/?st=jqrwkq4d&sh=e1753ed8)

i finally talked to my girlfriend about it and unfortunately, she is now my ex-girlfriend. a lot of things that i never expected to happen did happen in a span of hours. 

as soon as she opened the door to our apartment, i could tell that she was already starting to cry. seeing her so vulnerable like that also hurt because i didn't want to put her in that position. 

i had to constantly remind myself that none of this was my fault. 

we sat down, there were lots of tears. i thought i would be bitter, angry and that i would be screaming at her the whole time but i felt disappointed instead. 

i told her that i saw the messages and explained how i ended up scrolling through their whole conversation. 

she kept reasoning that she just felt sorry for him and that she didn't know how to say no to him because they go all the way back.

then i told her that we go more way back than they ever did. i was there through her lowest point, i helped her get up.

she admitted that they had sex more than three times. 

i saw it coming, i had a gut feeling but hearing her confirm it hurt so much. at that point, i was full on crying. i can't remember some of the things that happened because my mind was all over the place. it still is now. 

i remember telling her that i was done, that whatever we had was over. she kneeled in front of me and asked me to forgive her, i don't think i ever will. i can't tolerate people who cheat.

by that point, a third of my clothes were packed up. 

obviously she feels happier with him if she can do this to me. 

when i posted my first post, a redditor approached me and offered me a place to stay. his place was only around fifteen minutes away from ours and he picked me up. he'll also help me sell a lot of my stuff that i can't bring back home and will help me gather all my things back in my apartment.

we both agreed that i don't mention him in this post. i'm glad that i really opened up to this community instead of keeping it to myself. thank you to everyone who also offered me a place. 

it's almost 3am, i'm heartbroken as ever but i'm trying my best. i'm sending my resignation letter to work this morning. every person in my family now knows my situation here and have offered support. i'll be flying home as soon as possible. 

to all my aussie mates,  if you live near/around chapel hill, let me know! 

america, you were great but now it's time to come home. thanks for the help everyone.

edit: i'm crying again, not because i got cheated on but because i realised that there is a whole world out there that cares a lot for my well being. i almost can't believe i looked at hurting myself as an option to get away from the pain. i am really overwhelmed and also thankful for this community.

anthony and his wife, the redditor who helped me says this has been the most wholesome thing that ever happened to him. 

i may have lost a girlfriend and a future wife, but i gained heaps of friends...and even friends for a lifetime. 

other than that, i am feeling better. it still feels surreal that she's gone but what can a bloke do? she made her choice so i made mine. 

i woke up to multiple messages from her family saying that i shouldn't rush things and that she's stupid and makes mistakes like everyone else. 

it sucks that i may not be able to see her family for a long time, they were great people. i thanked them and said that although i believe in second chances and everyone makes mistakes, cheating is a choice that assholes pick, never a mistake. 

ex also emailed me around 5 in the morning. the email was too long, my eyes hurt from crying so i junked it straight away. 

i miss her like crazy. i know it will take a lot of time to heal me but i guess i can wait. 

ps. i'll message my newfound aussie friends when i go through all the comments. exact date of my flight hasn't been sorted out yet, but i'm hoping i'll be home by next month.

"the crew of 'return of the jedi' mocked the character design of admiral ackbar, deeming it too ugly. director richard marquand refused to alter it, saying, ""i think it's good to tell kids that good people aren't necessarily good looking people and that bad people aren't necessarily ugly people."".

"i negotiated salary for the first time ever, and i got what i wanted!. last tuesday, i did something irresponsible for the sake of my mental health and quit a job where i was miserable, without another job lined up. as the sole income provider this was a huge gamble, but i had an interview on friday that i was feeling really confident about. 

i should pause here to note two things: 1) i'm a codependent, and avoid conflict like the plague. 2) i am this way because of my childhood, being raised by my narcissistic mother. my former boss was exactly like her, hence why i left. 

so, i killed the interview on friday. met the two attorneys i would be working for. they are amazing and offered me a job at the end, but said that they would need the senior partner's approval first, so to wait for his call. 

i got the call this morning. we went back and forth a little bit. my starting point was $x, he wanted to offer x-$7k. he noted that health insurance is 100% employer-contributed, and not only was i getting 2 more weeks of pto than my last employer, but i would get pto on my bday (this is actually an awesome perk because mine almost always falls around a federal holiday, which means the potential for a paid 4-day weekend).

i said meet me at x-5k, so he said he'd do x-7 but cut me a personal check each month for gas allowance. when i incorporated that in, i was almost sold. my husband told me to ask for an additional $50. what's the worst he can say, no?

well, codependent me was terrified to ruffle the feathers. but i thought, although beggars can't be choosers, i'd potentially miss out on an extra $600 a year for the sake of not hurting someone's feelings. 

so i asked. and he actually said that he was taken aback, and felt like i was nickel and diming him! but you know what? i stuck with it. i said, ""yes, well, i am very eager to start, so if you can meet me there, i can start tomorrow."" he said he had to get back to me.

and wouldn't you know, he did. i got that extra allowance. i stuck to my guns. i put conflict aside to make sure he knew right off the bat that i know what i am worth. and it felt amazing.

you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. and let me also just add that it feels really good knowing you're earning a salary you can support a family on, and that you made it happen by being assertive. it's just a huge weight off my shoulders, that i won't have to worry about whether i can pay all the bills on time.

"by spending the last year on reddit talking to myself after being muted.. today was the day i realised i messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit 

for the last 12 months i've been commenting on peoples posts, i've created my own posts. i haven't had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as i can remember so i just figured i wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)

last month i started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren't showing, i could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. 

anyway, i finally mailed the help team and found out my ip was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it's all sorted now (and if you cant, i'm still in my own little truman show)

if you're procrastinating (and let's face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..

please dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that i've been such an idiot for so long. it's ok to laugh with/at me :)

edit 3: reddit is awesome. i've missed you guys! dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real pita. its just one of those things and i thank them for putting in the hours.

i also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. most of us here use reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.

"exwife is going off the deep end. this is in nj, usa. can i do anything here?. i get my daughter every other weekend. she's 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

this weekend, we were watching a movie when i got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

now, i don't attach myself to my phone (unless i'm working) and i got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

when i saw it, i told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and i also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that i told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

the movie ended around 9:10 pm and i had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. i told her i'd be up to tuck her in. 

i went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

he mother was screaming into the phone ""you tell him fuck you! you can say that! i say its ok for you to tell your father fuck you!!""

i took the phone from my daughter and i said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

she yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

i asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. my ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

i handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was saturday night so i bent the bedtime a bit). 

i had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

i walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""i'm sorry"" into the phone. i fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

i walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

it wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. she had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

i sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. she was really upset and wouldn't speak much. i hugged her. my daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

i'm sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. divorce is hard enough on children, and i think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be.

"if i told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?. so my situation is a little difficult so i thought i would confide in the good professional people of reddit. couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. we haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" i mentioned something along the lines that i smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (this was hard for me to tell because my whole life i was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) we both laughed about it saying ""just don't let mom find out"" the joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""i cheated on my wife..."" at first it didn't register until i saw his face and he was dead serious. i for one hate cheaters, but i try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. he begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. she would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. he told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. during this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. he told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. they've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (they have a kid) 
he told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

as stated before i hate cheaters and i've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. i know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. my heart tells me i have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because i've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. my brain tells me it's none of my business and i should keep my mouth shut. i don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. on one hand i betray my brother if i say something on the other hand i betray our close family friend because i know this secret and i don't say anything. i wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. so there it is, if i said something?

tldr: brother cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now i feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. wibta?

edit: i'm referring sil as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are very close lol. i thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just sil, but it looks like i was wrong.

"by giving my son permission to beat his bully's ass.. my son was born with a condition called pectus excavatum. in layman's terms, his chest is sunken in. his condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. in december, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. 

about three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. the kid has been through a lot. 

well, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. and because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, ""dad, i'm cleared now. a kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. can i kick his ass?"" well, my son isn't really a fighter. he's fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he's always gotten his ass kicked. so i just figured he was just talking. but this is the first i had heard about the bullying and i was concerned. i could tell he was distressed about the situation so i told him to knock the fucker out. he just nodded and went to his room. 

now, his older brother is s tough sob. he had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he's in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. i talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don't get in trouble. he told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. i asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. while i kinda agree with his thinking, i instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. 

the next morning i took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. on the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. ""have you taken xxxxx to school yet? well, after you do, go pick up your son. he got in a fight."" i just assumed it was my oldest son. imagine my surprise when i walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! he was beaming! he pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. ""i warned him."" i was so proud. 

he had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. my older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. he said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. he got suspended for three days. 

tl;dr i gave my son permission to beat up his bully because i didn't think he would and he did it.

edit one: the kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. it wasn't malicious. just two boys clowning around. he was horrified that he had hurt my son. the bully punched my son in the head every day. once he found out my son couldn't do anything about it, he just kept on. my son wasn't the only one he bullied, either. also, the bully's brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son could fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. 

edit two: my son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a lot of new friends. he used to hate going to school but now he's disappointed that school is out for summer. crazy!

"for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?. about two months ago, my husband and i got ""married"" in a beautiful ceremony. it was so much fun. we went on a honeymoon after. the price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it's their only daughter's wedding. as a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or i could afford! my husband and i paid the rest — his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

the wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. about a year and a half ago, i was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). i had recently graduated from school and didn't have health insurance. my husband and i decided to get married so i could join his health insurance. it was a quick justice of the peace ceremony. we were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. a few months after that, he ""proposed"" (something i didn't see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. we weren't trying to be deceptive. however, part of it was that i wasn't comfortable revealing my health issues. my husband respected this. my parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. his mom (i'll call her carol) and i aren't close. she's fine enough in low doses, but...

we're currently in the process of moving. this past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. as we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must've slipped out. carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. and then she noticed the date. 

carol lost it. she insisted we lied to everyone. she said our wedding ceremony was just a ""gift grab"" (our wedding website stated that someone's presence was gift enough— we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). carol went and called her twin sister, my husband's aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. she said we were sneaky and deceptive. she is saying she may want her gift back—something we are fine with giving her. 

for me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so i could get insurance. a means to an end. our wedding date is what we will celebrate. are we assholes for not being more upfront? i've been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. my husband insists we are not assholes.",3

another point i'd like to make is if you agree that people shouldn't be ashamed of what their ancestors did then by symmetry they shouldn't be proud either. current mongols don't need to feel ashamed of ghengis khan. i don't think modern germans should be held responsible for hitler. that also means they shouldn't get credit for the great things their ancestors have done either.

edit2: because there is some confusion, i'm not white. i actually made this post with white nationalism and stefan molyneux in mind. this logic should still apply to any race, gene, or whatever pre birth lottery you won/lost",6

"i think my boyfriend has been drugging me to make me forget things. he is a doctor.. this is in north texas. 

hey so i must apologize if this post is jumbled a bit. i started typing it up in word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. 

i think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. i know this is going to be hard to explain, but i have been having gaps in memory that i have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  i was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then i started to notice that this seems to happen when i go on dates with him. 

i know it must be crazy, but i have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  i know its him as… well i wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would… 

the first time it happened was when we were drinking and i wrote it off as too much to drink. we get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. but then there were a few times when i know we were not drinking. 

i decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. i had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time i talked with him. i remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. my car and his car was in the parking lot too so i was confused. 

i decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.

after 3 days at his place i remembered everything so i was started to trust him again. knowing he was an ent i know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor. i was going to ask him about my issues when he randomly pointed to these red bumps on my thigh and said i should be treating those sores. 

i had completely forgotten they were there. these little red bumps that look like needle injections that got infected. i got so freaked out he mentioned them that i decided to leave. 

the next day he came over to ""check on me"" and i remember waking up in bed with more dried semen on my chest. 

then today he met me for lunch saying we had agreed to meet. i never agreed to me with him and would never want to. he does this all the time, saying we agreed to do something i have no memory of. 

i am sick and tired of it and want him punished. 

this has started to affect my work life as well as i start to get paranoid when i see a boss walk into a room after making eye contact with me. i get paranoid that they are about to fire me. my friends also state i have been acting strangely and out of character. i have even begun to lose sleep and sleepwalk when i do.  

is there a way to have blood work done to see what kind of drug he is using on me? i do not want the police to blow me off and push me away as some crazy lady so i want to be damn sure when i go to the police.

"if i ask my pregnant wife to move out because she and her best friend decided to ""test"" my loyalty?. my wife is pregnant with our daughter. initially we were really happy and excited about it. but then, she starts acting like a nut job. she gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food i make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.

for example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. well, i made chicken sandwiches. so she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. i wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. but if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? when i asked her this she told me that she was hungry. ok fine. she does this every time. eats everything i make and calls it shit. i don't argue with her because i work for more than 80 hours a week and i really want to have some peace when i'm home.

so, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if i wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. i rejected her and told her that i was married. and when i got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. when i asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. so they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. and i passed. yay!!. i'm really pissed. i'm done with her antics. if i ask her to move out?

"31m husband cheated on 27f me with his fit and skinny gym friend. i came home from work early (i'm an ob nurse so my hours are pretty unpredictable) and found female sneakers in the garage that weren't mine. at that point, i sort of already knew what i'd be walking into. my husband has recently become very fit and has been consistently going to the gym, during which he made a female friend who he even brought home for dinner last week. she's beautiful and thin and everything i am not, which instantly made me feel horrible. so, i talked to him about it. he encouraged me to build my confidence and reassured me he loved me and would always be loyal to me.

i walked into the laundry room from the garage and sort of tiptoed around the house before going upstairs. they were having sex. in our bed. with a framed picture from our wedding above the nightstand next to it. i silently left the room and got back in my car with tears streaming down my face and drove to get food and just sat in my car crying since. its now almost 1am (walked in on them at 7pm) and i've returned to the hospital. he called me asking why i wasn't home and i told him my shift is extended but in reality, i'm laying in one of the on call rooms bawling my eyes out as i type this.

i feel so worthless and ugly and stupid. i don't even know how to proceed. on one hand i want to divorce him and never see him again, but on the other hand, i'm an ugly woman....its not like i can do better. i just want to die. i feel so gross and the self-loathing is getting too much right now. advice please.

edit: thank you all for the kind comments and support. please stop commenting, however. i think i've heard just about everything (including some horrible things about my weight). i don't care about ""internet points"" or whatever and the notifications are getting crazy. reading through these comments has been a nice way to keep myself sane these past few hours. i still have no idea what i am going to do and i know everyone wants me to leave, but a marriage is more than can be illustrated with a couple of words on a website. he was a great husband and i can't help but feel at fault for neglecting myself weight-wise. i don't know if i will stay, but that's all i really know right now.

"(va) my son stole a rare toy from my brother. my brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. what do i do?. right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. here is the story.

&#x200b;

last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. while we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. my brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what i know it's one of his biggest hobbies. well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200b;

well, until yesterday. my brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and i needed to return it immediately. i honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a boba fett figure from his collection. he confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200b;

i was furious and took it from him. here is the problem though, after i confirmed with my brother it was his i found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. so my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. i told him i would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200b;

honestly, what are my options here? i can't afford to pay him back right now. if he does go the police will my son get arrested? he's only 15. it was very wrong of him to do but i think my brother is over reacting. what can i expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",2
"i destroyed my work project, and i hope i get fired. &#x200b;

this is petty. i don't care.

i've worked at a company for two years. in that time, i've gone from an 'incredible asset to the company' to 'babysitter'.

i wish i was joking.

this company is owned by several people, but managed by a relative to the higher ups. a guy who has never worked for anyone except his mommy (who owns the company). a guy who is incapable of doing basically anything for himself. someone who will 'one day' take over the company, who currently can't even figure out bluetooth.

moron would be a compliment. you think i'm just being harsh on my boss, or exaggerating.

i wish. i wish it was just me being dramatic.

last phonecall i had from him was him asking where he was. no, i'm serious.

""foot, i'm driving. where am i?""

he asks me to track his phone, find his location, see if i can find a store near him that sells a certain item (that he can't remember the name of the store either, or where it is exactly), and then i am to gps voice navigate him there using track his phone to tell him when to turn.

this is my life. 50+ phone calls a day from this man.

""foot, did you get my email?""

""yes, i responded to it and answered your questions.""

""oh good. read it out to me.""

proceed to read the email to him. he is happy.

fast forward two hours. get a scathing email from him, responding to my reply:

""foot, why did you email me again when we just talked about this on the phone?! this wastes my time.""

i no longer do my regular job. i've been transitioned into this 'personal assistant' role, even though i did not want it. at all. to the point i'm currently searching for a new job.

the company is bleeding money like someone cut off both of its legs. boss is supposed to be figuring out why, but the guy can't even pour himself a cup of coffee from the machine we've had for six *years.*

in my day to day, i also assist other departments. i have access to various software. i work alongside multiple managers and assist with their projects as well (when i'm not being asked to identify the brand of socks boss is wearing so that he can figure out where to buy more, and have me call to 'have them set aside a package for me so i don't have to walk through the store looking for these like an idiot')

based on my observations, i found several problems that are costing us money. either by purchasing, distribution or just general lack of adaquate price adjustments. some were serious enough that i even spoke to a different department manager, who was impressed and took me to the ceo to ask if i can be moved to their department to help fix some of the identified problems.

ceo is boss's mother.

i get told that i absolutely am not allowed to transfer. that i am far too valuable as a personal assistant to be shared with other departments. that boss will handle and oversee the changes that need to be made.

manager and i were stunned. turns out, mother wants to step away from the company and wants boss to run it. that boss just needs more projects to work on to get a better understanding of how to run the company.

boss gets called in, told that i identified several issues and that boss needs to get them resolved. boss gets mad at mother, telling her he doesn't have time to do that. mother says she understands, that he is a very busy boy. (again, i'm not joking. sitcoms can't even write this kind of shit).

boss later calls me into his office, and tells me that i am to work on fixing all of these issues, but that i'm to give him all my notes, tell him how i fixed it and he will present it to the board. boss then proceeds to leave for the day, calling me later to ask what kind of mustard was the mustard he liked the most on his deli sandwiches. then proceeded to lecture me on mustard, because the answer i gave him was obviously not the right kind of mustard and that i need to pay more attention to things like that.

i hung up the phone, picked up all my notes on this 'bleeding money' situation / project and shredded them.

oops. sorry! i'm too much of an idiot to handle doing any type of investigation work into our financial records for the past 5 years. i'm certainly too much of an idiot to notice that your profit margins went from 32% to less than 18.3% on the majority of our products we manufacture, all the while giving our distributors more than 46% discount so that they 'keep coming back for more'.

here is hoping boss can figure that out, especially considering the layoffs we keep having.

excuse me while i make note of what kind of mustard he prefers on his montreal smoked meat sandwich, which is a much more important use of my time.

because, in the words of boss: ""maybe one day you'll be capable, like me, if you keep working at it.""

i hope i get fired.

"if the only reason you pay for amazon prime is because of 2-day shipping, there is a good chance it's a smarter financial move for you to cancel it than continue.. this got removed from r/lifeprotips so let's see how it goes here...

i've paid for prime since it was available, and lately i've noticed it's gotten increasingly worse with shipping.

**fyi** \- prime doesn't mean you will get an item in 2 days, it means you **should** get the item 2 days **after** it ships, and there will often be multiple days between order and ship date meaning *a $119 prime membership often gets items delivered to your door 3-5 business days or more after you order*.

edit: they also no longer offer a 1 month prime extension for shipping errors(https://www.dealnews.com/features/amazon-quietly-killed-a-popular-prime-shipping-perk/2207696.html)

**example**

* you place 24 orders on amazon prime over the course of a year
* 4 of those orders arrive over 2 days after you place them online due to multiple days ""processing"" or shipping errors (for me it has been much worse than this)
* that effectively means you paid $5.95/order for 2 day shipping

look at how often you purchase, how quickly items are delivered, and decide if that's worth paying $119 for. if you only have it for the 2 day shipping there is a good chance it's not, especially when you consider many other online retailers carry the same items and now ship free with walmart (i know they're the devil but it looks like amazon might be too) even offering free 2 day shipping on many items without an extra membership fee.",10
"my gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where i proposed.. i decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. i flew her to vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in cambodia. she had wanted to see angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. after a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together i proposed and she said yes. we kissed and i had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. it's really beautiful. she took a shower and i laid in bed thinking what an amazing day i just had and how i would get to spend the rest of my life with the women i loved. when she came out of the shower however she was in tears. she handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

i played it cool and said i understood but truthfully it hurt. it seems to me that i had offered her something of value. a lifelong commitment and partner. i took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. i felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. it was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. if she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. so she can't possibly value me or what i have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place i asked. 

i'm preparing to end things when we get back. she wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but i'm done. am i wrong? should i do it over? what do you think.

* **11:00am friday:** submitted a complaint to the consumer finance protection bureau (cfpb - https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/(https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/))
* **12:00pm friday:** my wife called me and told me jonathan stickland's assistant had called her to gather more information and said she would be making some calls to see what they could do for us.
* **4:00pm friday:** wife called me to let me know that someone from bank of america's ""regulatory complaints department"" had called her in regards to the cfpb complaint filed earlier in the day. he called at 10 minutes before his office closed and my wife didn't get the message until after. we planned to call monday morning.
* **9:00am saturday:** wife wakes me up and says the money is back in the account as a ""misc credit""
* **9:00am today:** i call cfpb. they say the complaint is still open with the bank and they usually respond within 15 days.
* **9:00am today:** i call the number left by bofa's regulatory complaints department. leave a voicemail. wife calls him from work and leaves a voice mail
* **1:00pm today:** we get a notification from bank of america that the dispute is closed. we're done. we will wait until the notice comes in the mail before we shut our accounts and move.

i hope that anyone else in our situation now or in the future can use this to get some fast results too.

what's some juicy gossip you just found out in your personal lives?. ,1
"by c*mming so hard i fainted. so this happened a couple of days ago..

had a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. after changing back to my old wash and my rash didn't showing any indication of subsiding, i went to visit a dermatologist. anyways, turns out i have a skin condition called pityriasis rosea, which isn't actually serious and should go away on its own. so she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. after showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and i sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. i noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back reaalllyyy good. so naturally i took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. naturaly i decided to take it to the next logical level: flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (yes i know this sounds mildy retarded). what ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. i busted a nut so hard i started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and i fucking fainted. my parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a reaaal worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. so yeah, my mother hasn't looked me in the eye for like 2 days. fml

tl;dr: found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided i wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. came so hard i went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.

i'm legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol

"dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. how do i protect myself legally?. i have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. a few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

the last few months have been hell. they have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. they are loud way past our community quiet hours. they have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). i have recorded it. it wakes up my 2 year old. do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

they leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. it has ruined my outdoor rug. i took pictures. 

they drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

they regularly park in the reserved spot i pay for monthly. it is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. they are an extra $50 a month. the minute i leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until i threaten to involve the apt. manager.

they have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

they like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. i have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. it ruined my potted plants outside. 

i have reported all the incidents. i have tried to ask them to cut it out. they don't care. 

i recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out i am not the first to complain that day. the police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (i am not sure of how it was found. i stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

since then they have taken to recording me any time i leave my apartment. they have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

the woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how i am impeding her ability to exist in public because i am racist. she says i call the police on her for doing nothing. i only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

i understand i am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. i would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

i just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot i pay for monthly, and play loud music i can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

she had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

they have really upped the bleach game too. it has gotten on a few spots on my door and i am scared they might throw it at my car. 

i have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. i can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

i can't lose my job and i am not sure how protect myself legally. 

they are actually my paid space right now but i am scared to have them towed because i don't know what they are going to do. i pay for that space. i have proof. the sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

if i tell the apartment they will have the car towed but i'll look like a racist. 

all it takes is one video and a lie and i am ruined. 

i want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but i think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that i pay for is reasonable. but maybe not?",2

its been awhile since my original post, but i didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

since then, not much has improved. i decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. to my surprise, she agreed and i was so happy.

unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  i had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

this was the hardest thing i have ever had to do.  i feel so broken right now.  i'm going to see a counselor in hopes that i can figure out what to do.

i dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but i pray that she takes advantage of it because i still love her and i did this because i still do.

i told myself i would stop enabling her, mainly because i just cannot sustain this life. i am physically and mentally exhausted.  my kids are my top priority but i cant take care of them if i dont first take care of myself.

i thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. she was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and i hope that it will help her.

we live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he's been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. he's been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. i thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt i get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. they are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.

i ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. i used his email on the sign-up so that i could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he'd have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.

one small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. i sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which i mean i entered the password he's shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. i simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. i know how to do this because i'm a brilliant hacker (i googled it).

while carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: a shipping confirmation for an engagement ring. i immediately noped off his computer, and of course i didn't open the email, but the damage is done. secret's out!

my heart fell right through my butt, you guys. i actually died and now i'm a ghost writing this.

i probably should have pretended i never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but i was too pumped and couldn't keep it in. within the hour i broke down and called ray to sheepishly confess what i had done. he wasn't angry, but sadly disappointed that i spoiled the surprise. 

here's the kicker: he didn't actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.

my punishment for snooping is that the suspense is killing me. i've been forbidden from telling anyone that we're getting engaged until it's officiated. every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!

a romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying ""damn, i thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.""

""why would you think that i'm going to propose to you?"" he said. ""that sounds like something you wouldn't know about because i'd keep it secret in my personal email!""

now he's started intermittently faking me out. the other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. he keeps getting down on one knee... looking up at me... and saying, ""gotta tie this shoe!"" the emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is maddening. every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.

one more thing: i somehow fucked up the email settings. the shipping confirmation for the underwear didn't get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. so that surprise got spoiled, too. turns out i'm not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.

i guess it's not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and i do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.

if we ever do actually get married it'll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.

"wife had yearly review today. instead of a higher wage, they converted everyone from hourly to salary, but her overall salary reduced by 14k per year.. wife works for a very small start up company with 4 people, 2 owners and 2 employees. she is in design. past year she was working at $35/hr full time with health benefits but no paid vacation. $35/hr is very fair for her skillset in design especially for los angeles. she was on wage, not salary. she worked some ot but not a whole lot. if you calculate the standard hourly to salary using 40 hours a week multiply 52, she would have earned $72,800. she is normally scheduled to work full time mon to fri 9-5. however last year we got married and had vacations here and there and she was compensated $55,000 total because of the unpaid vacations. this worked out well for her small company because she didnt get paid while being away. 

today during her evaluation, they low balled and offered  a salary of $54,000 with $3800 pto/year. health benefits are also included but it is the same as last year. the total compensation now is $57,800. they said this was calculated based on the number of hours worked last year (so they pretty much offered her 2018 w2). employees are not going back to wage. 

i would assume an employer would calculate a salary offer based on potential full time hours, not how many hours one worked the year prior.  if she had pto last year  or if she didnt go on the long honey moon then she would have received a higher salary offer. now her starting salary is pretty much $27/hr so its a huge downgrade and now without ot. the owners said ""well look we are giving you pto now!"" which would offset the low ball. she is valuable at her company— 70% of products sold are her designs. the other employee got a raise cause he was getting significantly less paid last year (due to no degree and no experience) in case you were wondering. 

is this practice normal for an employer to use previous year's w2 to determine someones salary, especially if it works in their advantage? she will try to counter back with equity (since she started the company with them). during their meeting yesterday, they stated that employees' salary do not require 40hour work periods — only the projects need to be done. because of that she wants to request working a maximum of 32 hours a week to offset the 14k a year reduction. any advice?

**1st edit** i shouldnt have wrote this long piece and gone to sleep. i will answer everyone when i get to a computer. thanks for all your help. 
first thing, i need to recalculate her w2 because she definitely didn't take 3 months off which everyone is calculating.  a big piece is missing here. i saw that in the last 17 paychecks she got paid 43k and i need to double check

second, she is very valuable to her team. anyone is replaceable but she is more difficult to replace. she knows their vision, she came up with the  company name, and all her designs are most of the ones being sold now, plus she designed the logo, all the packaging, website, everything. everything has been her idea. when she pointed out the products to me on their website, most of them were either made by her or she had some type of influence directing the other designer. she had some creative director responsibilities too.

the reason why they are doing salary is because ""it helps employees out"" by more flexible scheduling (dont need to go in if work is all done).  this is true. however they r low balling her because they are not making any money right now and simply cant afford her right now. (its true they arent making money). she asked for equity at the first meeting yesterday and they said ""thats probably not the best idea for you because we arent worth much."" wtf! 

**2nd edit**
i am reading a lot of responses and they are all helpful but i can't respond to all of them. one thing to clarify is that i know for a fact she didn't take 12 weeks of vacation. thats ludicrous! they did shut down for 2 weeks or so during the holiday, and she didnt get paid for it. she also doesnt get paid for holidays (like during thanksgiving and such). we took a max of 3-4 weeks of vacation last year, not 12. i am going to sit down with her tonight to get the math straight.

"orange juice with pulp is better than orange juice without pulp. i like the way the orange bits goes down my throat, and it gives me a sense that this juice hasn't been tinkered with as much as the other juice.. for the other juice, the people making it have to sift through the goodness, and the juice is no longer in its natural form. the idea of biting into a juicy orange evokes memories from when i tried to sneak orange juice from the fridge when i was younger. and a bit of orange rind and bits makes the juice a lot more interesting, rather than just a regular liquid.",6
"the death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.. generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. frankly, i believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

the child leaves almost nothing behind. it's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   on the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. they had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

i don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking i think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

the funeral service was held this past thursday. before then, i brought all the advice i received online and brought it to the real world and talked to both my therapist and sponsor about how i was feeling and what i should do. 

my sponsor was straight with me and told me that i would be putting myself in danger by going and that i should do something else that day to grieve. 

when thursday rolled around, i was a mess. i seriously considered both just going to the funeral or using again but instead i grabbed my dog and we went on a road trip.

"update: my friend is about to ask his girlfriend to marry him, but i'm the only one who knows how unfaithful she is. do i say anything?. original post is here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bicdpm/my_friend_is_about_to_ask_his_girlfriend_to_marry/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so i got lots of feedback on what to do here. a good majority of the commenters told me to say something. to clarify, it may not have been clear in the op but i was never planning on doing nothing. of course you gotta tell your bro if they're being cheated on. i just was not sure how to approach the situation. 

some of the commenters gave me some very helpful advice. some of you told me to talk to the girlfriend first, some of you told me to wait, some told me to gather a bunch of evidence first which i ended up getting from alison, the third party friend. some of you guys got angry with me for not telling him sooner, told me i was a bad friend. some were sure he wouldn't believe me, some predicted the gf would deny it all. well all of you were somewhat right. here's how it went down: 

i messaged alison early on in the day, shortly after i made the post because typing it all out brought my guilt and apprehension from the situation to the surface. i said to alison that i needed to tell aaron, and asked whether or not she had proof. this was when she sent me the screenshots of the text messages. 

aaron came over at around 8, and what was great was that alison came over too. we all sat down and talked for a bit, and we all told him our suspicions about mary. alison showed him the text screenshots of mary talking to her ex, and also told aaron all the stories she shared about her sexual encounters. 

what was the most surprising was his reaction. he took it very well. he first got very quiet, and just nodded. aaron ended up telling us that he had a sneaking suspicion that something was going on. he was not aware of the hookups, but he and mary had gotten into fights before over the fact that she doesn't allow him near any other girls, but she goes out and flirts with other guys all the time. he told us that she had been distant lately, and would leave rather often without telling him where she was going. there were a few other small things he mentioned that told us he was just generally unhappy with his relationship. he knew in his gut something was wrong, but wanted to believe it wasn't true. 

we started unwinding with some alcohol after that and it all got way more emotional. he cried, talking about how he felt stupid for not seeing it sooner, how he really loved her and would've given her anything. then he got angry. at her, and even more so at the guy. some unpleasant and derogatory terms were used to describe her. 

ultimately he told us that he's going to be breaking it off at least for now. we told him a million times how much better he deserved. he's definitely not going to marry her. 

thanks again all for the supportive words and advice. we saved a good man from heartbreak!

he kills time walking around the mall, does some window shopping, buys an ice cream cone, etc.  finally the two hours are up and he goes back to the mechanic.

""oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.

the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.

so, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""excuse me, but that was something else. you must've had a fantastic sex life together. is there some sort of secret to this?""

shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,

"my(28m) wife(27f) left me for 3 months and recently begged me to take her back, i said no and no everyone seems to be against me, i need some advice strangers. well let me give some background information as the situation will be hard to understand without it.

7 years ago i got married to the girl of my dreams denise(fake name), we had been dating for 2 years before that and it was like a dream come true, that changed after our marriage. after our marriage she constantly started feeling down and out of it and eventually i got her to go to a doctor who sent her to a therapist and from there we found out she had depression to do with things from her past that she was trying to forget. i decided to be as supportive as i could be, i took care of most of the house work, despite working 40 hours a week and told her to just get herself in order and if she needed to talk to me i would be there for her.

that was 6 and a half years ago, before she left she was still depressed, she basically only lays in bed and complains, she does nothing, we had no intimacy, no sex, no cuddles, no going out, my entire day was filled with work and house work. day in and day out i worked my ass off, came home to a mess of a house and started cleaning up, starting dinner and so forth at the end of the day i was exhausted and all i could expect was for denise to unload more of her trouble on me and complain about herself, me and everything around her. i could not even hang out with my buddies to get away from it all as she would relentlessly call me saying she was scared and everything so i also had no social life, not that i had time for it anyway...but despite it all i pushed through hoping that sooner or later she would break out of it and we could have a proper life together as i loved her and as they say for better and worse and this was quite clearly worse, possibly the worst it would ever be.

4 months ago she got a new therapist and 3 months ago that therapist suggested she needed time away from me as her depression started when we married so i may be the cause of it, the moment she told me i was crushed, i started doubting myself, blaming myself, worrying, but beneath it all this creeping sense of having done everything for her, having sacrificed years of my life as a cashcow and a servant for her to lay in bed and this is my thanks? it is my fault now? but i rejected that feeling, trying to talk through it, but she decided to leave and stay with her mother, saying she needed time away from me and that i may be the cause of her depression and so forth, honestly the entire argument is a blur in my head.

i spend the next month when she moved out calling her, her family, begging and humiliating myself just to get her back, apologizing for everything i may have done wrong, honestly i was close to ending it all as i was so hopeless at that point. but that month passed and as it passed i couldn't help but feel relieved, i came home and it was quiet, i could indulge in my hobbies which i had not done in years, the place was not a mess every time i came home, i could relax and two months in i even realized i could hang out with my buddies again, grabbing a beer, enjoying life and slowly i started to realize that i had been miserable this entire time. slowly that turned in to more and more realizations before i realized i honestly did not love her anymore, i felt like my youth was wasting away, i could do much, much better than this, i felt like i was a caretaker of a handicapped old lady, hell i still looked good and as i went out i started once again gaining back my self confidence, women would flirt with me, i felt wanted even though i never did flirt back.

after all these realizations i suddenly got a call from my wife, saying she made a huge mistake, she was sobbing her eyes out and how she was an idiot taking the therapists words as fact and how much she loved me. for a moment i wanted to say yes, yes please come back...but i couldn't, i just blurted it out and said to her she had left me and i was done with this relationship, i told her i would get divorce papers and i told her i had wasted enough time as it was and this final action of hers was the nail in the coffin, after that i just dropped the phone, started crying for a bit before turning in and feeling liberated.

the issue now is, is that everyone in my family is telling me i am making a mistake, i should take her back, i owe it to her to try and make it work, marriage is not always fun etc. the thing is, i never had fun in this marriage, i can't remember the last time i had fun and wasn't miserable, we are both young and fit and we never even go out, hell the last time we had sex is over a year ago, all i am to her is a fucking servant as it seems and i rather live along then spend one more hour taking care of her. but on the other end, i doubt myself, am i really dumping someone that is depressed? i feel horrible about it, i feel like a failure...i just need advice.

edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

minor update: i advised him of his many options after reading the comments. he went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

i'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. the mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room.

"co my retired piano teacher who sexually abused me has started teaching children again. i fear that she intends to abuse other children and i want to stop it. i have proof of her abuse against me. how do i go about this?. between the ages of 9-11, i took piano lessons with a teacher who sexually abused me. if memory serves, i believe that she did it almost every week for the 2 years that i took lessons with her. the only reason i stopped going to her was because she retired. 

my teacher used to take photos of the abuse (polaroids), and would give them to me, under the guise that it was ""our special secret"". i won't get into specifics, but i have possession of several photographs of the abuse where both me and my teacher are clearly identifiable.

i never told my parents or anyone else about the abuse or the photos due to immense shame and guilt.

recently, i found out that this woman has decided to start teaching again, but specifically becoming  a children's instructor. i am absolutely certain that she intends to hurt more children just like me, and i want to stop it before it's too late.

so my question is: legally, what can i do and what should my course of action be? i don't want money, i just want her stopped.

i have the photographs, but i am worried of the legal repercussions of having them in my possession, as they are technically child pornography.

please walk me through this, because i genuinely don't know what to do, and i'm scared she's going to hurt someone else and it will be all my fault because i didn't stop it sooner.

so the first thing i do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  and oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  

""are you looking for a mellow body high?  or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?""

""yes, yes and yes!""  i reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  in hindsight, if i learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like ""what is an ounce?"" or ""how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?""  sure, i can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite avogadro's number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.

and it was at this dispensary that i also learned that you can't actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and i were staying at).  as a result, before leaving, i begged my wife to buy some edibles that i could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  after expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.

when we finally get back to the hotel room, i tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  what the fuck, denver?  seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that i should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.

""dose size: 1/2 cookie,"" i read silently as i start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  but what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  so a second later, i covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. 

and then i quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  we may not have legal weed back home, but i routinely devour an entire package of milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  your move, tiny gingersnaps.   

about 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents' rental car on the way to dinner.  and that's when things start to go tits-up.  my stomach growls.  loudly and angrily.  my wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say ""diarrhea?""  but i merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.

""you didn't eat a whole cookie, did you?"" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.

""of course not."" i respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.

a few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  i don't remember how i made it to my seat, and i don't remember even looking at the menu, but i do remember the concerned look on the waiter's face as he asked me if i was doing alright.

""keep it together, man,""  i say to myself.  but my wife's sudden groan suggests that i may have also said that to the waiter.  things are going downhill fast.

the waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. 

the moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  i start to worry that the jig is up.  

""you are sweating... from your entire face,"" she says with both pity and disgust.  not quite knowing what to do, i reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  

at this point, my wife's mom looks over at me with some concern.  ""are you alright?"" she asks kindly.

""yeah, the food's just a bit spicy,"" i reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   

my wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. 
""bathroom. now."" she hisses. ""get it together.""  i reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  after splashing several handfuls of water on my face, i approach a urinal and start to pee.  

now, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  as i am peeing, i start to get the very unsettling feeling that i have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.

but deep down i know that is absurd:  i've been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  i've probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  so given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like i am about half way done -- that means that i've probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?

but the guy at the urinal next to me doesn't respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  i try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. 

after finally finishing, i again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table ""for being gone such a long time"" just in case my math was off. 

next, i try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife's father, but i am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --
 or, really, at any moment -- i figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  to my wife's horror, i stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  but he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he'll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  he also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren't too spicy for me, i should probably eat one or two so that i'm not sitting there on an empty stomach.

smart man. 

however, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, i start to get worried that i need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  ""do you think i should flag down the waiter again and ask what's taking so long?"" i suggest helpfully to my wife.

""what?! we literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.""

and at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  ""how many cookies did you eat?!"" she demands.

""whoa, easy there, torquemada,"" i respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  ""i had a few cookies, but keep it down.  i don't want your parents to know how fucked up i am right now.""

""really?!  they are sitting two feet away from you.  they know.""

i look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.

tl;dr: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.


edit:  wow!  thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  i think i have officially peaked in life.

as for part ii of the story, there's a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  at that point, my wife's singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before i either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  so after a few spastic, two-handed waves ""good-bye"" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a secret service agent evacuating the president.  my night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at ""getting handsie"" back in the hotel room.  but being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: ""please don't die, we have a mortgage.""",4
"for i telling my childhood bully (who is mtf transgender) that she will always be the ""boy who bullied me""?. when i was a in middle school, i was viciously bullied by this boy, who i'll call z. he spread rumours about me, called me stupid and useless every chance he got, and made school a living hell. 

it's been 12 years, and z has since come out as mtf transgender. she messaged me over social media and asked to meet up. we went out for coffee, where she apologised for bullying me. it was along the lines of, ""i'm sorry for being mean. i was young, and i was struggling with my gender identity.""

i thanked her for her apology. when she asked if she was forgiven, and i tried to avoid answering. i am still not over what she did to me. what z did to me impacted me greatly, as i was a impressionable young girl. i struggled with self esteem for years afterwards. 

z started getting defensive. she told me that i was being petty and that i should forgive her. i told her, ""why? you will always be the boy that bullied me.  an apology won't change that."" she got really offended when i said the word boy, and said that i was misgendering her. she called me a petty, transphobic, vindictive, and ignorant, then stormed out.

"eli22: personal finance tips for older young adults (us). yes, it's me....back with a second installment in our series, eli22.  this assumes you read eli18(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tfc76/eli18_personal_finance_tips_for_young_adults_us/) ( even the links...you'll learn 10x more from the links!) and have done  things pertaining to your situation.  

the ""22"" here  means you're done with full-time education, have a career with meaningful income, and are responsible for your own support.  some people start this at 18, some at 26; age is not important.  specifics pertain to the us in some cases.  this assumes you are a single childless renter employee; eli30(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4uoycd/eli30_personal_finance_tips_for_thirtysomething/) will cover marriage, home ownership, and children.

you have money now, congratulations!  read this(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) excellent summary of how to handle it.  here's a ginormous flowchart(https://i.imgur.com/1rpekgq.png) showing what to do first: bills? loans?  investments?  good self-study!  we'll highlight three big ideas to get you started.

- **taxes**. your employee income is taxed / withheld like so: 7.5% of the first $118k goes to social security/medicare taxes(https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751.html). (we hope you will benefit in the future, too!)  then your income is taxed at higher rates(http://taxfoundation.org/article/2016-tax-brackets) as you make more.  assuming no special deductions, 0% for the first 10k due to standardish deductions.  then 10% of the next 9k, 15% of the next 28k, and then 25% tax rate kicks in; this is your rate from 48k  to 102k gross income, so a popular rate.  (it's only 28% up to 200k, as well.)  this is your tax bracket / marginal tax rate.  (most states also have state income taxes of ~6%ish but they vary a lot.)  higher brackets only affect your additional income; you always come out ahead(http://blog.taxact.com/how-tax-brackets-work/) even if more income means a new top tax bracket.   you reduce your taxes with credits and deductions(http://money.howstuffworks.com/personal-finance/personal-income-taxes/tax-deductions.htm).  big idea 1 is: reduce your current taxes(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes) by making less of your income  taxable.

- **debt**.  you borrow money now so you can spend it, yay!  but then you have to pay it back, and typically pay back more than you borrowed, boo!  you've lost money as a result.  the extra amount you repay is determined by the interest rate(http://banking.about.com/od/loans/a/calculate-interest-you-pay.htm); the annual rate is called apr.  
3% apr student loan?  you'll pay $30 annual interest on $1000.  not bad.  
12% apr car loan?  you'll pay $120.  not good.  
  23.9% apr credit card?  you'll pay $239.  yikes!  (never do this!)
you repay the money you borrowed, too; that's called principal.  the longer you take to repay the loan,  the smaller each payment, but the more interest you'll then pay.  it's a tradeoff.  big idea 2 is: reduce the amount of interest you pay(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) by getting lower interest rates, and avoiding / quickly repaying higher interest debt.

- **investing**.  in eli18, i noted bank interest won't make you rich.  the good news in eli22 is: investments can make you  current millionaire rich(http://www.bankrate.com/calculators/savings/save-million-calculator.aspx).  the catch is: it takes decades, and you must regularly invest significant sums.  this why you start at 22!  the eli22  introduction to investments is based on the target date fund(http://www.finra.org/investors/target-date-funds-find-right-target-you), wherein you buy shares of a mostly stock-based index  fund  designed to be worth a lot more when you retire at a target date 40+ years in the future.  historically, these accounts gain about 6% annually(http://www.thesimpledollar.com/where-does-7-come-from-when-it-comes-to-long-term-stock-returns/) after inflation, though it varies significantly year to year.  your money doubles every 12 years, and goes up by 10x in 40 years.  (all numbers are  after taking inflation into account.)  so that $5000 you put aside at 22 could easily be worth $50,000 of today's dollars at 65.  (but, there could be years where you temporarily lose 10%, 20%, even 30%(http://www.finra.org/investors/reality-investment-risk) of your savings.  do not panic!  it will come back eventually.)  big idea 3 is: invest early and often for your future, especially your retirement.  

got the the big ideas now?   good!  let's see how we combine them for some meaningful benefits for your ~22-year-old self.

- retirement contributions. you are going to retire someday.  invest and perhaps reduce current taxes by letting your employer contribute a percent of each paycheck to your 401k account(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k) (or similar things with different names for government employers).  a recommended investment percentage is 10%, but it's up to you; more is better, the annual maximum is $18,000.  the cardinal rule is take the match(https://www.smart401k.com/resource-center/retirement-investing-basics/company-match) if you have one.  a typical employer adds 3% of your salary when you contribute 6%, so that's like free money.  take the match.  (your actual match depends on your employer's rules.) the  money is invested for you, available penalty-free when you retire after age 59.5 (usually.)  if you change jobs, the money can go  with you.  a 401k can only invest in what your employer offers.   most employers have target date funds, so choosing one is an easy decision.  if you need or want to, you can sometimes achieve an  even better result by picking other available choices.

- ""what do you mean 'perhaps reduce current taxes'?""  retirement savings are wery wery complicated.  (thank your  congresspeople.) a ""traditional"" 401k reduces your current taxes because it exempts your contributions from your taxable income.  you pay taxes when you take the money out, deferring the taxes, but you still pay something.  if you would prefer, you can reverse this if your employer offers a ""roth"" option.  in that case, you pax taxes on your 401k contributions , but no taxes when you take the money out.  the best choice(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) is complex; for those below the 25% bracket, roth is usually better.  

- yet more retirement options: iras.  individual retirement accounts(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/iras) are do-it-yourself 401ks.  you set up an account with a company like vanguard, schwab or fidelity, and give them up to $5500 annually to invest for you.   you have more investment choices, target date funds plus other options.   depending on your income level and whether you have an employer 401k, you open a traditional or roth ira, with tax treatment equivalent to the previously described 401k types.  iras are your go-to option if you have no employer 401k, but you still may (and even should) want to use an ira, especially a roth ira, even if you have one.  you can  tap ira and  401k resources before retirement for certain allowable reasons, though it's not usually recommended because you lose future gains and might owe current taxes.  a roth ira is the best choice for raidable retirement savings because contributions can be taken out at any time without taxes or penalties.

ok.  that was a lot of information!  ready to repay student loans(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans)?  let's find out:  

-  if you do have student loans, the interest rate clock is ticking.  loans are typically 10 year repayment, so you'll owe about 1% of the loan balance each month for ten years.   
if you owe $20,000, that's $200/month.  like a car payment.  not terrible.   
if you owe $100,000, that will be $1000/month.  like a mortgage payment, only without the house.  not fun to pay.  
you have to pay these back unless you get them forgiven.  you have several approaches(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans) available for repayment:

- pay them back on schedule.  it sounds crazy, but it just might work!   if your income supports it, pay the minimum on low-interest (<~4%) loans.  if you have even more income, repay them faster with extra payments, especially on higher interest loans,  and save by paying less interest than you would over time.  this is your primary option on private loans.   if you have high-interest private loans, look into refinancing(https://studentloanhero.com/refinance-and-consolidate-student-loans-0042/) them; if you have good income and credit, you'll qualify for lower interest rates.  

- if you have a lot of federal loans but  little income, look into reduced payment plans(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/understand/plans/income-driven) like income-based repayment (ibr) and pay-as-you-earn (paye) plans.  you'll pay less (even nothing) each month, based on your current income, but you'll pay longer, and ultimately pay more over time in many cases.  

- if you are really in a deep hole, maybe over $100k federal with only $40k annual income, give a special look into public service loan forgiveness(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service) (pslf).  this program allows you to work for ten years in public service, make minimal payments, then your unpaid balance is magically forgiven, which is a really sweet deal if you can get it.  (this differs from forgiveness programs for ibr/paye that will charge you taxes on any amount forgiven in the future.)

enough about  student loans.  let's wrap up with a few other topics of general interest to 22 year olds:

- grad school can be a good idea, but can also be a very expensive idea.  if you are sure this is for you, try to get someone else to pay for it, whether the school via scholarships / stipends, or your employer, if they do education reimbursement.  med school is worth the money no matter who pays.   law school and mba return on investment is iffier these days.  going to grad school because you are not sure what else to do is probably a big mistake, especially so if you have to pay for it.

- you may be responsible for your health insurance(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance).  (you could be on your parents' plan until age 26 in many cases, though that may cost them something.) if your employer will pay for it, that's your best option.  they may offer a lower-premium high deductible health plan(http://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-insurance/articles/2014/11/10/should-you-roll-the-dice-on-a-high-deductible-health-plan) (hdhp), where you pay routine costs, but insurance kicks in for major expenses.  this is a good choice if you have good health and make few claims.  you  should take advantage of a healthcare savings account(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/health/what-is-an-hsa/) (hsa) with an hdhp.  this lets you deduct contributions to pay for out-of-pocket medical expenses, with  other unique features that make them attractive.  you can contribute $3350 annually to your hsa.  some employers pay some of this for you as more free money.   

- if your employer doesn't offer health insurance and you can't use your parents' plan, you'll want to get an individual plan such as those found on healthcare.gov(http://healthcare.gov).  you can only sign up at certain times, including open enrollment  in november / december.  if you don't have health insurance of some form, you could pay a penalty(https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/) of up to ~$2000 at tax time, unless you have an exemption(https://www.healthcare.gov/health-coverage-exemptions/exemptions-from-the-fee/).  

- with more income, you can rent a nicer place within the same 30% of takehome guideline.  you may not even want a roommate!  of course, any money you spend on housing is money you don't have for other things.  living with your parents is still a viable option if you want to save, e.g. to pay down student loans.   please make sure you have renter's insurance, it's well worth the small cost.   (note that we assume you are not yet ready to buy a house; you may not yet be sure where you  want to live long-term, have limited work history, or have insufficient down payment.) 

- you can also afford a nicer car, since you have better credit, and  lower insurance rates.  (you don't have to upgrade your car, and you'll save money if you don't.)  paying cash is still an option, but if you qualify for a 2% car loan, consider taking it to free your money for purposes like retirement investments and loan repayments.  a good target price is perhaps $15k, with a $10k loan, which works out to 4 years at $220/month.  your total cost-of-car would be about $5k annually.  selling your old car privately should get you 20% more than you would by trading it in to a dealer.  

- with more expenses, budgeting becomes much more important.  you'll want to have a bigger emergency fund; we recommend at least three months' expenses, to cover that bad day when you lose your job and your car breaks.   with more expenses to track, look into a program like you need a budget(https://www.youneedabudget.com/) (ynab) or mint(https://www.mint.com/) to help keep track of where your money is, and where it needs to be in the future.  look for ways to economize where you can, whether by cheaper cell-phone plans, learning to cook so you want to eat at home, or taking advantage of employee discounts.  

- while you don't have a lot of tax deductions yet outside of retirement / hsa savings, take a look at possible tax breaks(http://blogs.hrblock.com/2013/04/08/twenty-somethings-dont-overlook-these-tax-deductions/) for student loan interest, moving expenses associated with a job change, and certain tuition expenses (american opportunity tax credit(https://www.irs.gov/individuals/aotc)).  you don't have to itemize to take advantage of these, but income limits apply in some cases.

"i(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when i was told to look after the family pet.. my siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and i've been of to uni. 

i am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. i've been trying to act like i didn't care but when they were driving to the airport i couldn't stop crying. my mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. last time we went to a family vacation was when i was around 13. i cried so much i had cramps in my abdomen.

i wrote them a message trying to make them understand what i was feeling and that it hurt me alot. i got back that i was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. they said they thought i wanted to be ""free"". i know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions i've tried to hide come through. i've never felt this left out and i feel like i'm not a family member. i'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on holliday.
i feel heartbroken.

my plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to uni and dive into school to forget.

how can i forgive them? has this happened to anyone else?

edit: 



i would have paid for myself. this is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. they brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. they are all there. the whole family. they brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. i would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

i am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. i've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that i need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

i'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and i send all the hugs in the world to you! the feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




edit 30 juli: 

i just wanted to say that i've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" i believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. my mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that i wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

for anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. being away from family is hard and i missed mine alot. being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",7
"(update) found out i was being paid less than entry level employees, what do i do?. hey guys! a couple weeks ago i posted about a situation at work where i was promoted to an admin and clinical position, and found out that i was being paid at least a dollar less than entry level employees. i was making $14/hr while others were making anywhere between $14.50 - $15/hr. i asked for advice, and the post blew up, to the point where i had to delete do to me being careless with personal info. i received a lot of advice to search for another job, negotiate higher than i was asking, and some pm's asking for my name and location and position in the company, which led to me deleting the post.

anyway, i met with the woman in charge of wages for my company, and the talk was very friendly and transparent. she said the person hiring people before me was ignoring protocol and absolutely should not have hired people at that rate. she said our range was significantly lower for hiring and that was a mistake on the previous person's end, since she showed me proof of emails that went on between everyone. 

i listened and acknowledged, and said ""i understand, but where does that leave me?"". originally they offered me a .25 cent raise which would bring me to $14.25, which i quickly countered and explained, calmly, why that wasnt a fair compensation. ""i feel with my qualifications and my value of being the only fully certified employee at my location, i think a .25 cent raise would not be very fair to reflect my role."" 

after 20 minutes, she realized i had never received my mandatory 90 day evaluation for a wage increase, never received raises for certain goals met, and other factors. i received a $1.50 raise to $15.50/hr, and i will be up for review again in april when my annual review comes up, where she said ""with everything you have done, the minimum you will see your wage go up is another $1.50. i would expect to be up to at least $18/hr when your eval is due, most likely more."" i requested that in writing so i'd have it and she happily obliged!

tl:dr - was being paid less than entry level employees, negotiated professionally thanks to advice from the sub, received a raise with another one coming in two months.

edit - forgot to mention, full back pay for the time worked :) also edited our irrelevant company info 

edit 2- im going to acknowledge this because i've been seeing a lot of people saying its a low wage and i should leave. ill admit, its not an ideal wage, however, the overall career benefit towards a higher wage and career is well worth it. they pay for graduate school in full, which benefits me as it is a top university they are affiliated with for my career path. they offer a lot of benefits most companies similar to mine do not offer or offer at a high cost to the employee. im well aware i could be making more, but something people on here forget sometimes is, life satisfaction. im happy where i am, and yes the wage isn't perfect, but i love what i do and i wake up every day excited to work, not dread it. i do look at it as a paycheck, but i am not unhappy. 

edit 3- didn't realize this would generate hate. well i'll break down even more: whether hr is screwing me with this new wage is honestly whatever you guys think. in my opinion, they took care of me as best they could. this is a position that doesn't require a degree, and hopefully when i receive mine this may, it will go up more in pay. the takeaway from the post was supposed to be that i was able to get a higher wage by being professional and collected. those of you saying to leave a job i'm happy at for money it baffles me. yes, i was unhappy with my pay when i found out, now that's fixed and i'm 100% happy again. it's a shame i have to explain that to reddit, but seriously, being happy and making okay money is perfectly fine for me. because this path and company will allow me to do both if i invest the time now. it's not about making a lot of money right away, it's about learning and perfecting your skills to make more money. i just get lucky enough to have both.

"for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.. throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so i'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when i graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. i remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill i found out the terms and conditions, i can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses i can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so i told my parents that i cant accept the gift as i dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,i also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where i was called ungrateful and that i'm not a nice daughter. so i walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off. 

reflecting back i do think that i might be the asshole but i'm unsure so i've come to you. 

i will accept any judgment",3
"those viral posts asking things like ""your stripper name is your first pet and your mother's maiden name"" are amazingly effective ways to reveal answers to common security questions you may be using elsewhere.. the next time you see a mass post or ""share this on"" message asking for information like this, remember you're sharing important personal information which may be dangerous to share openly with others. there's a good reason why so many of them rely on your funny answer being made up of your mother's maiden name, first pet, favourite teacher or street you grew up on...

always be careful where you're sharing information, consider whether it's really necessary to share it, or consider using incorrect answers - either to the post, or to the security questions themselves (as long as you can remember what you set them to).",8

"by chilling at my friend's place while she wasn't home. my friend jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and i finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  i ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  

i made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  dude was intimidating and i'm a 4'11"" woman so i was immediately scared.  he looked shocked to see me.  i'm looking at his duffel bag and realizing that i surprised some piece of shit burglar! 

i panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  i'm shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  i start screaming at him to get the fuck out and that i'm calling the police (total bluff because i didn't have my phone.)  he then yells back that he is calling the police on me.  this gives me pause.  at this point, i look around and realize the bedroom i'm in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  i ask him through the door if he knows jenna (last name).  he tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  well.  apparently, jenna's neighbor also keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  

so, today i fucked up by letting myself into my friend's neighbor's place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.

"update: for shutting down all black names because i think it'll make my son's life harder?. https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ck2eaj/aita_for_shutting_down_black_names_because_i/

i posted a month ago about a dilemma my husband and i were having with our baby's name. we had already decided on a girl's name because it honors his mother but we're stuck on a boy's name. my husband thought it was important for our son to have a name strongly tied to black american culture. i wanted a more neutral name since i am biracial and grew up with a stereotypical black name. we found out we are having a boy and decided on his name. his name will be....

miles trayvon

we thought it was a perfect compromise. my husband's family tends to use middle names a lot so he'll probably be ""tray"" to most of them. when he's in school his name will just be listed as miles (last name). he can officially be miles t. (last name) if he doesn't want to use trayvon but he can also easily go by trayvon if he feels more connected to that name. this option gives him the choice, which my husband and i agreed was important. my husband hated growing up with a stereotypical white boy name and said it caused some ribbing from people in his community who saw him as being less black. he talked about how in 8 mile eminem's character says something like, ""this guy's a gangsta? his real name is clarence."" that's not to say my husband ever wanted to be a gangsta. he's an actuary lol but he said he felt like his name played a role in further isolating him from his black peers growing up.

i had the opposite experience. my mom is white and my dad is black. they decided on a stereotypical black name and i think it made my life harder. professional i go by a nickname and i do personally as well. when talking about it with my husband i realized it started early. i remember being about 4 and being out with my white grandma. a woman came up to me, touched my hair, told my grandma i was beautiful, and then asked what my name was. instead of saying my real name my grandma said, ""her name is daisy."" i attended an hbcu and finally felt comfortable with my given name but noticed a lot of seniors with black names used shortened versions of their names for job applications. for example, raquan smith would put ""ray smith"", demarcus jones would put ""marcus jones"", keshawnda nelson would put ""shawna nelson"", etc. they said you had to play within the system and i did that.

anyway, sorry for the long update. i just wanted to explain why this was such a big deal to both of us. we didn't really get deep into it until after i posted here so thanks for encouraging that dialogue. before anyone says it, i do realize some people will connect trayvon to trayvon martin. that's not why we are using it. i posted about this in namenerds and a lot of people were upset by it but i don't mean to offend anyone. it's a family name on my husband's side.

edit: thanks for all the dms but please stop sending me articles about the woman named marijuana pepsi and the black spider-man named miles. thanks y'all.",3

"update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. orginal: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c13s1w/wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids_last/

**tl;dr:** wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july. wife got pregnant anyways. it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery. wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating. seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.

update **tl;dr** at bottom

first i just want to thank everyone who reached out and offered their story about similar.  i can't believe how many people are told they're completely sterile and end up being able to have kids anyways.  

i took a lot of what you guys said to heart.  i had an ex of mine from years ago end up cheating on me, and it really left a scar for a while.  it wasn't until i got more involved with sports and getting in better shape that i was able to try and move on.  my wife and i actually met in a soccer league we were in together. we've had so much trust for so long that i thought those fears had gone away.  it wasn't until now that i really started to feel shaken like that again.

but i didn't want to let my past get in the way of what could be just a huge blessing.  a few people really articulated the right way to communicate my feelings in a way that wasn't accusatory and respectful of my wife, who's never really given me a reason to doubt her.

it's not uncommon for her to sometimes be home late, and she'll usually like to go straight to bed. i didn't want to dump this on her immediately and decided to give myself a night to sleep on it.  i got up pretty early just being restless, went for a run, and cleared my mind. i couldn't wait any longer.  i made our favorite omelets, and told her i needed to talk about something.

""you know i'm not ashley, right?""

she knows me well.  ashley's my ex who cheated.

so first i apologized.  i apologized because i let this build up in my head for so long without talking with her about it sooner.  what should be blessing has been nothing but insecurity and fear for me.

we talked for a while.  i told her how happy it made me to see her ecstatic and excited for the baby. i told her how much i loved the relationship that we've built together, and i felt like an asshole for questioning her loyalty.  she had never given me a reason not to trust her and that i still couldn't emotionally get over the thoughts of infidelity because of my ex.  she thanked me for telling her, and she knew how hard it was for me to get over that.  she volunteered to have us get a paternity right when he/she's born, which made me feel a lot better at first.

but something still felt off.  i honestly don't know why, something about how she was so eager to get a paternity test, and almost not mad at me at all for having kept this from her.  normally she would have been upset that i didn't bring it up right away, but there was just a weird feeling i couldn't shake for the rest of the day.

it seemed like she was saying all the right things, but i couldn't get rid of this clawing feeling inside my head.  maybe i'm just being paranoid.  maybe there's a gut feeling that i need to listen to.  but i ended up going to the appointment alone, as we ""decided"" it would good to see if i still needed the surgery.

turns out it's obstructive azoospermia.  i've read so many stories about people who were supposed to infertile end up getting pregnant. so i brought that up, and how my wife's pregnancy was affecting me. the urologist thought it would be pretty unlikely that i wouldn't need surgery to have a kid with how mine was presenting itself. he mainly tried to skirt around the topic, and mostly pushed me towards making sure she was actually pregnant.

being there didn't really help.  i feel like i just got more uncertainty.  

she had another night being out to 8:30 last night.  we talked about scheduling an appointment to verify the pregnancy when she got home. she seemed a little confused, but then quickly agreed. she promised to do it in the morning.  i asked how work had gone, and she gave me a kind of non-commital answer about her boss pushing her too much and being stressed out.  

there's nothing huge there, but she just seemed off.  i really couldn't put my finger on it.  we were still acting all lovely-dovey, but something just felt wrong, and i couldn't talk about it without repeating the same conversation we had sunday.

i've been trying to throw myself into work to distract myself, but i haven't been able to focus.  we have a joint checking account that we'll sometimes move money in and out of, but really only use it for groceries or household items unless we talk about it beforehand.  this morning she moved half of it to hers, about $1700. we don't do that, she's never needed to before.  and i checked our health care portal, and she made the appointment for the one time thursday that i mentioned i was busy working on-site. we were supposed to go together.

i'm starting to go crazy. how do i bring this up that isn't me just having the same conversation again?  i'm looking into getting a second opinion for myself.  but i need a litmus test from objective outsiders to know if i'm really losing it or if this seems weird to someone else.

**tl;dr had good conversation about my ex-cheating before and those issues, something still felt off.  urologist said i had obstructive azoospermia, implied i should ""make sure my wife is pregnant"" and didn't think i could be fertile.  wife is taking money from joint account and booked her doctor appointment when i can't go.  getting a second urology opinion, also slightly going crazy.**

update:  i've been trying to center myself.  we talked calmly for a bit on the phone.  she claimed she moved the money out in anticipation for the deductible payments she'll have with different visits.  i didn't bring up anything else, but she seemed a little impatient with me, probably rightly so, and implied we'd have a longer talk when she gets home.  i'm just trying to not overreact right now. i don't know what to think, this is either a misunderstanding on my side and im a father! or...not.  thankfully she's not working late today.  

thank you those who are trying to keep me grounded.

update:  i went for a long run to clear my mind.  gotta shower, and then my wife should be home.  i'm going to go into the conversation with no judgement, just objectively walk out the facts and why i've still been struggling personally with some of them.  regardless of what happens i'm done with any confusion left between us.

  thanks to those who messaged me and gave advice.

"what to do if you've been kicked out of your family home as a teenager: a pf guide. unfortunately, posts on this topic are not a rare occurrence here. teenagers are often kicked out of their home without support, sufficient money, or time to prepare in advance, but there are some resources and options for teenagers in this situation.

this guide also includes some information for teenagers who are at risk of being kicked out.

# first, please seek help

if you need help, there are confidential and nonjudgmental services with trained helpers that you can call or contact online. sometimes these services get busy. if you can't reach someone right away, please try again until you reach someone.

in the case of a life-threatening emergency, please call the police or the emergency telephone number for your country (e.g., 911 in the united states).

in addition to the below resources, consider talking to an adult that you trust and/or an independent institution or service provider with community knowledge and resources. there are many options such as:

- a teacher, sports coach, or staff member at your school

- a school guidance counselor, school nurse, or doctor

- a relative that you trust

- a family doctor or nurse

- a religious leader

- a librarian

  while most are not trained explicitly in this area, librarians tend to be resourceful and very good at research if you're feeling overwhelmed.

- a staff member at local shelters, food banks, soup kitchens, etc.

  even if you aren't interested in that specific resource, they tend to be sympathetic and familiar with local resources.

- another adult you trust

  it doesn't have to be one of the above options. someone like a friend's parent or even a neighbor may be a good option for getting advice, sorting through your options, and avoiding mistakes. most adults have a decent amount of experience dealing with government agencies, navigating complex situations, and have had their share of troubles too.

# some housing options to consider

read through all of these before you settle on which options to try first. if it starts to be too overwhelming or you need help, please reach out to one or more of the resources listed above for advice and support.

1. **if your home living situation was not abusive** and there is an option to make up with your parent(s) or caregiver, please consider it (even if it means a curfew, chores and hard work, or following rules you don't like). you can use this time to save up more money, find work, finish high school, and generally prepare for living on your own.

   if things are uncomfortable at home and you're allowed to simply spend more time elsewhere, that's often a good option to reduce tension at home. some ideas: get a cheap gym membership, do your studying at the library, get a part-time job, join an after-school group, or volunteer.

   if you have fundamental disagreements with your family or caregivers and this would be a possible reason for you to be kicked out, it's probably best to delay announcing these until you're on your own and doing well independently. maybe they are not great people. maybe you don't believe in the same things. as long as you are safe, it can wait until you are in a better position to be independent. as they say, the best revenge is living a good life.

2. it's generally illegal for your parent(s) or guardian to actually kick you out. **if your home living situation was not abusive**, one option to consider is contacting the police to get back into your home.
    - if you're an underage child (under 18 in most of the united states) and not legally emancipated, it's almost always illegal for parent(s) or a guardian to kick you out.
    - even if you're an adult or legally emancipated, but living at home, it's generally illegal to kick you out without following the relevant laws including sufficient notice. the specifics depend on the circumstances and your location (you may consider posting to /r/legaladvice as well).

  contacting the police may be unpleasant and you will need to listen to the police officer, but your parent(s) or guardian will also need to listen and allow you back into their home. you shouldn't be carrying anything illegal (drugs, alcohol if you're underage, or illegal weapons) in general regardless, but absolutely do not have any of those items on you or in your room if you contact the police.

3. if you have any relatives that you can reach that would let you stay with them for any period of time, this is one of the best available options if you've been kicked out. aunt or uncle lives in the next state? call them and find a way to get there. any non-abusive relative that you know is probably a better option than heading to a shelter. grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, step-siblings, you name it.

4. failing that, your next best bet is to contact friends, crash on a couch, and ask anyone you know that might put up with you. try to consider *any* workable and safe options. for example, your ex's parents liked you and you're on good terms? call them and ask if you can sleep on their couch for a few days until you figure something out.

5. while you're living on someone else's dime, in a place that isn't yours, friends, family, shelter, whatever it is, try you best to be on your best behavior.  that means:
 - try to avoid drugs and alcohol. if you need help with substance abuse, please reach out to some of the resources linked above.
 - try to respect any rules of the household or establishment and stay out of trouble.
 - keep your space clean and maintain your personal hygiene.
 - try to avoid being a negative presence.

6. it may be very difficult to find a better option, especially on short notice, but living and sleeping on the street is very dangerous, especially as a teenager. **contact one of the above help lines and they will help you find a safe place to sleep.**

## united states

if you're 16 to 24, job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov) is another option worth investigating (some adults with documented disabilities above the age of 24 are also accepted). under the age of 18, you will need the approval of a parent or guardian.

job corps offers free education and vocational training, dormitory-style housing, food, work clothes, and other resources to help prepare youth for independent living and the opportunity to learn skills needed for a job that's somewhat better than an unskilled minimum-wage job. it's completely free for those that qualify and are accepted into the program.

# preparing if you think you might be kicked out or may need to leave soon

1. try to avoid accelerating the process and use any time you have to save up money and prepare. your own safety comes first, though.

2. try to make sure you will have a place to stay. if you can sleep on a couch for a month and save up more money before renting a room, do it. you want to save up money as much as reasonably possible.

3. try to have your birth certificate, identification, passport, diplomas and anything else you will need. store important documents at the home of a trusted friend or family member if possible. note that your parent(s) or guardian aren't obligated to give you their copy of certain documents and you should not put yourself at risk to retrieve these because you can order a copy later (link for united states(https://www.usa.gov/replace-vital-documents)).

4. plan for the worst case even though it might not happen. your parents may not support you going to school, fill out financial aid paperwork for you, etc. if you can't afford to pay for school on your own, you may need a different plan for continuing your education such as going to community college while working.

5. if and when you need to spend money for a place to stay, try to spend as little money as possible on rent. that usually means renting a room instead of an apartment, having some roommates, etc.

# financial accounts

- joint bank accounts can be emptied by either account holder at any time so if you're old enough to open your own bank account (18 or 19 in the united states), open a new bank account *at a different bank* from the one used by your family. local credit unions, online banks, and online credit unions are popular recommendations here. use a local credit union if you will need to deposit cash.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/banks_and_credit_unions)

- if you're not old enough to open an account where you live, see if an adult that you trust will help open a joint bank account with you. when you are old enough to open your own account, open one as soon as possible and transfer your money over.

- sign up for electronic statements and consider using a different postal address (e.g., the address of a friend or trusted adult) so statements don't get delivered to your home.

- if you're having trouble finding an bank or credit union that will allow an adult that isn't a parent or guardian to open an account with you, the money account(https://www.capitalone.com/bank/checking-accounts/teen-checking-account/) offered by capital one 360 is one option in the united states.

- check your credit report(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/ad5f5h/30day_challenge_1_get_on_top_of_your_credit/) and freeze your credit(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/identity_theft) (sign up for credit monitoring before freezing your credit).

# school

## united states

if you're still in high school, ask a guidance counselor or principal at your school about continuing your education. the mckinney-vento act is a federal law that mandates the right of students regardless of their housing status. the law provides resources and support including provide transportation, free meals, and other services.

if you have questions about federal student aid, and are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless read this guide from the department of education(https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/sites/default/files/homeless-youth.pdf).

"if your first language is english, you have no excuse for not being able to distinguish between ""there"", ""their"", and ""they're"".. the same goes for ""your"" vs. ""you're"" (and also ""two"", ""too"", and ""to""). these words are so commonplace that getting them wrong is just lazy. 

i feel like telling people (politely) when they've used them incorrectly is the right thing to do, and saying ""language is fluid"" isn't appropriate for such a serious mistake. i think it's fine to ignore minor mistakes with punctuation and spelling, but using the wrong ""there"" actually changes the meaning of a sentence (often to nonsense), since the *wrong word* is being used. 

i've seen a weird trend of people proudly not knowing the difference between these words, and it just feels like they're patting themselves on the back for not understanding something that takes less than five minutes to learn. it's embarrassing and it honestly makes people look stupid.",6

came with a couple of friends for the weekend to amsterdam for a birthday. it's a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. 

i'm sure most people know the dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit 'coffee shops' and buy and smoke joints. 

had a fun party night last night in town. went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. 

in a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, i put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...'did i ditch that joint'?

at this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. 

'sir, do you have anything in your pockets' says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. 

holy. fucking. shit. what to do? i'm still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. do i come clean? no way-too late for that. got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. 

go to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. but, schiphol airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. i'm asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. i'm sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did i smoke that joint??? airport guys hands pats pocket. i feel object being pressed into hip. fuck fuck fuck. 

'sir, empty your pocket please'? says airport guy. my partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. in slow motion i see the penny drop on his face. i dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. i feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. 

i'm dying inside. i say to pat down guy, 'oh god. i'm really sorry, i forgot that was in th...'
'haha, sure, sure - thats what they all say'! laughs airport pat down guy loudly. 

i'm placed to one side. customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. 

customs man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, 'don't worry sir! don't look so scared! you are 20th today and you won't be last! i'm sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately i can't let you leave amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home'. 

i almost wept with relief. i was made to sign a form to say he'd taken joint off me....and that was it...

i'm in a bar in schiphol airport in amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. to all you dutch-bless your hearts. you're the best. i'm sorry i was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.

tldr i was a hot mess and genuinely forgot i had a joint in my pocket. got caught with it. dutch customs were amazing about it. 

edit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)

edit 2, thanks for the shiny stuff. first awards (on a story about my drug use).  i'm from uk for those asking.. my flights just landed and i made it through uk customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. i've just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. it says under what was taken, 'joints'. 

edit 3-schiphol doesn't frisk as matter of routine, yes i get it. thanks for correction.",4
"my boyfriend (19m) has been bullying me online. i feel sick to my stomach. this is obviously an alt, but on my real account, i post pictures on a few makeup subs. i get nice comments but i always get rude messages about how my makeup is looking disgusting and i'm ugly and makeup can't help an ugly face. that i should kill my self and looking at my photo made them wanna throw up. i even got some scary messages saying they knew where i lived and they sent me my full name and birthday and college i go to. that was really terrifying. every comment of mine was also downvoted. someone was doing this to me and it really hurt my feelings. i tried not to take it personally because i thought they didn't even know anything about me. i tried deleting and making new accounts but they always found me.  

well my boyfriend was asleep and i saw the reddit app so i wanted to see his profile so i could stalk him. i found his real account and i found a couple other accounts too. he was sending me the messages and down voting everything i'd post. i feel so horrified. i've gone to him so many times crying about these messages, especially the ones saying they knew my personal info and telling me they vomited after seeing my photos. he'd comfort me and all that. i feel so scared. i don't know what to do

"my favorite joke: everyone knows dave. dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""you know, i know everyone there is to know. just name someone, anyone, and i know them.""

tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""ok, dave, how about tom cruise?""

""no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it.""
so dave and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,

 ""dave! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!""

although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.

""no, no, just name anyone else,"" dave says.

""president obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""yup,"" dave says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go. 

at the white house, obama spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""pope francis,"" his boss replies.

""sure!"" says dave. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.

dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope.""
he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.

sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, ""what happened?""

his boss looks up and says, ""it was the final straw... you and the pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with dave?'",0

christmas eve comes around, the boy sits at the dinner table and doesn't say a word. after a while his girlfriend says: ""if i had known you were so quiet, i wouldn't have invited you."" the young man replies ""if you had told me your dad works at a drug store, i wouldn't have come.""

"for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though i don't need it?. i hate flying to the point that i will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. it's not that i'm scared of flying, i just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

so i only fly if i can buy a second seat (or third if i'm flying with my wife). it lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class and for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. i'm a big guy but i 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

on multiple flights i've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no i bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? if i was willing to fly with one seat i wouldn't have bought a second seat.

note - i do not take two seats on the train/bus ever. they are way more comfortable and you can stand whenever etc so i don't feel cramped and trapped like on a plane.",3

"for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.. for the last year i've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


about a week ago i went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if i wanted a receipt. at this point i figured i had just used a deal i don't know about, but the next time i went the same thing happened. so the next several times i've gone i've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


i'm thinking something is wrong and i should tell someone, but i kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. aita?

update: hi guys

i thought i had the golden ticket, i really did. 

i thought i had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. the rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. last night i dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


i wanted to ask you fine people if i was the asshole real quick before i went balls deep and pilfered my way through a midwest convenience store chain. i'll be honest i didn't care what people said though. i was high on the fact that i had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


after i made the post i made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""i mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


i made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause i was sleepy. and then i went to perform the maneuver. i strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

it was a gift card. 


i had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, i found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

i'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" but i sucked it up and paid, and now all i have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend. in the morning i sent her a few messages saying ""what time should i pick you up"" and such, all of which went ignored. i decided to just pretend that she was asleep and i went without her. when i arrived i just made a joke saying ""i think she's still asleep"", she hasn't replied to any of my messages. at about 12:45 i got a string of messages asking where i was and what's going on. i just played dumb and said ""wait, you're ready? i thought you were still in bed or something??""

i knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but i didn't want to play this stupid game and i don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so i just decided to not pick her up.

"in a lot of children's shows like peppa pig the fathers are consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots and the mothers as awesome heroines saving the day and it sends a very wrong message to little kids. like in virtually every show aimed towards little kids, the girls are heroic, the boys foolish. the girls save the day. i don't mind that the girls save the day, every once in a while, but for them to *always* do it and the male characters to *always* lag behind is a pity. like there's barbie movies too in which barbie saves the day and is portrayed as competent and heroic, whereas ken is a borderline idiot who kisses the ground she walks on and always gets in trouble. a lot of kids shows are like this. the father figures are weak, the mother figures all-knowing. 

in peppa pig, specifically, the father of peppa is an engineer. he has blue prints lying around the house and everything, has an office, works hard, is a pillar of the community, and yet he's constantly made fun of and used as the butt of jokes because he's a bit fat. it's kinda lame and gives a terrible example. meanwhile ""mommy pig"" is awesome and pretty much flawless. the whole thing is pretty insidious.

"for starting my wedding on time and not waiting for my parents?. i got married on saturday, and it was absolutely amazing except for one thing: my parents showed up late. they knew the ceremony time, and my husband and i made it very clear to everyone, both in the invites and in person, that we were going to start exactly at that time. the venue cost us a lot of money (we paid for the entire wedding ourselves) and we were only able to use it for a limited amount of time, so we wanted to make every minute count.

my parents showed up 15 minutes later and missed the entire ceremony. it turns out they did leave early but got rear-ended at a traffic light and had to deal with insurance, police, etc. they only have a landline, no cellphones, so they couldn't get in touch with me. obviously there's no way i could have known this.

"by telling my son's new doctor we are anti-vaxx. obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.

my son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. we decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. i brought my son in for a standard ""well child"" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.

toward the end of the visit she says to me, ""well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,"" to which i reply, ""oh, no he can't have that, i don't want him to get autism.""

i should maybe note here that i am an aspie too, and while i think my sarcasm is on point, i must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. the silence lasted an eternity while i imagine she was deciding how to proceed. eventually i laughed and tried to assure her i was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.

as my son and i were discussing whether i was offensive (he thought i was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. he started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. he just kept saying, ""okay, well i have to tell you this,"" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel.

i was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. my aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. i explained why exactly i didn't feel good about giving her leyla's social security number. they both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

after explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. we ended up working out a compromise - my wife and i opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. everything seemed to have worked out well.

"i (m28) broke up with my ex-fiancee (f27) of 4 years 2 weeks ago after catching her in a huge lie and then finding out 3 days ago that she commited suicide because i wouldn't take her back. i am in need of some serious advice as i'm being blamed for everything.. hey guys,

i need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?

a little background: 

me and my ex-fiancee had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. i was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. she was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.

back in april of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. i once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.

it all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in june because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. that was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving. i didn't hear from her for almost a week, none of her friends knew where she was and heck none of her folks even knew what was going on until she finally contacted me and wanted to talk.

imagine my surprise when she confessed to me that there was another guy involved and how all this time she was hanging out with him when all this time she was lying to me about hanging with her friends. i fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. it made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.

heck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.

everything was kinda ok until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message ""sorry bro"" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. the picture was of my ex-fiancee at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. i fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. she was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.

when i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.

she cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. i was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.

i told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. she begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.

i did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fiancee had comitted suicide. her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.

i am at a fucking lose, ex-fiancee friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. 

i am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",7

"update: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke with her after she decided to keep the baby.. original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/?utm_source=reddit-android

i'll post the update first, since there has been some change since i last posted. then i'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of pms i received.

yesterday, i received a call from my gf. she was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. i told her that i still care for her, and that i'll obviously listen to what she has to say.

she told me that a few days after i told her we were done, she called up her mother to talk about this. apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that i was actually manipulating her to do so. her mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter. 

after i left her, my gf called her mum up to talk about what went on. my gf said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. my gf said she broke down on the phone, and her mother kept asking her what she will do. the conversation then ended when my gf said she didn't know.

then she started texting. after a few hours of thinking, my gf sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. she was then blocked.

my gf then called me, and told me everything.

she will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.

i discussed this with my gf, and we both completely agreed that i had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that i put my foot down, because had i not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (her words, not mine)

she further went on to say that i am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a mum, if she had me, she could get through this. i broke down at this point.

i love her so much. in truth, i probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though i knew i'd resent it. i made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if i had made the right decision.

i'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have. 

also, screw any mother who places religion over their own child. friggin lunatics.


now to respond to some of your points from the last thread:

1: no. my gf did not cheat on me. i am almost certain about this. not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. moreover, her roommate took photos of my gf after she came home assaulted. it's not ""rough sex"" as some of you dicks put it.

2: i don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my gfs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.

3: my gf was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the mum).

4: thanks for all the people telling me i did the right thing. it was really difficult. i'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.

5: to the people who pm'd me telling me i'm a monstrous baby killer - i fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.

"by trying to buy an instant pot at target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist. this started yesterday but i didn't realize my fu until today.

yesterday, i stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt instant pot at target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. i decided i would get some christmas shopping done early and flip a few. i ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. i go to target and give them my id, they look it up and can't find it at first. i give them the order number and i hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. the one says he has to let the manager know i'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but i didn't think much of it.

fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. the doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. i step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the state police counter terrorism unit and they start questioning me about why i'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if i know what they can be used for, if i'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the target parking lot. i did my best to explain the price mistake and how i found it, etc. i think they accepted my explanation but i'm still nervous that i'm on a watchlist now.

tl:dr tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 instant pots at target, got interrogated by state police counter terrorism unit why i was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

"bank of america is refusing to give back $9,800 to my dad's account after someone fraudulently stole his funds.. on the night of november 1st/early morning of november 2nd, someone made 8 separate withdrawals of $600 each(total $4800) at atm machines in tarrytown, white plains, and lower manhattan from my dad's account and then phone transferred another $5000 from his savings account to his checking account. then the thief made three purchases at target with a debit card, charging $1000, $2000, and $2000 respectively. the total amount that was taken out of my father's account was $9,800.

when he checked his email on november 4th, my father immediately called bank of america and notified them of the fraud and filed two claims (one for the saving and one for the checking accounts).

after waiting several business days for the result of the investigation, my father called bofa to check on the status of the claim and was told the claims could not be paid because they did not see any errors on their part with their system! they reopened the claim but then closed it again several days later.
i don't understand how the bank can deny responsibility. my dad has never told anyone the pin number for his debit card(not even members of his own family). when you put money in a bank, it is suppose to be safe and now he feels violated because not only was this money stolen from him, but now they are trying to say that they are not at fault.

he was informed by a bofa associate that someone had called in requesting a new debit card on oct. 27, 2016, but he did not make a call to bofa on that date. i don't understand why the bank would allow this unusual activity to go through, or how they could let a thief phone transfer his money between his savings and checking accounts! also, how can the bank authorize a new debit card to be mailed and what exactly is required for this request to be granted? he did not make the call to request a new debit card! where are the security checks in place for any of this?
my father filed a police report and the detectives assured him at that time that the bank would return the cash. they said that as long as the fraud is reported within 60 days, the bank has an obligation to return the funds.

the last time he spoke with a bofa manager in a local branch, they actually reassured him that he would be getting his money back and that the process just takes time.

but this is the letter that my father received from bofa today:

we've completed our investigation of your above referenced claim and based on our findings, we're unable to honor the claim
because the transfer was made to an account that you own and the funds were made available to you for personal use, used to
pay an obligation owed by you, or both. as a result, we're respectfully denying your claim.

fraud and claims


at this point, what should he be doing? contacting the local news? getting a lawyer and suing bofa? i asked him to mail a certified letter with return receipt to bofa so that there is a paper trail of all of this.

according to the ftc, he should be fully covered.

edit:  thank you all for your replies and comments.  i will do research into what federal agencies to file complaint at and i will keep everyone updated on any additional details.  in the meantime, i will try to answer some of the questions that were posed:

1) the thief called bofa and requested a new atm/debit card on october 27th and it was mailed to my parent's home address.  i believe that whoever called bofa to request the card also stole it from the mail.  my mom's account at bofa was not compromised but my parents were very upset and did not want to take any chances, so they requested replacement cards for both their accounts (their accounts are not linked) after the incident. 
bofa mailed my dad's debit/atm card and pin on separate days as requested, but my mom's new debit/atm card and pin still arrived in the mail on the same day.  i am guessing that this is how the thief was able to get ahold of the card/pin.  

2) a lot of people are asking why the withdrawal limit was so high.  my dad received a letter in the mail a few days after the fraud occurred letting them know that their withdrawal limit was increased to $2400.  apparently, the thief called in and requested to increase the daily limit.  they then made 4x$600 withdrawals right before midnight on november 1st, and 4x$600 withdrawals in the early morning of november 2nd.  by the time my dad got the notice that his withdrawal limit had been increased, his money was already long gone.

3) i have no idea why the thief had to do a phone transfer to move the remaining 5k from the savings account to the checking account.  i would think that you could do a transfer right at the atm. i think there should be a recording of all of these various phone transactions and bofa frankly does not care to look into them.  they also don't care to look at the videos from the atms.  

edit#2: update
great news!  bank of america has returned the money to my dad's bank account.  he received an email to log into his bofa account to check some new messages.  after he logged in, he saw that his funds had been returned and the messages stated that his subsequent follow up claims had been approved.

the next step is to find out from bofa and exactly what information the perpetrator had that allowed them to request a new debit card from bofa to be mailed to my dad's address.  i saw a lot of comments that asked why my dad didn't file a police report, but he did!  i realize that the first post was a huge block of text, but i did mention that he filed a police report. it's just buried in that text.  a lot of people also mentioned that it might be someone close to him such a a family member, but this is pretty much impossible.  my mom and dad immigrated to the us over 30 years ago, so we actually don't have any other family members here, as the rest of the extended family is overseas.  i'm their only child and i live on the west coast while they still live in ny.  i also doubt that they fell into bad company because they are some of the most straight laced boring people you'll ever meet, lol.  they don't drink, gamble, smoke, etc. in any case, the next step is definitely to figure out how this happened in the first place. hopefully bofa will be able to provide us more information in that regards.",10
"by attempting suicide without realizing it. so, as i was making myself breakfast this morning, i for some reason started wondering what would happen if i touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. being the very intelligent man i am, i of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. i instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. a small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

the worst part is, i still didn't realize what i had actually just done. i just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. as i grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that i had almost electrocuted myself. maybe i was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. if i had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, i would have gotten an electric shock.

i haven't told anyone yet, and i don't think i will.

"i'm a guy and i wish i could be pregnant. i think pregnancy is wonderful. i know it's not all lollipops and rainbows. i supported my wife every single day through her pregnancy and i helped her through the nausea, the body aches, and the terrible pain of giving birth. i know there are risks and complications and it's not something everyone wants to do. i wish i could do it, though.


my wife and i agreed we wanted a baby as soon as we had a house. thankfully, she was able to become pregnant (i really feel for the women who can't have babies and wish they could) and we now have a toddler who is an absolute joy.


she loved being pregnant. every day we talked about the baby growing in her womb that we couldn't wait to meet. i kissed her belly hundreds of times. and i fell in love with her all over again every time i looked at her. her hand was pretty much glued to her belly, always rubbing it and humming a song. the bond that is formed between the mother and child is simply beautiful.


the hardest part about it is that i'll never be able to realize this wish and i never had a choice in the matter. women can choose (in most cases) whether or not they want to become pregnant. and i don't know how the logistics of it all would work, anyway. maybe if we lived in a world where both men and women were built with the capability to have babies, kind of like seahorses. i know it's not realistic, but if it were possible to give me a uterus transplant i'd consider it. i would go through considerable pain and effort if it meant i could get pregnant.


every guy i've ever told has either looked at me like i'm insane or just straight-up laughed at me. women i've told seem to understand, but nobody really takes it seriously except for my wife. she knows it's not a joke and that it's an actual dream of mine. any guys out there agree with me?


edit: some people are rightfully pointing out that my wife's pregnancy went smoothly and that we are very fortunate. i do not disagree. however, i disagree that i have an idealized view of pregnancy. just because things went well for her does not mean they would for me and does not mean they go well for others, but it also does not invalidate my feelings. as i stated above, i am well-informed of the risks that come with pregnancy.

edit 2: no, it's not a sexual thing. also, to clarify, i am happy as a straight male and i do not want to transition to become a woman.",6

""over the years, i've often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering i've learned a good deal about human behavior. my regular recommendation has been a low-cost s&p 500 index fund. to their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.

i believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when i've given it to them. instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.""

...

""over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. protege funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. buffett had made his point. when looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. and when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.""",10

"update girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. i don't. what are my rights? (texas). this is my first post.(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice) 

short version: i'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

long version:

if you remember, i asked about how i should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. i listened to the suggestions. got a lawyer. put myself on the registry as well.

she really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. i was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. but in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. so we had no messy legal right over it.

the childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. my lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

so i have my baby daughter!

taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. i feel like i have something to live for! my family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. i also got a promotion at work. i realized that i need to be more ambitious because i now have a baby to provide for. a higher position was open at my work and i asked for the promotion but they told me i'm too young. i offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that i can do it. after a month they gave me the job! 

as most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), i had my lawyer file for child support after i had full custody. my ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. she actually called me names and various insults and all of that. but i didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. she said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. i don't know. i didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but i think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. i didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, i'm not good at studying) but i want to make sure my daughter has the chance! my sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and i think i'll send most of the child support payments there once i start receiving them.

"by being too horny to notice something had gone horribly wrong. nsfw. well, this didn't happen today. but it's a funny story that i couldn't share with reddit at the time.

rewind back to me at 14 years old. awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. 

as such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing ""boobs"" and ""butts in thongs"" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. 

one night, to avoid watching tv with my dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, i claimed that i had ""homework"" to do. of course, this was a lie. i just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. 

so i fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.

now this is where things went wrong. i got horny and forgot the layout of my house.

you see, my bedroom was upstairs and i had no door. a sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my dad, his wife, and her two kids were watching tv. 

the desktop was right next to the staircase, but i figured that the tv was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. i was right.

but what i didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. 

i also didn't register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. 

i eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.

and that's when i turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that i was casting a giant shadow puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. a perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. and i had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.

so i did what anyone would do in that situation. i put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until i heard the tv come back on. then i went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. 

no one ever brought it up. and i'm thankful. but i know what they saw. and i'm still cringing.

tl;dr: got horny. got stupid. projected a masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. still embarrassed.

"i was arrested, kept in jail for 62 days and then released after the da finally got around to my case. i did nothing wrong.. okay, so a few days ago i was released from county jail after being held for 62 days. i lost my job, didn't pay rent for 2 months almost 3 now and my car is in the process of being put up for auction and they won't release it.

i was arrested for felon in possession of a firearm (i'm not a felon and never have been or had anything expunged and at the time of arrest i didn't even have a firearm on me) and reckless endangerment (firing a weapon at the side of a building, again something i did not do). i had an initial appearance thing in the jail over video where i was given a public defender who was completely and absolutely useless. i'm not sure if this is the norm for public defenders but he didn't say anything i told him to at this appearance i had because a simple background check shows i don't have a felony and on the night this all allegedly happened i was out of state (plane tickets and hotel with work). he literally just said not guilty then asked for a signature bond (judge or magistrate guy denied it because felon with a firearm is a huge thing).

so then i sat, in jail for a total of 60 days before my public defender even came to see me. i tried to call him everyday with the phones and the number on the paper i had but he was never in and never came to see me. i couldn't afford a regular attorney who wanted around $2500 to even start a criminal case. i don't really have family or super close friends to call for help, i was fired from work obviously and now late on rent and will be evicted probably because i can't pay without a job and definitely not $2100+ utilities for rent on the 3 months i'm about to owe.

when he finally came and seen me 2 days before my next appearance and he finally listened to me he talked to the da who apparently also had not looked at my case or my letter i mailed them until then also. after that appearance i got a ""sorry, computer error you are free to go"" and i was released.

what can i do for any of this? apparently someone with the same name but a different dob shot a building after a fight and is a felon but i sat in jail, lost my job, can't even get my car back they say unless i pay some crazy fees (how am i liable for these fees if it was a error?!). this is in madison, wisconsin

i'm sitting there, doing my sit-down-business because boss makes a dollar, i make a dime. i've just finished the dirty work and i'm about to perform my ablutions, but i delay it because it's a ""paid to shit"" thing, dicking around on reddit a bit. at this point i feel something jump onto my balls. something i had never hoped i would ever experience, let alone talk about on the internet.

&#x200b;

i shriek. not a barbarian shriek. not a viking shriek. psycho-shower-scene shriek.

&#x200b;

a huntsman spider has crawled out of the toilet bowl and jumped onto my low hanging fruit.

&#x200b;

i bat the spider off, smacking myself in the nuts, keel over in pain.

&#x200b;

spider dead. good news.

&#x200b;

my banshee wail has not gone unanswered. bad news.

&#x200b;

someone comes into the bathroom and knocks on the stall door. ""mate are you alright? have you fallen over? i'll call an ambulance.""

&#x200b;

""no. fine. everything. is. good. just slipped. fine. no need to call an ambulance. you can leave now.""

i flush the world's smallest sexual predator to try and retain some of my inner pride, wash my hands, and make the very very long walk back to my desk.

my manager's desk isn't too far from the bathrooms, and he comes up to me afterwards.

&#x200b;

""what happened in there, is everyone alright?""

&#x200b;

""yeah... everyone's... fine.""

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

and then i make the dumbest deciscion of my life, and explain to him what had happened. and the audacity of the man; he laughs. he laughs so hard he has to sit down so he doesn't hurt himself.

his hyena/kookaburra hybrid laughter has gotten the attention of some of the other members of my team. they're looking to get in on the funny, funny joke.

i'm gonna skip past most of the laughter because it went on for what felt like forever.

i come back from lunch, and bossman and two other members of my team come up to me as i'm sitting back down at my desk getting ready to get back to work. bossman is holding a piece of paper.

""look. we need to have a chat about something. i've brought two of your friends in the team as support since this is obviously not something that's easy to talk about.""

"how do we know what ancient egyptian (or any ancient language) sounded like? how accurate are names like ""osiris"" and ""tutankhamen"" to what they actually sounded like when spoken by ancient egyptians?. egyptian is just an example in this question, and this can apply to ancient mayan mythology, or pretty much any ancient religion/society 

this has always confused me. where do our anglicanized names like these come from and how confident are we that this is what these historical and mythological figures were called by ancient peoples?

****

**update**: thanks for all the great comments, everyone. this kinda blew up so i figured i'd honor the attention this question got and consolidate some of the basic info shared in several comments i found particularly enlightening. obviously i'll save the gritty details for the comments that supplied them. this can just function as a tldr.

first of all, i'm gonna limit what i put here to just stuff related to ancient languages like egyptian, mayan, greek and latin, as opposed to information about earlier forms of spoken english and ipa usage. really interesting info, nonetheless, but slightly off topic. 

* latin, greek and mayan are easy examples since there are forms of these languages still being spoken today. several commenters actually brought up how graffiti was a great tool for deciphering phonetic elements of these languages, as lower class/uneducated people would just write words out phonetically. 

* greek was actually a useful tool in deciphering spoken egyptian, and not just because of the obvious sources like the rosetta stone. when greeks invaded egypt, they brought along with them their alphabet which had its phonetics built into it. many egyptian words then began to be written in this new alphabet, and this allows historians to cross-reference written records in different languages and build a bigger picture of language being used. 

* (this i found super interesting) names/words ending in ""is/us/os"" are tell-tale signs that these are forms of the words that came about from this greek language infusion. this means that they are absolutely not true to the way these names were originally pronounced, but this form of the name is the closest we can get to what they were called. 

* in the example of tutankhamun, several commenters pointed out that through our knowledge of coptic languages, we know that the consonant sounds are accurate, and the name breaks down into 3 distinct parts (tut, ankh, and amun) and the vowels were more or less inserted to fit modern pronunciation standards. the appropriate transcription of how we think this word was pronounced was shared by u/goltrpoat: as an example, ""tutankhamen"" (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like ""tawat 'ankhu qaman"" (taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn).

* finally, we do know that hieroglyphics stood for specific sounds and consonants, as opposed to characters each standing for a word. someone mentioned that the hieroglyphic for ""mouth"" may also look like a mouth, but that has more to do with the connection between the sound of that word (""ro"") and the sound that character represents. this part seems kind of confusing and i might have butchered that explanation in trying to simplify it. see u/ramast 's comment to see his full explanation on this point. 

thanks so much for all the great answers, everyone. it totally answered my question and questions i didn't know i had. ",9
"update: she20f lost her virginity while we were taking a break. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f\_lost\_her\_virginity\_while\_we\_were\_taking\_a/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were_taking_a/?sort=new)

hey guys. first of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

so, long story short, 3 days ago i ""broke up"" with her for good.

now, you guys might not agree with the way i did it, but i did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. even though i am sad and disappointed, at the same time i understand she wanted to see other options and i respect she didn't outright cheat on me. that being said, i am also not a backup plan and i deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

i didn't see her anymore and i finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""hey \name\, first of all, i don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. i took some days to think about it and i realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and i would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. i understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. i respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. i wanted to thank you for all those years and i wanted to apologize for any wrongs i did to you. i want you to know that i am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. i hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. goodbye, op""

the message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but i realized i am already getting over it and that i no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. she replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. so, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, i am almost certain that i would accept her back. so yeah, until next time.",7
"for despising my mentally handicap sister?. the title makes me sound horrible but hear me out.

&#x200b;

my sister is severely autistic. she requires attention almost 24/7 and cannot be left alone. she is non-verbal and cannot take care of herself at all. despite the fact that she is only 12 she is extremely destructive and violent and destroys anything she gets her hands on.

&#x200b;

i hate her. that should be wrong to say but it doesn't feel like it.

&#x200b;

i was only 6 years old when she was born and since then i've never solely had my parents attention. even since i can remember the world has revolved around her. i was moved out of my room into the basement at 7 because she needed to be in the room next to my parents. all of my toys as a child were destroyed by her and my parents simply ignored me when i complained. even when i was 14 and she destroyed a mac my school gave me i was in the wrong.

&#x200b;

along with this i am expected to take care of her and drop everything i do for her. i can never make plans with friend because my parents ""expect"" me to be there if they need me to take care of her. even when i do somehow get time to myself i am required to leave if they need me. if i do not then i am punished. the recent example of this is when i went to see the new spider man movie, and was ""grounded"" because i turned my phone off in the theater.

&#x200b;

it seems as if i am nothing more than a slave to them and anything involving her simply overshadows me. this last week i was chosen to give a speech at a school event. i was so exited and my parents promised to be there, but they never showed and claimed it was because of my sister. anytime anything like this happens for me they are to busy with her.

&#x200b;

i've held this in for so long and it finally spilled out today. while talking about colleges with my father, he joked that i should get a degree that pays well so when their gone i can take care of my sister. i don't know why but this caused me to break down. i cried and screamed about how it always about her. i'm nothing more than a caretaker to them, that they always make it about her and that i'm expected to be her ""slave"" for the rest of my life.

&#x200b;

i've locked myself in my room since then and my parents have not come to check on me. am i the asshole here?

&#x200b;

edit/update kinda:

wow, thank you for all the support and love that you guys have given me. i never expected this post to reach the popularity it did. thank you all. after thinking about it for these past hours, you are right that i don't despise my sister. it's not her fault that she was born the way she is. my parents came to talk to me a while after my break down but i was unable to bring myself to talk to them and only cried and asked them to leave. they have made arrangements with my grandfather for me to stay with him for the time being and am getting ready to go to his house. my parents want to talk to me but we have decided it's best i leave for now to have some space and time to collect myself. we will be sitting down and talking later this week about this issue. thank you all again for the love and support through this <3

"by taking a picture of my wife's ass. this happened about a week ago.

&#x200b;

i  took my wife to barns & noble to get some new books for us to read.  i was half halfheartedly looking at different books while trailing my wife throughout the store. at some point i realize my wife is nowhere to be  seen, but whatever i'll find her eventually.

&#x200b;

after  a few minutes of mindless wandering, i notice her on the other side of  the store. i also notice that her butt looks really good in the jean's shes wearing, so as i'm walking up towards her, phone camera zoomed in on her butt, i hear someone behind me shout ""hey creep! why are you  taking a picture of that girls ass!?"" i turn around to see an employee as the source of the shouting, and look towards my wife who is clutching her sides, laughing her ass off.

i  try to explain, that the woman is my wife, but the employee was having  none of it. my wife finally came to my rescue when the manager came up  and said that i had to leave. she explained that we were indeed married  and even showed her the picture of us on our wedding day she keeps in  her purse.

&#x200b;

the employee apologizes  profusely, and of course we plead with the manager not to reprimand her  for her ""outburst"" as the manager called it. honestly i'm glad she said  something as someone from the outside seeing this guy, following a girl  around the store and then taking a picture of said girls ass. it was  just a wrong place, wrong time kinda thing, but my wife has started  telling me ""don't get caught this time"" whenever we go out. shes told  just about everyone we know, and in lovingly referred to as ""the  ass-man"" in our friend group now.

&#x200b;

tl;dri took a picture of my wife's ass, an employee called me out for it, not knowing it was my wife. my wife left me high and dry until the manager asked me to leave. everyone we know, now refers to me as ""the ass-man"" now.  

and before anyone starts polishing their armor, yes, my wife knows i do this. yes, my wife is more than okay with it. she does the same thing to me.

&#x200b;

edit: just to clarify, my wife already had the picture in hand when she went up to confirm to the manager we were indeed married. the manager never doubted her affirmation that we were indeed married. i'm pretty sure she just wanted to show off her wedding dress again. 

edit2: i have asked the wife if i can share a picture and she has declined. sorry folks, enjoy this tiny ass(https://m.imgur.com/aqqoera?r) as compensation. ",4

"by making a girl i like laugh so hard she ended up in hospital and i almost lost my job.. so there's this girl i like at work, and we're really good friends. we're having lunch and we're making those ironic depression meme jokes as most friends do. for some reason i (in my unknowingly- stupid way to get her laugh) got the idea to say ""well hey, you know what's just one letter away from sad? dab!"" and promptly did the deed. also i have ability to cry on demand so i just stared stone-cold her and let two tears fall down.

she finds it funny. extremely funny. so funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. after a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. i asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. freaking the fuck out and thinking she's having a damn seizure, i start to reach for my phone.

and in the exact second, my manager randomly decides to come in and sees this big guy towering over this poor little girl on the floor. i only manage to cut off her impending rage by saying i think she's having a seizure and i'm calling 911. fortunately, i was able to explain to her what happened after the ambulance came.

turns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. whoops.

tl;dr. made i joke with a girl that ended causing a asthma flare-up, manager walked in when it happened. she ended up in the hospital and i almost lost my job.

"by making my boyfriend a tinder account. okay so necessary this actually happened in the last couple of weeks. basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it's not like he's too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. 

obviously i think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though i've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. so, for some stupid reason, i decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. i set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

after a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after i showed this to him, i saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

queue my surprise when a couple of days later i check the tinder account i had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and i could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

i confronted him and he denied it but i mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity i checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. so now the tinder i made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

tl;dr: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

"i killed an elderly man in front of his wife and basically his entire family.. forgive me for any misspellings or format i'm trying to do this on my phone.  i haven't talked about this to anyone (even though it's been years) even my closest of friends, minus the ones that were there.

one nite when i was in college i was driving to get some liquor for a party my fraternity was supposed to throw the following night.

i was taking a street i was very familiar with to get back to my house.  it was dark but the street was lit with street lamps.  i remember that i looked at my radio for a second, just a second not very long at all.  but when i looked back up to the road  there was a man crossing.

i didn't have any time to react, by the time i saw him he had already hit the good of my car and bounced off the side.  i remember screaming and hitting the brakes, and the wash of horror of what had just happened.  i'll admit i had thought about speeding away, but i pulled over to the side and ran out of my car to check on this guy.

when i got to him his family was standing outside the restaurant he was leaving and they were all screaming and crying.  he has laying on the side of the road with blood coming out his nose and mouth. two other men were standing with him trying to see if he was alright and calling 911.  all i could say was ""i didn't see him"" i was frantic by the time it had set in what i had done.

i sat on the curb across from the family and listened to their crying in agony while we waited for the paramedics to arrive.  i sat there and sobbed while to paramedics took him away in an ambulance.  i don't believe i've ever cried so hard and for so long.  the worst part about all of it and what still kills me today was that his wife came over to me while i was distraught on that curb, sat next to me, placed her hand on my shoulder and said ""i was married to him for almost 50 years.  we had a good life."" then she hugged me and said that she forgave me.


  after everything was said and done it was ruled that it was an accident.  i wasn't charged with anything and i had one of my friends pick me up from the police station.  i went down a dark path the years after that.  i drank heavily, dropped out of college in my senior year, and had to move back in with my mother and father because i couldn't hold on to a job.  even tried to kill myself with pills.  it was a hard road to recovery (witch i feel i'm not fully recovered from nor do i feel i ever will be the same). but eventually i got my life back in order.  joined up with the navy and saw a bit of the world, and now i'm on track to go back to college and hopefully finish what i started there.   it took almost a decade but i finally start to feel almost whole again.  i'm back to hanging with my friends, and actually going out.  so maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel.

"i kicked my son out of our house for being gay. he became an alcoholic and nearly drank himself to death.. this was in 1991, my son was 18 and going to a local college. me and my wife considered ourselves sort of a normal new jersey italian catholic family, we were traditional and fairly ignorant to most things. we hated the perceived feminization of culture, images of drag queens in nyc and aids and the tight pants of modern kids made us recoil in horror. 

my wife found gay porn magazines in my sons room. i came home to a shit storm, she was freaking out at him, i asked why and she showed me what it was. i felt my heart drop down into my stomach, it was like a punch to the gut. he was *gay*? it felt like the ultimate betrayal to us, betraying our religion, betraying the normal, 'healthy' upbringing we gave him. we had zero concept of the idea of being born gay, we thought it was something you made a choice to engage in, and once you did it you couldn't stop. everything that we had given him, a normal, religious, traditional home, with enough money to go to college and relative freedom to do what he wants, and he just threw it all away. at least, that is what i thought at the time. he was my only precious thing in the world, my son, the person who would inherit my families name, the man who i raised from a child to be a man, but at that moment was the furthest thing from a real man in my mind i could imagine. i made the choice right then and there that he was no son of mine, he was just a sissy bitch who happened to live in my house. 

i know how horrific this sounds, because it was horrific. and it was how almost everyone who lived in our community felt. we were constantly spewed with propaganda to hate gay people and ideas that the youth were all gay and experimenting and getting aids and dressing as women. the hair metal, men wearing makeup, david bowie, the drag queens in new york across the hudson, freddy mercury, the ridiculous clothing of the era, it all gave the worldview that the world was turning into some gay, womanly wonderland. 

anyways, i barely even spoke to him. my wife was the one who did all the yelling. i just went red in the face and couldn't even look at him. she told him to get the fuck out and go to new york to live with his friends, who she assumed were all gay (and she was right, mostly). she physically hit him, a lot, and got him to pack his stuff while he was crying and told him to get out. 

me and my wife were just devastated afterwards, we went to church a lot, my wife told all the other families in the area and they were horrified at my son. i remember when we told our priest, who was a very nice, accepting man, about our son he looked to be disgusted, but when we told him we kicked him out he looked at us in disgust, or at least hided it a tiny bit. living without my son hurt. it also made me rethink things over time. i still saw him almost as a inhuman person, to be gay, to me at that time, was so sinful and horrific that it was impossible to truly consider accepting them as real, normal people. 

me and my wife grew apart in the 6 months following my son leaving. she started to drink a lot, and she was a nasty drunk. she had a history of alcoholism, i knew how bad it could get. this was the worst i had ever seen her. we fought constantly over stupid things, and all i could think about was that when our son was here, we never fought, he always calmed us down. 

in the end, i got kicked out of my own home, she just told me to leave. i moved to new york to live with my brother in bay ridge, we got divorced officially a few months later. she would die from liver failure 7 years later. 

i made the choice, a conscious choice, to find out where my son was. at that point my life was just in shambles and i was rethinking everything about how i viewed my religion, my life, and i was just so horribly depressed and lonely. finding him was a nightmare of itself, it took two weeks of calling homeless shelters and asking around at them if they had seen my son months ago. i finally found him in an apartment in williamsburg. i saw him and apologized, and i told him that i am so sorry i kicked him out. part of me was still in the same mindset as before, i was still a raging homophobe, but i tried to push that part away and just be with my son and ignore everything else. 

he was a severe alcoholic. my first thought when i saw him, sweaty and skinny and sickly looking, was aids. but no, it was alcoholism. it runs in the family. he said that it started soon after i kicked him out, and that he was horribly depressed and turned to drinking heavily. even his roommates said it was a major problem. 

for the next 3 months i spent a lot of time focusing on getting him clean. i met his friends, about half of whom were gay, and we worked together to help him. he went to a detox clinic, he went to rehab. we spent a lot of emotional days together. i didn't want to lose him, even though just a year before i was desperate to get rid of him. the thought of him dying, right after this... because we kicked him out... it was just too much to bear. i made the decision that if he died, i would probably commit suicide after. but he would get clean, then relapse 4 months later, then get clean again for 2 years, then relapse again. then he quickly recovered. and he would never touch another drop again. 

spending that time with my son, and seeing how he lived and more importantly actually seeing how these gay men lived their lives, mostly completely normally, it completely changed me as a human being. in 1996, i went to my first pride parade with my son to support him and his boyfriend at the time. i took a heavy interest in the lgbt community and went with my son to visit his friends in aids clinics. if you were to have told me in 1991 that i would be going to an aids clinic with a drag queen and being friendly with everyone by 1997, i wouldn't believe you in the slightest. 

anyways this post has been days in the making. i love reddit even if i am a bit old for it haha. i have told my story before to a journalist and it was published. if you feel deja vu reading this, i would very much prefer if you didn't reveal my identity on this post or post the article.

"by watching my neighbours fight while i was eating popcorn.. so i'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally i was watching the match on my living room little did i know there was another match going on my neighbours house. about ten minutes into my game, i started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.

between the game and the distance between us i really couldn't distinguish any words, so i just raised the volume of my tv and kept watching. during half time i got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so i lower the volume of the tv as i microwave some popcorn.

by this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as i take the popcorns out of the microwave i hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so i went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case i had to call the cops of something. now i have two dogs so i didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so i brought it with me.

so here i am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. for the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. by now i could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so i thought. suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as i gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.

now try to see this from their perspective. they've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. this got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.

""enjoying the show you \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!?""

i honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. they both flip the finger at me as walked inside ""can you believe this fucking guy!?"" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.

when i got inside i was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.

edit: i know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments i've gotten.  you all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! also shut out to all the cruz azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game i was watching!

edit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a and it probably isn't a dramatic one i'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.

tl;dr my neighbours were having a big fight while i was watching a soccer game, i went out to check while she slapped her husband as i was holding a big bag of popcorn. my nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again.",4
"i snooped on the ceo's email account and got myself unfired. a couple years out of college i worked as an analyst at a pretty small private equity firm. the ceo was one of the biggest assholes i've ever met. he was fairly young in his 40s, a multi millionare, and the type of guy driven solely by money with 0 business ethics. he'd do anything to get the upper hand in a deal regardless of who it screws over...contractors, employees...i even saw him seriously fuck over a long time family friend of his without any remorse.

anyway, aside from my analyst role, as it was a really small business (only about 20 people in the office, and then a bunch of people working remote), i also happened to be one of the only semi technology-literate people in the company. so like many of my generation, i became the defacto ""millenial office computer guy"" too. despite my lack of qualifications i got put in charge of handling pretty much anything minor tech related. setting up servers....fixing laptop issues...answering ""how do i convert this to pdf"" questions...even basic network security. they thought i was some sort of computer genius...but really i was just mostly winging it, googling pretty much everything.

but eventually i got legitimately pretty good at all the tech stuff. they gave me bigger tasks like planning all of the computer systems for their owned businesses, and supervising installs. i didn't get paid extra for any of this mind you.

after a couple years of serious bullshit working there, i was pretty worn out. i wasn't progressing. i hated working for captain douchebag...he treated everyone like shit. i was pulling 12-14+ hour days with no overtime or performance bonus. and they weren't paying me nearly what they should have. i also hated being ""the tech guy"" and was depressed as fuck basically living in a cubicle. so i decided i full on had enough of the 9-8 life working for assholes....and i would start my own consulting business working for myself.

however, instead of quitting right away, i figured it would be smart to first build up my client base on the side while i was still getting a steady paycheck. so thats what i did. i launched my company, and landed my first clients.

as the workload increased, i slowly started spending more and more time working on my side business while at my office job. at first i was pretty low key about it. but eventually, it was blatant. as it was a super small company....i was the only one who knew how to do a lot of important tasks and operate some key internal systems. it was easy for me to tell my boss a project was taking a whole week to complete, that i actually finished in 10 minutes.

pretty soon i was spending 80% of my day working on my own stuff in the office. i'd even take calls for my side business clients at my desk. the rest of the time i was usually dicking around on reddit or something. of course, we had systems in place to monitor network activity. but i was the person in charge of monitoring it.

this continued for a while. as my own business ramped up, i cared less and less about the office job. and since i hated waking up early, i began rolling into work late. at first it was only 30 minutes or so. then it progressed to an hour. when my boss didn't reprimand me...it became clear how much they needed me there. i took full advantage of this. before long i was arriving around noon, working for a couple hours, then heading home. 

my coworkers werent happy, but i helped them with all of their tech problems and they hated the company too, so they kept their mouths shut about it. my boss eventually said something to me about all it at one point, but i just came in on time the next few days and then went back to coming in whenever i wanted.

after more than 2 months of coming in 4-5 hours late, and working on my side business in full view of my asshole boss, i couldn't believe i wasn't fired yet. i deserved it and felt it was inevitable.

on a hunch, i decided to do a little investigative work. as i was the ""tech guy"", i also had full access to the company email server. so i logged into the ceo's personal email account, and searched for my name. lo and behold, there was a recent email thread between him, my direct boss, and some other team members with my name in the subject line. obviously i open it. they're discussing my recent performance issues...the last email in the chain basically said ""if nobody has any objections, i will be terminating him at the end of the week"". 2 days from then.

i wasn't surprised, but i decided there was no way i was going to let these assholes fire me. although i didn't give a shit about that job, i didn't want to have a termination in my work history. i also wanted to keep getting paid for a while longer. of course, i couldn't let him know i actually knew i was getting canned. so, i formulated a plan to perform a little inception reverse-psychology mind fuck on the ceo.

the next day, one day before they planned to fire me, i requested a meeting with him to ""discuss my current performance."". in that meeting i sat down, and he asked me what i wanted to talk about. so i told him (paraphrased): ""look, i know i've been a shitty employee lately. i'm sure you've noticed. correct me if i'm wrong, but i've been kind of getting the feeling you guys are planning to let me go soon."" when i said that the shocked look on his face was priceless...he must have thought i was psychic to work that out on my own the day before it was going to happen. i remember him just saying something like ""uhh"". i continued while he sat flabbergasted. ""so i'll be honest with you, my heart isn't in this job anymore. as you know, i'm an entrepreneur at heart...which i'm sure you can relate to. i want to start my own company. however, as you're aware, i have a lot of responsibilities here nobody else can do."" i then proceeded to list all of the things i did and projects i was working on. i could see it on his face when the realization sunk in of how screwed he'd be if i left suddenly.

""so here's what i propose. you don't fire me. i don't quit. i keep working here for a month, finish my current projects, and train whoever you want on everything i'm in charge of. after a month is up, i will continue to come in once per week until its complete. after that, if you still need me...you can pay me on an hourly project-by-project basis"".   

i intentionally mentioned the possibility of me quitting so he could feel like he ""won"" the negotiation, even though i technically had him by the balls. 

he paused to think for a minute, then said something along the lines of: ""okay. you have a deal"".  

so, not only did i get myself unfired...i actually turned the company into a paying client. during that month, i continued doing pretty much whatever i wanted since i had an expiration date (while training my replacement as promised). after the month was up they hit me up regularly for remote task work . i charged them triple what i was earning while working there, and barely had to deal with the ceo.  my client base was big enough i dropped them for good.

...after all that, the ceo still calls me up for advice/questions nearly 3 years later. these days i just blow him off saying ""sorry, i'm too busy"".

**edit:** as it seems there's some doubt that this actually happened (it did), figured i'd clarify a few points.

1) this was a very small company. the office had about 20 people in it, and several dozen more worked remote. if you've never worked in a small office before, i can assure you it's pretty normal for employees to wear many hats and take on random roles outside their initial scope. it's also pretty normal for them to be severely lacking with network security and controlling passwords. 

2) i did not become some ""computer genius"" and never claimed to be (tho my company of technology illiterate baby boomers sometimes thought of me that way). i had decent basic working knowledge coming into the job, and picked up more over the several years i was there. for anything complicated (like wiring, hardware installs, advanced networking tasks etc) we hired outside it consultants. but i was the guy who would source them, hire them, supervise them and learn the systems they put in place. and i just handled more basic tasks myself . we're also not talking about enterprise level security here either

3) my consulting business has nothing to do with private equity. im not going to reveal exactly what i do for privacy sake since this blew up, but it's in marketing. i didn't steal any of my old company's clients when i left and don't compete with them**

4) yes, im fully aware and admit i was an asshole, hence posting this in /r/confession. in fact i decided to start my own company because i hate working for other people without my own skin in the game. i'm not a great employee when i don't care about what i'm doing. however, the guys running the company were pretty shitty people, and i did not feel that bad about it at the time. 
  
      the thing i did have reservations about was snooping on the emails. i do not condoned invading privacy like that. however, he'd freely given me the passwords (so i could help him set up his outlook, forwarding, etc), and i felt me getting fired was inevitably coming soon. ",11
"by saying i was tired to my wife.. came home from the gym. its leg day. had full day at work too. work isn't bad. came home to happy kids. wife does a great job at keeping them alive. the best. had to take a shower before bed. wife says hurry because shes tired. i empathize by saying i will hurry because i am also tired. bad idea. wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. i do not dispute this since i am not a total moron. kids are exhausting but totally worth it. i tell her as much. she is most tired. i am only kind of tired. not good enough. she is more tired. i agree with this in order to ease the tension. unsuccessful. she is fully triggered by the fact that i had the audacity to say that i was tired. there is no escape. am screwed. 


tldr: am not allowed to be tired. ever.

edit: wow. that's a lot of comments and stuff. thanks, reddit. this weekend i will celebrate with a nap! cheers! what makes this cool is that i wrote it while pooping before bed. cant wait to tell my wife!

edit 2: my wife is the best. seriously the best. i'm not taking her back to the dealership. this was one of those events where you laugh about it 5 minutes later.  tonight we are going on a date so it's all good.


that a lot of you guys would not survive married life or kids. lol.

final edit: i am so thankful for my normal wife her normal, valid frustration with how i said what i said. either one of us could have easily ended up with one of you nut cases on here. lol. i can never  unsee some of this cringe and i cant wait to share all of these hilarious/insane opinions with her durning our date tonight. gotta go put on my clean underpants!",4
"wife had a stroke. need to protect family and estate.. my wife (38) had a stroke that left her with no motor function. she will require care for the rest of her life. we have two little girls. 11 and 8. i need advice on how to protect the estate if anything were to happen to me. i don't want her ongoing care to drain the estate if i'm gone. i also need to set up protection for our kids. i have so many questions about long term disability, social security, etc. i'm overwhelmed and don't know where to begin. 

edit #1 i am meeting with a social worker this afternoon. update: social worker was amazing and she says the kids are doing very well and to keep doing what i'm doing. the kids like her and i'll continue to have her check in on them.

edit #2 my wife has a school loan. can i get this absolved?

edit #3 my wife is a rn making $65k/year. i've contacted her manager about her last paycheck and cashing out her pto. 

edit #4 wow amazing response. as you can imagine, i have a lot going on right now. i plan to read through these comments this evening. 

edit #5 well, i've had even less time than expected to read everything. i've been able to skim through and i'm feeling like i have a direction now and a lot of good information to reference along the way. 

edit #6 update: she is living with her retired parents now and going to outpatient rehab 3 days a week. she is making progress towards recovery, but at this point she still needs more attention than i can provide her. the kids and i travel the 2.5 hour drive every weekend to be with her. i believe that she will eventually be well enough to come home, but i don't know when that will be. could be a few months, or it could be a few years. 
recently, she has begun to eat more food orally and i think we are on a path to remove her feeding tube. she is also gaining strength vocally. she's hard to understand, but she says some words very well. a little strength is returning to her left side, but too soon to tell if it will continue. her right side is very strong. she can stand with assistance.  thanks to the reddit community for your concern. i hope to continue posting positive updates.

"for dropping the ""we're not having kids, now stop bringing it up"" bomb on my mil?.  my husband and i don't want kids. my mil is big into family in the traditional sense. she has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

my husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. every time we see her, she asks. everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""we might not even have kids"" and mil would *not*hear it. at year 4, husband had a vasectomy and i had a tubal.

so this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some bbq and drinks and everything. when i get up to grab a beer, my mil asks me if maybe i should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

i was annoyed by this and said ""there's really no chance.""

mil, all wide-grin, said, ""oh come on! it's time for you two to finally get serious! put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

i said ""we've been official for about 5 years now, mil,"" and drink the beer. husband laughs with me.

mil gets more annoyed and says ""well, you won't be real (lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

husband said, ""mom, enough."" mil pushed again. husband repeated.

after about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, i finally snapped and said ""mil, husband got snipped. i had my tubes tied. we're not having kids. you need to stop bringing it up. period.""

well, i thought i started wwiii. she started crying and stormed off. family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. we left. party kinda ended. the social media bullshit started shortly after. vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. some meme about how ""i guess i wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" it's obnoxious to the point that i just muted all of them.

my mil finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if husband and i came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. i told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""well then, i guess you two aren't prepared to be real (lastname)s. i'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (it wasn't that much. it was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

i hung up on her. when recounting this to my friends, a few of them said that i was the asshole here for dropping it like that. but i don't think she was ever going to drop it if i didn't finally make a serious, direct comment about it. so aita?",3
"my son beat up another boy and i'm so proud of him.. so my son was being bullied pretty badly at school. people would make fun of his accent, use racial slurs towards him, throw open milk cartons at him at lunch, start rumors about him, they put his book bag in the toilet once, and a bunch of fucked shit kids do to each other. my son had told on the main perpetrator to me and his mother and i went to the school and told them about my concerns and the school gave him a stern talking to which only stopped him for a few weeks and then he continued to bully my son. so i went to the school and complained again and the administration had told me that they spoke to the kid and he had told them that he was just joking and he didnt mean any of the stuff he was saying and that they were actually friends anyway the assistant principal told me that ""boys will be boys"" and that it was not out of the ordinary for boys to make fun of each other, but since the kid had admitted to doing it they gave him in-school suspension which is essentially a slap on the wrist. so after that i realized that nothing was going to happen if i kept running back to the administration every time my son came home crying so i took matters into my own hands. (now im going to tell you something about me. in my home country i was an amateur boxer but due to the financial situation i was in, my mother did not want me to box she wanted me to work and study, so i cut a deal with her if i made that if to the olympics i would go pro after but if i failed i would stop and work and go to university. anyway i failed and stopped boxing and got a job and finished my studies.) ok so what i did was taught my son how to fight. everyday after i get home from work for the past 9 months i take him to the local boxing gym and taught him how to hit the bag, throw combinations, taught him about foot work and movement, how to work the speed bag, how to dodge, hit the pads and everything i else i knew from my old days as a boxer. it worked wonders for my son not only did he become physically stronger, he also became mentally strong, he stopped coming home crying, he started to make friends and it had a real positive effect on him. when i would ask him if he was still getting bullied he said it didnt bother him what people he didnt care about said about him, so i figured that was the end of the bully problem, i was wrong. two weeks ago i get a call from school that my son had gotten into a fight and that i had to go pick him up because he and the other boy were both suspended for 5 days for fighting. when i go to pick my son up he is covered in blood, which was alarming at first but then he told me that it was not his blood it was the other boy, the one who put his bag in the toilet kept walking up to him and using racial insults towards him and my son told him if he didnt stop he was going to beat him up, and he kept his promise. turns out my son broke the other kids nose, busted his lip and hit the other kids eye and it had swollen shut. my son has some bruises on his face but nothing compared to the other kid. now my son has been getting yelled at alot by his mother, she made him write and apology letter to the boy, the boys parents, to the principal, to the teacher, to the security guard who broke it up and she is really mad at me and blames me for this because i taught him how to fight but i honestly could not be more proud of him. he's getting whatever he wants for christmas from me. sorry for the horrible grammar english is not my first language. no regrets",11

"parents shouldn't teach their kids that boys can't hit girls because it's wrong but should teach them that hitting everyone is wrong and they should expect to be hit back if they ever do hit someone, regardless if they're a boy or girl. i've noticed parents telling their children that boys should never hit girls, ever. my parents told this to my younger siblings and this has actually turned my younger sister into a bully towards my brother because when my sister hits my brother she doesn't get in that much trouble but when my brother hits my sister back he's called a bully or a girl beater. 

these girls will then grow up to think that men can't hit women and think that they can just bully their boyfriends or husbands but now both men and women are agreeing that if a woman hits a man, he can hit her back, so these women could be in for a nasty surprise

i'm not saying every girl will grow up to be like this, just a small minority but i feel they still need to be taught that. 

and same for boys, boys should be taught that they shouldn't hit anyone without reason and to expect a hit back because if thought wrong, these boys may turn into bullies towards girls.

edit; if a woman hits a man, the man should defend himself. self defence is important but if the woman poses no real danger then he shouldn't hit back unless really necessary. he definetaley should try and restrain that woman though. 

same if a smaller, weaker man hits a larger, stronger man. if that man poses no real danger then there should be no reason for the bigger guy to just destroy the weaker man.

this post is only to say that parents should teach their kids, especially girls but boys also that a man may hit back if they hit them. that way the girls may not grow up to hit men as if they know a man may hit them back, they'll be too scared to hit the man first. men are also biligically stronger than women so if a man hits a woman hard enough, he can cause serious injury or death so teaching these girls this could potentially prevent these injuries or death",6
"wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. i literally do not know what to do. this is long, **tl;dr** at bottom.

my wife and i have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  she's always been one of the most amazing people i've ever met. no huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. that's why this is so difficult for me.

we've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  she's in marketing and i work independently as an it consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  we decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  we've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

long story short, i was diagnosed with azoospermia last december.  blockage in the pipes just meant i wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. it's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this july.  she's got a high sex drive as do i, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way i could have gotten her pregnant.

she missed her period this week.  i couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  the babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  she took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

at first i was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. she's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. i'm not the jealous type, but i'm literally stuck.  the doctors said this couldn't happen.  and i can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

my wife's been ecstatic. she's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. she was so excited when she first found out that i didn't express my worries then.  but she left for work and now i feel completely torn.  what if she did cheat?

looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. she definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. she always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  i remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

fuck man i don't know what to do.  i set up an appointment on monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  if it is mine and i accuse her of cheating i feel like the world's biggest asshole. but she's coming home in a few hours and i don't know what i'm going to say to her, i can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and i just didn't see it.

do i wait until the doctor appointment monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? i'm worried i won't be able to hide what's going on.

**tl;dr:  wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july.  wife got pregnant anyways.  it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.  want to wait until monday, but don't think i can hide it.  what do i tell her?**

**edit:**  i should add i've been cheated on before.  our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  i'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**edit** i really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  my wife's coming home though in an hour and i have to decide if i'm going to put on a happy face until monday or not.

**edit** she texted saying she's going be home late

this is bringing up some old emotional scars i think and is just fucking with me.  i'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  i think i need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

"i killed my pet iguana. it was 12 years ago, i was 7. his name was leafy and i had him for several months. my father and i built him a special terrarium made out of an old chest. one day, i opened it up to feed him (he would only eat if i hand-fed him) and he jumped directly at me. i panicked and shut the trunk immediately, but to my dismay i shut it right on him, directly on his back. half his body was inside the trunk, half outside. it didn't cut him in half, but it definitely hurt him severely. his little iguana mouth was wide open, as if voicelessly screaming in agony. i opened the trunk and he fell back down, seemingly paralyzed.

for the next few days he would eat a little and move around, but on the third or fourth day i woke up and he was dead. my guess was that i probably tore up his insides and fatally injured his back. his last few days must've been in agony. he didn't even live that great of a life, and he was only four months old.

"i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i don't know what to say to her.. hey everyone. i don't know what to do in this situation because i never expected i'd face something like this. i'm trying to stay calm and rational and examine every possibility but i'm coming up seriously short here.

i met my wife on tinder at the end of 2015. we talked on and off for some time before she agreed to meet me. by the end of our first date we found that we had so much in common that we even agreed we should have met a lot earlier. we were both into the same sport, we were both into the same books, and we both saw eye to eye on social/political matters. more than anything, we were both against the idea of having kids. 

i know, heavy topics for a first date. we were on a roll and just kept talking and before we knew it we were three to four dates ahead of the curve.

at the very least i held off on telling her about my vasectomy until the third. her immediate reaction upon hearing about it was of an instant of shock, where she couldn't believe a young guy would get one. she immediately followed that by commending me for my conviction about being child free.

we dated and had a great time with few real arguments, and eventually settled down with a big wedding and a big house. after getting married, if anything our relationship has only gotten better. 

four nights ago was the first time i ever had any serious doubts about our relationship. my wife was out with a friend, and i was doing some house cleaning. i was throwing away a bunch of semi-large garbage that can fit into bags, and so i took a few things out of the kitchen garbage bag to make everything fit into two. at the bottom i saw a light purple box where half of a lower case n and an upper case b were visible. i immediately recognized it for what it was and reassembling the torn pieces just confirmed it.

i had known that my wife was on her period because when i tried to initiate sex, she told me so. i found it odd because her previous period had ended just a couple of weeks before and i made comment about the timing being odd. she told me it's just lady stuff and it happens sometimes. i figured it made enough sense and let the issue rest.

i haven't told her that i found the box. when she got home that night everything was so normal. i tried to gauge how she was feeling or if she seemed like she was trying to hide anything, but couldn't find a single thing.

the more time this simmers inside of me, the more the possibilities start springing to mind. what if she was assaulted? what if she was covering for someone else by bringing the box home and disposing of it here? what if she, for some reason, just felt pregnant randomly? or, what if she just cheated? i only know one thing for certain: unless someone broke into our house to dispose of a box of plan b and cover it with a bunch of other trash haphazardly, she was the only person other than me who could have thrown it away. 

i don't even know how to ask her or how to bring it up. we have both expressed adamantly that cheating is ridiculous because if you're dissatisfied enough in a relationship to be unfaithful, you should just leave. i've done nothing to displease her, at least that i know of. maybe i'm just naive or maybe the situation is more complicated than i'm giving it credit for. but i feel like a coward for being unable to bring it up four days later just because i don't know how.

**tl;dr** i found a torn up plan b box in my trash. the only person who could have possibly thrown it away there is my wife. how do i bring this up?",7

"by performing the ""major tom"" technique and now i think i'm going to be disowned. if you aren't familiar with the ""major tom"", it's because it's a thing i (hopefully) came up with. it's a form of ""auto-erotic asphyxiation"" by using gravity.

basically, you jack off normally; but before you nut, you squat down as low as you can to the ground and breathe short shallow breaths while still whacking it. this part is called ""getting in the shuttle.""

as you nut, you jump up from that squatting position as fast as you possibly fucking can and hold your breath. this is considered ""take off.""

if performed correctly, you should become very lightheaded and experience pure bliss due to the orgasm from your cock rocket. this is called ""being in space"" due to the fact you feel like you're floating.

this is a technique that should be performed only by professionals, in a controlled environment. **i, however,** am not a professional despite creating the technique. you see, by hyperventilating and jumping up, you are literally cutting your brain off from oxygen. no oxygen = no consciousness.

when i ""took off"" i fucking jumped up at mach 50 and must've ripped a fucking hole in the goddamn space-time continuum. because the next thing i know i was laying on the ground with my dick out, covered in space juices from my trip around the sun.

before i could even pick myself up off the ground, my mom rushed into my room to see if i was okay. she heard my re-entry. this part is called ""disappointing your mother.""

you can just imagine the scene she walked into.

she stared at me with a mix of disgust, anger, and again, disappointment. i stared back with what i thought was confidence like i was buzz aldrin and just got back from the moon. but thinking back on it, it was probably embarrassment while i was desperately trying to put my space plane back in the hangar while getting on my feet as quickly as possible, and due to the fact, she's never caught me before. (at least not to my knowledge.)

she ended up closing the door and stomping her way back to the living room, presumably to watch more judge judy, and to take her mind off of what she just fucking witnessed; or consider disowning me. i cleaned myself up, taking off my spacesuit and putting civilian clothing on. somehow none of the rocket fuel managed to get in the carpet, just my clothes, and i managed to not even injure myself in the crash.

i'm currently writing this in my room right now, and i don't plan on leaving it anytime soon until i can think of what to say to her. if there is anything to say at all.

**tl;dr: tried a new experimental masturbatory technique, ended up passing out, mom caught me with my pants down, and now i'm stuck in my room. planet earth is blue and there's nothing i can do.**

"i m 32 ruined christmas and i have no regrets.. is anyone else's family this dysfunctional? every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years i was the one who blew up for the first time. 

long story short, i'm half-korean/half-white. my mom is korean. my dad side is white. so we only have my dad's side here in the us. for years, i watched my some of my dad's side speak down to my mom. they never invite her to things. me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. to be frank, i don't care how i'm treated. every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it's only 2-3 times a year. we repeat the process and don't expect much from these family members. my mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. my white grandma is 80 and she's the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

three times today i watched a family member (aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn't speak english and shut her down over simple questions like ""where should i sit?"". i watched my mom quietly recoil and i couldn't stand to see it again. this aunt does it the most and i finally blew up. i yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. i told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. to stop speaking to my mom (who's lived in the us for 35 years) like she doesn't speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. i watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

my aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. as she was leaving i walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom's yearly gift to her. i said  ""for 30 years i watched my mom give you a gift every year. i watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. i've never seen you treat her with the same"".  she didn't say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

before i left, i apologized to everyone and explained why i was upset. everyone was shocked how mad i got. i felt like everyone understood why i was mad.  prior to this (around thanksgiving) i spoke to some family members about how i was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. which they have been trying to do more. 

after blowing up, it made things awkward. people trickled out early too. now my grandma is talking about not doing christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. i feel bad, but i've never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. does anyone have any advice on this? handling rude family?  should i do something else? 


edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below

mom's reaction: on the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. she's always taken the high road it's a very korean christian mom approach. my mom's method of being a pacifist is very much an older immigrant/korean/boomer approach too. it's taught me a valuable skill in life. i don't regret picking my battles and that's why i'm so appreciative of being korean/white. after we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. she didn't say anything and asked me if i wanted my favorite korean dish. 

where is my dad: he was in the other room. yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. he's gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. we'd be fighting every year with someone new if we didn't pick our battles. we would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. my dad is the only one who isn't petty about dumb shit. defending my mom is everyone's responsibility not just my dad. including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. as soon as i got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (i can't describe it). there wasn't much for him to say or do because he didn't hear it. i was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. my white side has a ""keep grandma"" happy approach which is dumb. for years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn't. 

me: reflecting on this as a whole. i can't believe the response. it shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. after thanksgiving i started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. i have no relationship with this aunt. i should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who's 30 years younger. a small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. if she's not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), ""f*ck her"".  please don't use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. i should have tried to speak and i did what i felt was right, i don't regret it.. grandma's 80th bday is in two months.  i can't wait for that to be awkward. someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. cheers and have a happy new years!

update 12/29/18
i wrote a letter to my aunt explaining further how i felt and i didn't want this to affect how our family gatherings. i explained for years she's treated my mom like an outsider in how she talks to my mom. i told her if she speaks to my mom a littler nicer she will get nothing but respect from me. i told her i wished i had a better relationship to tell her this years ago. i told her i want nothing in return but her to be nicer to my mom. i'm leaving how we move forward in her hands.

i called my grandma to let her know i sent a letter to my aunt to try and fix things. i told her i didn't want this to ruin our family gatherings. my grandma apologized for not saying something earlier to my aunt. i was right for standing up for my mom. also.. this was amazing, my grandma told me ""i never wanted your mom to ever feel like an outsider in our family"" 
 
tldr: after 32 years i finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something i've been feeling for years. how do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. should i do something for blowing up?

"my niece's (5) school allowed a person to visit her at lunch and bring her a drink, all without this person being on the list of people my sister (26) approved to have contact with her.. located in oklahoma, usa

my sister and i have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. my niece told my sister about it when she got home. my sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. so they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

the principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. the only thing i can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? they risked my niece's safety and i think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but i'm not sure what could be done.

update: my sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. the board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. the school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. thank you to the people who were helpful!",2

don't get me wrong, there are some exceptions to this rule--if someone has the ability to help with something, but doesn't want to get off their ass, but still wants brownie points for ""helping"" and so they pull the ""i'll pray"" card, then yes, they are the asshole.

"similar to increasing wealth gap, are we experiencing an increasing educational gap? are well-educated getting more educated and under-educated staying under-educated?. edit: thanks everyone for many different perspectives and interesting arguments!

one statistic brought up was global educational attainment rising overall, which is a quite well-known development, and i'm glad it is taking place.

another point brought up was education and degrees. in this question, i don't necessarily equal attained education with received degrees but rather with actual acquired knowledge, including knowledge gained through non-institutional education. 

i realize we need quantifiable ways to measure educational attainment and awarded degrees is one of them. though imperfect, it is better than non-existent. one just has to be careful about interpreting what exactly that number tells us. it also begs the question: what is the best way to measure acquired knowledge?

an educational gap has existed in some form since the dawn of formal education. however, in case there is a trend of a growing educational gap, what concerns me is the possible emergence of an **educational divide**. depending on the definition of ""educational divide"" and high-quality data available, such divide might potentially be underway.",9
"update my ex girlfriend committed suicide.. i am a firefighter and had to find her body. its been a bit over 6 months since i posted that story and i want to give you a quick update on my life. im on mobile so i apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 tl;dr my ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. she was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. i am a firefighter in nj, but go to school in nh. i received the call and conducted research to find her. i drove back down to help with the search. we found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. i was in a dark place for a while after that. i drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. for a good amount of time i distanced myself from any girl who i met.

the funeral wasnt long after and jim didnt even show up. im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


i didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. it felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. the depression i felt was destructive.

my chief reached out to me not long after because i never told him how i knew her. he asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. i was in nh so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

i lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. i had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

after 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. i met this really nice girl named sarah. we talked  and even hooked up a couple times. after a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. i told her i couldnt. i told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. she took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. i felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. i didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

fast forward another month my friend kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. i accepted and thats when i met kristen. kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. we ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. i opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. she completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

she convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. so i made an appointment and went. the therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. i joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

i did my first story and kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. it was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. i continued doing these events and kristen went to every single one. 

after 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. she understood. weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

every time im in nj i go to lydias house and support her mom. on christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

the way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. and if it wasnt for kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.",7
"cops completely destroyed interior of my car looking for drugs, found nothing. i had purchased a used cadillac a few months ago for a good price from a mechanic i knew. he said his son was driving it. when i first purchased, i noticed a small container with what appeared to be trace amounts and a scent reminiscent of bho oil, wax, shatter, dabs,... whatever you want to call it. i threw it away and searched the car thoroughly to make sure there was nothing else in the vehicle. 
flash forward to the other night and i was pulled over for an improper lane change. officer was nice enough but said he thought he saw me making suspicious movements when i was being pulled over. he asked to search the vehicle and which point i said no. waited half an hour for the dog to show up. he alerted to my side driver said at which point they had probably caused and they searched the vehicle.  he checked all the normal spaces like the glove compartment, center console, side panels, trunk,... and they found nothing. after his point they started to separate the bit of material under the steering wheel and continued to thrash the entire vehicle. they cut into the leather seats. they also cut into my spare tire. mind you, i have no criminal background and actually am in the process of working in law enforcement. they cut open just about everything in the car and searched everywhere and found nothing. i'm obviously growing increasingly agitated at this point but the officer standing with me on the curb was anticipating this ordered me to remain quiet and wait patiently. after this well over 2 hour ordeal, i was told i was free to go. when asking the officer if they were offering any restitutions for the damages they caused, he simply told me to call the county. before i do that i would like to know if there's any better options and how i should pursue this. the seats obviously had a razor blade go thru them and there's so many things dangling they made the car look closer to what i probably would've payed for it. not to mention they also ruined my spare. thank you.

"to girls who friendzone guys: they're not obligated to keep being your friend. i say this as a gay man who sees this with many of my female friends. 

if you have a guy friend who makes a move and you put him in the friend zone, he has every right to not stay in your life. some guys want to date you plain and simple. these guys probably had a crush on you from the start and pursued you in the hopes of a romantic relationship. these guys listened to your problems, took interest in your day, and cared about your needs to show you they can be a good partner. but it's not the same as a platonic friendship. if you friendzone a guy like this, he will do one of two things: 

1) stick around with either the hopes you'll change your mind (super common) or because he feels he can quickly move on and be genuine friends (rare)

2) not talk to you again because he doesn't want to hear about you seeing other guys or hear about your boy problems.

mini update: i'll probably give a full update later but here is what happened so far. i go to my daughter's room after dinner and begin talking with her. ""hey. i'm really sorry that i hurt you by the words i said. and i am really your dad. i changed your diapers, i met your boyfriend, and i plan on helping you through college. and plus i'm legally your dad, so we're stuck together. but seriously, i'm going to love you like my daughter even if you don't think i'm your dad. then i hugged her. she did start to cry. i assume that's good.",3
"update: i fucked up by not knowing the guy i like works on the same floor as me and telling my friend loudly that, ""he could fuck me in the ass."". link to og post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/

two months ago, i fucked up. i was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. i ended up realizing, not in a way that i wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab i work at. 

basically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and i were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when i said, ""i would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to..."" he overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. i was so fucking mortified. 

i didn't come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. that didn't happen. on my first day back, i was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. ""oh fuck,"" i had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that i ought to apologize for my crass comment. but instead, i frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if i do that, he can't see me right? that didn't happen again. instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said ""hey my name, how was your break?"" 

i looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. he told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. he didn't bring up what happened either thank god. then he said something along the lines of, ""is that all your having for lunch?"" and i was like, ""uhm yeah, i was in a rush and forgot to pack something."" 

then he said, ""oh i was gonna go grab something to eat at a sandwich place near us, do you wanna come with?"" 

i was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. i tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so i said sure and we went. 

well. we ended up having a great lunch. inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, ""so tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think i spent staring at you?"" i literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, ""it has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? that has to mean i like you."" (btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). 

even with my shock, i managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. 

well, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! 

we have not done the butt stuff. he told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he's not into putting his dick in buttholes. looks like i will be retaining my butt virginity and i managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.

tl;dr: despite my fuck up, it all worked out. we're celebrating one month together tomorrow! also, i'm a girl (got two comments asking if i was).

"for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children. saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

a few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. her husband is a light black man. of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. the skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

i pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. she didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. i reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. neither has spoken to me since.

i've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes i feel bad about what happened. i just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because i would be devastated if i wasn't confident that i was the father of my future children. was i an asshole for asking privately?

edit- okay i get it i'm an asshole. i want to make it clear that i didn't think the triplets had different fathers. i'm not an idiot. i thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",3
"by buying everyone an ancestrydna kit and ruining christmas. earlier this year, ancestrydna had a sale on their kit. i thought it would be a great gift idea so i bought 6 of them for christmas presents. today my family got together to exchange presents for our christmas eve tradition, and i gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. 

as soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. she told us how she didn't want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. we explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. 

fast forward: our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. 

tl;dr i bought everyone in my family ancestrydna kit for christmas. my mom started freaking. now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. 

update:  thank you so much for all the love and support. my sisters, brother and i have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. no matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. 

update 2: christmas isn't ruined! my fu actually turned into a christmas miracle. turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. a good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. they never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. this is a christmas we will never forget. and yes, we are all excited to get our test results. merry christmas everyone!

"if you get a kitten, do use your hands for play so you can teach restraint when they are too rough. restraint is naturally learned in play with hands and littermates because the fun stops when a bite or scratch is too much. adult cats who didn't play this way are more likely to scratch or bite.. obviously this only works if you shout loudly (""oww!"") and stop playing if a bite or scratch is too hard.

i've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. for example, i have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and i can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. but once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

similarly, there was i time i had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. this goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.",8
"by cumming into a coconut. edit: i got an ama thread now. help me: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu


this didn't happen today but quite a few years back. for obvious reasons i'm using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. 

-------------------------

anyway, around 8 years back i lived in northern mozambique, a coastal southern african country with quite a warm climate. my mother at the time was going through a 'health nut' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. one of these was coconuts. she would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.


anyway, being a horny teenager i fapped in regular intervals. unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and i was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. one day i hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. honestly to this day i can't fathom why i thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. 


i end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. i decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. i fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so i blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. 

--------------------

for the next week the coconut is my saviour. whenever i want to get off i simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. it's heaven. now before i continue i'd best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn't really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would ""go away in the winter"". 


about a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (i had been using it pretty much every day since then) i begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. must be the coconut right? so i decide that i'll fuck it once more before i throw it out and get a new one.


**worst mistake i have ever made.**


you see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. as i penetrate the coconut one last time i begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. puzzled, i pull my cock out to discover that it is covered in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *teeming with tiny fucking maggots*. they were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. 


i screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck i was doing with my life. 


**never again. never again.**


tl;dr don't fuck coconuts.

"a marriage.  obligatory this didn't happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.

 so i sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. i live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... so common that i sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.

 one particular day i dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that i had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. so as we arrive i mention this to the rider:

me - hey i just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago

rider- no, must be the wrong house

me- nope, he walked right out of that side door. i dropped him off at *names local bar* his girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (i had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn't mention this to the rider) you guys having a family/friend vacation?

rider- this is a family owned home, it's been in my family for years and we don't rent it out. nobody lives here but me and my wife and i've been in ny for work for the past 4 days. 

awkward silence as we both come to the realization. 

he got out and i drove away scolding myself for having such a big mouth. 

tldr- i may have ruined a marriage by trying to make small talk with my big mouth

"my son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family. i'm going to preface this by saying i love all three of my sons equally. they are 29, 24 and 22. it is my unequivocal truth.

it's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

after years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and i have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. we let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

i disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but i have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

after losing literally everything after my divorce, i have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. all three of our sons work in the business.

a week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. i was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. my oldest son managed to see it.

our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. my oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

i feel like i have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. my ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

if she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

the plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

my son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. he stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and i. our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

i am devastated. i have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him i want the will to be changed to split everything equally. but the damage is done.

he's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). his brothers and my wife and i are so hurt hearing this. it couldn't be any further than the truth. it's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

he has refused to come in to work since the past week and i've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

i don't know how to fix this. he won't take my calls.

my ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on facebook that i am considering legal action over. but i know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

i'm not sure how to salvage this. and i am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. my younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. it's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. my wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

tl;dr my oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. but now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after i have tried to fix it.",7

"my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her because she wanted to keep the baby. really, really shit situation.

2 months ago, my gf was raped. it was done in a park. she didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. i couldn't force her, so i just stayed with her.

she was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and i've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. we went to therapy, and she knows i'm there for her. she has a history of depression, and i've been really worried.

last week, we found out she was pregnant. i was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. so the baby definitely isn't mine. she is 100% sure it's the rapist's.

so we had a discussion. she is a devout catholic. we initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.

i flat out told her that i would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. she cried and begged me not to leave. i told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and i leave, or she aborts the baby and i stay. i would not let this go.

she didn't want either of those things to happen, so i told her we were done...

"i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. throwaway, because reasons.

tl;dr: found my gym socks in the garbage covered in poop. asked girlfriend about it. she started yelling at me and crying and left.

i don't even know where to start with this. i'm dumbfounded. she just stormed out the house and i'm sitting on the bed asking myself a lot of questions.

i live a pretty normal life, and i thought so did my girlfriend. we've been together for a few months and after things got serious, we moved in together. we started sharing a lot of the household responsibilities, but the one thing she was adamant on doing was the laundry. she would come home and find me in the bedroom getting the laundry together and would quickly ask me to go do something else. i'd come back to finish the laundry and she would have already started it. i always thought it was sweet and never her job to do it alone, but hey, if it makes her happy to do it all the time, i wouldn't stop her.

this is where it takes a turn for the weird. i keep all my socks and underwear in the bottom drawer of my dresser. i also go to the gym frequently, so i always keep a good supply of clean gym socks ready to go. i never kept count, but i know by just a visual glance i several pairs. this morning when i went to grab a fresh pair to pack for the gym, i noticed there were several dress socks, but no gym socks. again, not weird, they must have been in the laundry. i went to check the laundry basket and it was empty, so i checked the washing machine and dryer. both were empty. i couldn't figure out where all of my gym socks had gone. so, i did the very natural thing of asking my girlfriend what had happened to them. after all, she is the one who does the laundry all the time. she went silent, turned red and ran out of the room. when i went after her to see if she was okay she wouldn't talk to me. i told her i wasn't mad, i was just looking for my socks. she kinda mumbled ""i'll don't know."" i still wasn't mad, of course, but i was super confused. socks just don't disappear. so i asked her again, even laughed about it and she just looked at me and got mad and said ""i'll buy you new ones!""

the first thought that went through my head was she had somehow managed to destroy my socks while washing them. i thought the sight of that was actually pretty funny, so i joked with her about ruining my socks. wrong. thing. to. say. she started immediately crying. like, full on sobbing. at this point i don't care about the socks anymore, i want to know what's wrong with my girlfriend. i sat down next to her on the bed and put my arm around her and asked her of she was okay. she just kept saying she was sorry and that she would buy me new socks. i tried assuring her again it was okay. even went so far as to say i would buy new socks and she didn't have to. i sat with her for a few minutes trying to calm her down and eventually had to get ready for work. i told her loved her and got my things together to leave for the day.

on my way out i grabbed the garbage to take outside. when i got outside i lifted the lid off the garbage can and i noticed a small plastic bag sitting on top of the garbage already in there. i could see through the bag (kind of the semi see through ones) there were socks in the bag. since i was sure she had somehow managed to ruin the socks washing them, i wanted to see for myself. i opened the bag and immediately regretted my choice. there, inside the bag, were several pairs of my gym socks covered in what looked like poop. as soon as the smell hit me i knew it was poop.

1. we don't own any pets.
2. we don't have any kids.
3. whose poop was on my socks?

work could wait. i couldn't go the rest of the day wondering why my gym socks were covered in poop and inside a plastic bag in the garbage can. i grabbed the bag and walked back inside. as soon as my girlfriend saw the bag she flipped out and started yelling at me. she said i shouldn't be going through the garbage and that i was disgusting for bringing it back into the house. i asked her to calm down and that i just wanted an answer as to why there was poop on my socks. i wasn't blaming her of anything, but she started accusing me of blaming her. that's when it clicked. i don't know what it was that lead me to ask this, but everything leading up to this moment had just been so crazy. i asked her ""is this your poop?"" she started sobbing again and ran out of the house. i didn't go after her this time.

so, now i am sitting on my bed with a bag a poopy socks on the floor and a lot of questions in my head. the only conclusion is that she used them after going to the bathroom. which that alone has its own set of questions above everything else. i sent her text asking her to come back. she hasn't responded yet. i don't even know what i'm going to say when (if) she gets back.

update:

i had to leave for work and am now at work. yes, i threw away the bag of poopy socks. she texted me back and she's clearly embarrassed, but felt she owed me an explanation. she said she didn't want to talk about it in person and that we could discuss it over texting and to not bring it up in person. i'm condensing the conversation and filling in some gaps as best as i can. her responses are super short, but i'm getting the idea.

i flat out asked her if it was a fetish. it is not a fetish. she confessed to using the socks after going to the bathroom. i found the reason she always does the laundry is because she was hiding the fact that she uses socks to wipe with, primarily her own. i had no reason to question the amount of socks she ever has because who pays attention to that kind of thing? she thought i would notice and think it was weird since she doesn't own many socks. she admitted she has done this for a long time. her reasoning, as best as i can understand, is that because she is a germaphobe (her word) and she is afraid toilet paper will tear and is afraid of getting her hands messy in any way. she uses socks because it covers her entire hand. after she's done with them, she throws them away. she used mine because she didn't have other socks.  

so, my girlfriend has a fear of getting poop on her hands so she wipes with socks, and has done so for a lone time. it could be worse, i guess. i hope we can laugh about this later. i'm trying to find the humor in it now, but i'm still weirded out.

"telling people who have severe facial deformities that they're beautiful is disingenuous, patronizing, dishonest, and self-congratulatory.. there's a youtuber named nikki lilly who does music and makeup videos on youtube. she looks like this(https://i.imgur.com/hqmuqng.jpg).

if you go to the comments section of any of her videos, you see hundreds or thousands of comments that are telling her how beautiful she is. there are rarely any other kind of comments as far as i can tell.

now, this kind of strikes me as similar to telling an overweight woman that she is skinny. by no societal standards in the world that i can imagine would this girl be considered physically beautiful. she has a condition that causes her to have a severe and grotesque deformity on half of her face. she doesn't deserve to be bullied for this, of course. but i think the millions of fans she has and these thousands of comments are no coincidence. i think her appearance is the reason for her popularity, and so people view her as a freakshow, just of a different kind. people flock to her to her channel since they see her as a freakshow, but they just leave patronizing comments telling her how beautiful she is so they and everyone who upvotes them can feel good about themselves.

i see this as extremely strange behavior. it's almost as if nikki is some sort of ""moral well"" from which people can draw in order to feel good about themselves and others, to have an unspoken, massive communal back-patting party in the comments about how good they all are as people. her videos have thousands or tens of thousands of comments. people know the creator of the video will probably not see the comments, however they *do* know that other people will. that's why they leave these comments.

this is a bizarre new kind of phenomenon, and while i'm always happy for a fellow youtuber getting attention on their channel, i don't think this is a good kind of attention. i think it's actually a very disingenuous and off-putting kind of trend. it leaves me feeling very dirty and confused about the nature of social media.

it wouldn't be so bad if the comments were just normal, mildly supportive or even constructive comments, but these comments are really exaggerated. all caps, dozens of heart emojis, lots of exclamation points. it's almost as if they're trying to one-up each other for who can be the most overwhelmingly supportive and saccharine with their comments. it's actually kind of disgusting. i don't even know if we have words for this kind of behavior, since this is kind of a new phenomenon.

really, i just feel sorry for this girl. i wonder if she understands what's going on.

edit: there are a lot of people talking about the subjective quality of beauty. in case it's unclear, i'm talking about the physical attractiveness of someone's face, which has a basis in science(https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/social-instincts/201507/what-facial-features-do-men-really-find-attractive?collection=1077685). i understand that beauty as a poetic concept does indeed have a high degree of subjectivity, but that's not what i'm talking about. remember that nikki is primarily a makeup/beauty vlogger, so comments about her being beautiful are likely referring to her appearance.

"our first daughter was raped at 14 and we raised the baby as our own child. our first daughter committed suicide and we carried on raising the baby. my grandchild thinks we're her parents and i cant bring myself to tell her the truth even now. this is a lengthy confession. i'm sorry if you don't like reading long posts you can skip to the end if you want.

our first daughter was raped when she was 14. it destroyed her childhood and flipped our lives upside down. you always assume if you bring your child up right and take care of them nothing bad will happen, but something bad just happened anyway and there was nothing we could do afterwards to make what happened right. the man who did it got sent to jail eventually, but our daughter was never the same again. counseling never brought her smile back, nothing seemed to work. she seemed so cold and emotionally dead from there onward and we tried so hard to connect back with her but nobody could. she was an island and didn't want to talk to anyone about anything. we as parents blamed ourselves for this.

we ended up pulling our daughter out of school to home school her because her attendance was very bad and she suffered night terrors which kept her awake some nights. it was probably a bad decision and over protective parenting, but we wanted to protect her and felt a regular school wasn't a safe environment for her at the time. 

as if the situation could be any worse we found out our daughter was pregnant with the rapists child. we tried to suggest an abortion because of her age and the situation, but she didn't want to. our daughter refused to abort the pregnancy, so we kept her out of school to give birth to the baby. we raised the child as our 2nd daughter to give our 1st daughter the life she was robbed. we just wanted her to enjoy her life and told her we'd raise the baby for her as her sibling and she agreed to this.

it was partly out of fear of what the neighborhood would think, and partly out of wanting our daughter to continue having a normal teenage life. it wasn't ideal, but things worked for a time and our daughter got to see her daughter whenever she wanted, which was better than giving the baby up to adoption. things didn't last this way for long though as our daughter's mental health started to deteriorate. 

when our first daughter started to become heavily suicidal. there was nothing we could do because every time we tried to get closer to her she'd push us away worse than before. she was hospitalized several times for suicide attempts until she succeeded in committing suicide. this destroyed us. at first we hated the baby and blamed it. we blamed it for the death of our daughter and were in denial it was our fault. eventually though we realized we were to blame, not the child who was brought into the world by no fault of their own. we'd focused for so long on the fact it was half of the rapist's child, that we'd overlooked the fact it was also half of our daughter.

it took a lot of time to come to this conclusion, but we'd always looked after the baby out of respect to our daughter. the thought of giving it up to adoption went through my mind several times, but i knew my daughter didn't want this and so did my wife.

we gave her daughter, our daughter the best life we could. we bought her anything she could ever want, took her to concerts and on holidays. we even sent her to a private school despite the extra expense with hopes that she will become successful in life and live the life our daughter never got to live.

she is home right now and whenever she hugs me or my wife and says: ""i love you mom/dad"" it hurts like a dagger through our hearts. i always look towards my wife every time our daughter says it. she finds it as painful as i do and i can tell by the look in her eyes. it's not that we don't love her, it's that her entire life is being lived believing a lie. we're actually her grandparents and she has no idea of this. she's never asked if we're really her true parents because obviously she has never had a reason too. part of me though believes lying by omission is still lying though. we've never told her the truth about her sister being her mother.

she knows her sister committed suicide, but she is too young to remember her. i feel as though we're protecting her from being damaged and hurt by keeping her oblivious to all of this. maybe i'm just being selfish, maybe my wife is too. we just don't want to see her suffer.

the thought of her not being strong enough to hear the truth scares me the most. i know i shouldn't compare her to my other daughter, but i would never forgive myself if she committed suicide too after learning the truth. i cannot lose both of them, i can't survive another loss like this.

the whole situation is soul crushing. the only person i can talk to is my wife. it feels like some massive thing nobody else can ever know. not even our parents know the truth.",11
"by telling a stranger i can't wait to fuck them tonight. disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. i only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, ""what was your most embarrassing moment?""

so i was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing i would get fully sloshed at the party. she was right.

on the way home, i ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. she pulls her light blue jeep into the parking lot, i stumble out of the jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

i (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. ""i can't wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.""

i was not expecting to get hit in the face. i also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming i've ever heard in my life. instinctively, i covered up my face and wondered what the hell i said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

the screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so i couldn't really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when i heard, clear as a bell, ""you fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.""

whoa whoa whoa instant sobriety. i uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although i was in a blue jeep, it was not my gfs blue jeep. my gfs identical blue jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman's blue jeep. 

i finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. she convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. 

i did not fuck anyone that night. 

tl;dr: drunkenly got into the wrong car, assumed the driver was my gf, and told her i was going to fuck her",4
"the whole if ""you stay with your parents past 18 you are a loser"" needs to stop.. i got kicked out the day i turned 18. why? my parents think that should be the culture.

"i'm a 16 year old tasked with getting my senile 67 y/o father on food stamps, free government phones, etc and i need help.. for starters, thank you for reading and no need to write in layman's terms. 

**tldr**; my dad is physically and mentally unfit to get himself on government aid and my siblings have given me the job of helping my dad get on a plethora of government assistance plans. i need help doing so. 

my father is 67 years old and has tons of mental and physical issues. he has diabetes in addition to a wide range of mental issues we think he could have. he's never been professionally evaluated, but we think he has bi-polar disorder and is a paranoid schizophrenic.  he also has a tough time speaking due to his old age and not being a native speaker. i am the only one in the world that can decipher his jumbled language most of the time. he gets overwhelmed very easily and has a hard time remembering a lot of things. he currently has zero income and it's been that way for years. we think that he is being sent money from offshore relatives but no one can be certain. we are about to sell the house next month because he cannot afford to live in it any more. my parents are divorced and my dad has no legal custody of me. we live in wisconsin. i am willing to impersonate him on the phone with people. he is totally find with it since i have to do it for him all the time. 

task 1: get him a free phone service. he has a phone already so we just need a sim card with service. 

task 2: get him on food stamps

task 3: figure out what type of health insurance he has. i've asked him for the paperwork of his insurance and he doesn't know what i'm talking about so i need a way of finding out. he definitely has something i just don't know what. 

task 4: get him on social security if he's not on it already. i don't know how i would find out since it's the same deal with the health insurance. 

task 5: get him professionally evaluated for mental illness. also find out what government assistance is available to those who are disabled mentally. 

task 6: get assistance in buying pet food. he has a cat (which is one of the few things keeping him relatively sane) and needs help caring for him.

task 7: get him surgery for his arm. his bicep sags on one arm and he can barely use it. 

tasks 1-4 are really the essential ones. i just need to know where to start and what i need. this is pretty difficult in addition to school so that's why i am asking for so much help

thank you very much for those who read. please ask any more follow-up questions you have. 

by the way, this is a throwaway account because this post contains a lot of personal information. thanks again. 
edit: **thanks everyone for reading and replying. i will reply after school. **

"my wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary. tl;dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. brought flowers to wifes office. found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

yup. tl;dr  says it all. my (35m) wife (35f) and i were married ten years ago yesterday. she has been working on a big project for the last few months. the last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. this is a career maker for her.

 i work construction. with the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. so i work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. if its raining when i get up i dont go in. somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. i usually hit the gym for an hour or two. thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. we go home. i go to the gym as usual. i cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. we really havent seen much of each other this week. i went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. not unusual for past month. 

i stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. nichole was at the receptionist desk. i told her i got here later than i wanted could she put the flowers on mehgans desk. she said ""i dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" she buzzed the door to get back to the offices. the place was deserted. i went to her office, the door was closed . i always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. i walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. she is giggling only as she can. saying""we got to get this done"".  i am gut punched. i slammed the flowers down said ""happy anniversary"" and walked out. i didnt hear what she said just went past nichole said goodbye and left. made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

i balled my eyes out all the way home. went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. i drove about 2 hours to a state park. i had no idea what to do . i just had to run. i hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. i dont drink much so i had no booze, i just sat there thinking. looking back i am glad i was in a rush, normally i bring a 45cal. with me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. the way i was feeling i might have ate the barrel that night. my phone was blowing up fom mehgan so i had turned it off. i left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. i called him back. he said meghan called him to check on me, make sure i didnt do anything stupid. we talked a bit, told him i got to think this thru, would catch up on friday.

so while i am thinking about this, i go over our marriage from the beginning to see what i missed. we come from completely opposite backgrounds. my grandfather raised me with my mom. he taught me about life. he had a little saying about everyhing. he told me marriage would be the hardest job zi ever had, you had to work on it everyday. god i miss him. we did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. they worked hard and my brother and i did not miss out on anything we knew of.

mehgan was born into money. not overly rich but very comfortable. went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. and she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. i would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  we met hit off started dating. i was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. we dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. her dad and i started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

she graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. we work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. i took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. we agreed we had to experience the others interests. she was really enthused about the more physical things we did. i kinda like the symphony and such. i own two tuxes now.

i look back and do not see any red flags. her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. she was paraded out in front for photo ops. invited to conferences when other newbies were not. at dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. she quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . this 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. she seems very happy. we seemed very happy. 

so now, friday, i am home. i called her. asked where she was, back at work. i being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. she responded since i would not talk what was she to do? fair enough. she will be home in an hour. so i wait. i want to save our marriage. if i am lacking in providing then i want to fix it. i want to ask why of course but i can not accept  a idk answer. how do i phrase this? what else should i be asking? i know i will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  what she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. thank you in advance.",7

"x percent of y is equal to y percent of x. so, if you want to find out what 7% of 50 is, you could instead find out what 50% of 7 is, which is 3.5. this means that 7% of 50 is also equal to 3.5.. more examples: if you want to find out what 2% of 20 is, do 20% of 2 instead and you'll get 0.4. so, 2% of 20 also equals 0.4. 

or, 12% of 25 can be alternatively written out as 25% of 12 instead, which would be  3. 

explanation: commutative property. so, 0.07 times 50 will always equal 50 times 0.07.

i hope you found this interesting and/or helpful! 

**edit #1:** thank you for the gold! 

**edit #2:** you can also solve percentage problems by multiplying the two numbers (7 times 50, which equals 350), and then taking the product and dividing it by 100 (so the answer would be 3.5). thank you to everyone who pointed out this alternative method. ",8

"last month, i spent $770 eating out. this month, i've spent $42. this is only the first of many financial self control habits i'm trying to get myself into!. in my credit card's april-may billing cycle, i spent **$770** eating out as *one person.* i decided to track my spending in this area by putting all my meals i've been eating out on a credit card used only for that purpose. i looked at the end of the month and was absolutely dumbfounded at the amount of money i was spending eating out. i thought it might be $300ish dollars! 

anyway, i paid off the credit card (angrily) and made a vow i would eat at home at every possible meal i could for the foreseeable future. i've spent about $70 a week on groceries, (was about $50/week prior) so plus $42, i went from and $1000/mo food expense (how the ever living hell was i making ends meet with this?) to $322/mo. and the kicker is i still have tons of food leftover at the end of the week. the only two meals i bought this month were a bk chicken sandwich while i was on the road and a birthday meal for someone. 

it feels awesome to have a 70% reduction in spending in this area just due to self control. 

i'm planning on using this self control in other areas. next one is booze and cigarettes. then my shitty habit of mobile game micro transactions.

"for not telling my dad he isn't getting the inheritance he's expecting?. my mother died when i was 16. my dad married another woman two years later.

my grandparents, my dad's parents, hate my stepmother. i really don't like her either.

even after my half-siblings were born, my grandparents never warmed up to her.

my grandparents are quite wealthy. my father has been banking on this inheritance for a while. he has even been not paying into his retirement because he's so sure that he will inherit the millions.

i just found out on saturday that i'm getting the majority of my grandparents estate. my father is getting a token amount of $50000 so he can't dispute it.

my grandparents made me promise not to give out any money after and i intend to keep  my word.

"for leaving my wife by herself when she talks in a cringy manner. ever since we(27) had a baby, my wife had been talking like a baby herself.


rather than teaching the baby to talk like a person, it's as if my wife's language has become baby-like. she would make noises in between conversations like ""bo-dee-bo-dee-chooop"" and ""awowo-fwatata"", even when talking with adults. this is especially embarrassing when i am with her in public places, when she talks like that to complete strangers. 


i have been telling nicely to her to not do that but she would just laugh it off, totally oblivious to how people around us stare whenever she talk like a baby. i have to point out that she is not in the spectrum, just a crazy new mum, in fact too crazy sometimes.


it was a day off for us when we have my parents babysitting the baby and we finally have some time by ourselves. we went out for dinner and she done it again, talking to the waiter, something like this:


""yippy thanks ya-ha-ha-hah. owoyoyaya by the way can you give us an extra plate for this?""


seeing how the waiter staring at her as if she is some kind of mentality challenged. i rolled my eyes and told her:


""i am taking a break today and don't need another baby who cannot even talk properly to look after. please excuse me.""

i've since realized that the picture has been taken and used by several anti abortion groups. one facebook post alone has over 14k likes and 6k shares. a different group published his picture, our full names and some of the quotes that i gave to yahoo in a newsletter. i don't know if it was distributed in print or just electronically, or both. they ask people to join the $50 challenge in that article, and ask for donations of up to $5000. are they are using a picture i took for financial gain? also, imo, the article leads the reader to believe i support their cause. my husband and i are pro choice, however. i absolutely hate that my baby's face has been used in this way. i have no idea how many people the newsletter was sent to.

"for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?. my younger sister and i were very close when young but no so much now. i was born in fairly well to do hindu family. i fell in love and married a muslim man and had to convert to his religion. my family was pretty pissed off that i converted but we've kept in touch.

recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. my mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

my sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. i was happy for her.

it all began when i asked what religion he was. imagine my surprise when she said that he was hindu and the same community as our parents. this would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

i asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
i suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

i explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

she told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
at this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. she called me 'toxic'.

also,  check with the shelter staff about obedience training. they often know good schools or sometimes even do it in house. 

please adopt responsibly.

"update my landlord shut off the electricity in the middle of a heat wave. original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cg42cd/my_landlord_shut_off_the_electricity_in_the/

this happened in ny.

i'd like to thank everyone who replied to that post. it was very helpful.

after the post my so and i decided to get a hotel. when we came back this morning the power was back on. my neighbor told me what happened:

shortly after we'd left, someone in the building called 911 because their son was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion (he's fine now btw). the firefighters were curious as to why the power was off. long story short, after the kid was safe they had a nice talk with the landlord about endangering a child's life to save some money, and she was asked to turn the power back on.

the poor kid's parents have already begun complaints to the relevant authorities. i'll be meeting a lawyer tomorrow about breaking my lease.",2

thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

a long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. no one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. i told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). so the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

i am satisfied i guess, the entire situation seems extremely uncomfortable and akward. ",2
"meta: too many commenters advocate too quickly for people to leave their partners at the first sign of conflict, and this kind of thinking deprives many people of emotional growth.. i've become frustrated with how quick a lot of commenters are to encourage op's to leave their partners when a challenging experience is posted. while leaving a partner is a necessary action in some cases, just flippantly ending a relationship because conflicts arise is not only a dangerous thing to recommend to others, but it deprives people of the challenges necessary to grow and evolve as emotionally intelligent adults. 

when we muster the courage to face our relationship problems, and not run away, we develop deeper capacities for love, empathy, understanding, and communication. these capacities are absolutely critical for us as a generation to grow into mature, capable, and sensitive adults. 

encouraging people to exit relationships at the first sign of trouble is dangerous and immature, and a byproduct of our ""throw-away"" consumer society. i often get a feeling that many commenters don't have enough relationship experience to be giving such advise in the first place. 

please think twice before encouraging people to make drastic changes to their relationships; we should be encouraging greater communication and empathy as the first response to most conflicts. ",3
"by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter. this just happened last week. i got home from working out of town thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. ""beth"" comes in and i can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. she feels fine though. 

i am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. i wake beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. it is more than half closed and a little red. she still feels fine. as soon as the doctor opens, i call them and they tell us to come in.  

we get there and i go to check in. the receptionist that i have never seen looks at my daughter and says ""oh. my goodness, what happened?""  so i respond as a joke ""eh, she got out of line"".   

i know!  it's horrible. i'm sorry!  i have a weird sense of humor and i'm a bit socially awkward.  anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  soon we are called in. the checkup goes as expected. it's a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter zyrtec or benadryl.  then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

he comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. the doctor is angry. we all head to the doctor's office to talk.  

there is a policeman and a policewoman. the policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. my daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  so she says no and buries her face in my side.  the police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. i saw one of beth's cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. the doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

the police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. the doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. he just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  i now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  she makes an excuse and leaves the room. he says that he thinks he has to let her go. he says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. he says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

the police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if i can come to the station.  a friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

we get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   the police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. they say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  i call my wife who goes ballistic.  

the county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if i sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. my uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. i stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that i really don't need to make for this week.  i can't wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but i'm pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  

tl/dr:  made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.  

edit: spelling

edit 2:  update
thank you for the gold kind strangers.
wow this blew up.  i wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  i want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  for those of you saying that i am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) i will not be sleeping on the couch.  my wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  at least not at me.

2) i am heading home from boston tomorrow evening and i think everything should be resolved by then.

3) i will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  she was very young did not do this out of animosity. i do not know what if anything will happen to her job. i am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) the other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  a few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  these lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  the receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   the dep closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  it turned out to be nothing.",4
"checking my builder's home warranty saved me $38,000 on repairs. i bought a townhome in 2009 that i now use as a rental property. last summer when i was visiting the home i noticed the floor in the kitchen had sunk a couple inches. i'd heard previously from my neighbors that they'd had the same problem.

when i bought the home, the builder had given a 2/10 warranty which covered the any defects in the foundation for 10 years. i decided to pay the $200 to submit a claim and have them inspect, fully expecting they'd find some reason to deny my claim, but they didn't.

today i have a check in hand for $38,000 and a bid from a contractor to make the repairs. if i hadn't thought to check my warranty or if i'd waited even 6 months my warranty would have expired and i would be paying that out of my own pocket.

don't forget to check to see if your repairs are warrantied.",10
"update had a falling out with the girl i love and got served a cease and desist order. what can i legally do? michigan (x-post on r/relationships). past post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ebbq9/had_a_falling_out_with_the_girl_i_love_and_got/?st=j7t8o97k&sh=7aebba6a 

oh boy. i've been wondering for a while whether to post here again or not. i wasn't going to, but i know my last post ended up on a few other subreddits and i actually stumbled across it on my main account on r/niceguys and i read all the comments there. it was rough for me to read this original post, but it was a reminder of what my own mindset, and the mindset of so many men like me, was. i decided i needed to post again for some closure. i would have posted this on r/relationships, but they don't let you update posts they have taken down (yeah the mods there actually took down the post, not me). 

for those who didn't see my original post on r/relationships before it was removed, it included more detail than my last one here, so i'm going to link to a thread from r/niceguys from a few people saved the text of my relationships post in the comments. i want to take full accountability for everything, so i want to link it here:
 
https://www.reddit.com/r/niceguys/comments/6f696j/nice_guy_on_rlegaladvice_wants_to_know_his/?st=j7t8wz5j&sh=badbe0c6 

first, i want to assure everyone that i didn't contact that girl ever again. since i moved, i no longer see her or go anywhere by where she used to live, go to school, or work (i don't know if she still lives in the same area or goes to the same school. i have avoided getting any information about her at all). the way i acted and the way i hurt her and scared her so much still haunts me. part of me wants to track her down and apologize, but i know from my classes that 1. that can re-victimize her all over again; 2. it would be a selfish thing to do because it would be to clear my conscience, not make her feel better. if she wants to get closure by talking to me, i'm sure she can find me somehow; and 3. i don't want to make the mistake of using an apology to make her feel manipulated to talking to me again. i learned in my classes that men do that a lot. i don't want to hurt her anymore, so i will work past the guilt while never talking to her again. 

i was distraught after my last post here. i admit i came here looking for validation, not help. i had a warped sense of entitlement that led me to believe that no one would possibly disagree with me, but obviously, hundreds of people told me that i was fucked up, a predator, a stalker, and that i needed help. all of these people were right. i don't know what happened, but something clicked in me after seeing those comments (despite how combative and abusive i was in response to the comments). i checked myself into therapy in michigan the week after i posted here. i knew something was wrong, but i was still in denial. i thought i needed help with heartbreak. i didn't recognize that i actually needed help with identifying and combatting my messed up belief systems that i used to justify stalking and victimizing that poor girl. after a few sessions, i started seeing a psychiatrist too. i got on mood stabilizers and i started to realize that something was very very wrong with the way i was acting. something that couldn't be cured by medication. after talking it over with my therapist, i decided it would be best for me to move out of state into my aunt's house. within a month of me posting here, i had moved into her house. 

after moving, i started the process of transferring to a new school next semester, working full time, and continued to take my medication and was transferred to a new therapist. i had a fresh idea of the issues i wanted to work on in therapy, but after a few weeks of having two therapy sessions a week, my therapist pointed out to me during a session that i was still exhibiting the same kind of obsessive behaviors over women that earned me a cease and desist letter in michigan (though i wasn't stalking anyone at this point, i was just obsessing in my mind. which is still bad, but i wasn't actively victimizing anyone). i realize that in addition to therapy, i needed more help. my therapist pointed me to a class run by a local agency that was designed for men that have committed violent crimes against women like domestic violence, assault, sexual assault, stalking ect. most of the men in the class are court-ordered to go as a condition of their probation/parole, but you didn't have to be court ordered to go, so i signed up voluntarily. i attend a two-hour class session every week and have been attending for about a month now. the goal of the class is to help us recognize and change abusive/violent behaviors.  i know most of you are thinking: what kind of monsters can't recognize violent behavior? people like me. people like me in the last post. i look like a normal person. i grew up in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. monsters come in all shapes and sizes and i fooled myself by saying because i didn't ""look"" like an abuser or because i wasn't ""like"" the abusers i saw on tv, that i wasn't one. but i am. i can't take back what i've done, but i can promise myself i will never victimize anyone else again. 

in conclusion, a lot had changed for me in three and a half months. i want to say that i do not blame my behavior on my mental illness or anger or the media or whatever. i made a conscious decision to stalk and terrorize another human being because i thought i had the right to dictate how others interact with me. the class is a year-long class and i have only been in it for a month, but i have already learned so much. i have learned from my group that abuse is always a conscious choice and a learned behavior. but i believe that since i've learned this behavior and it's voluntary, it's totally within my control to change it. i've also learned from my group about the importance of having a non-romantic support system, so i made some male and female friends at work that invite me over to play video games with them. don't worry reddit, these are actual friends and not just people i am stalking or believe i am in love with (i talked about this extensively with my therapist and try to be cognizant of my obsessive tendencies). 

thank you to everyone who told it to me straight and i'm sorry for how i decided to treat everyone who was just trying to give me the advice i asked for.

**tl;dr**: i ceased, i desisted, and i got mental health help. thanks to everyone.

**edit**: wow, just wow. i didn't expect this response. i guess this is a top post of all time. 
i wanted to say some things for anyone who reads this in the future:

1. i read every single comment in r/bestoflegaladvice even though i didn't reply to many. i cried a lot while reading them. 

2. i didn't post this to be gilded or to be patted on the back. i'm not sure why i did it, but i don't think ""congrats"" is quite the right thing to say to me. i don't know if i deserve praise for being a normal human being with normal relationships. but thank you all for being so supportive anyway. 

3. i've had at least 10 people ask me for the name of the program i am in. the program i am in is specific to my area, so i'd rather not disclose the name. however, i encourage anyone who is concerned that they are controlling or abusive in their relationships with partners, family or friends to google ""batterer intervention programs in my area."" i did some research today about the class i am in and that is what these types of classes are called. they all operate a little differently based on where you live and what program you do, but we use stuff like the power and control wheel and there are steps in my program. there is no official federal program i don't think.

4. i am not healed. i have a lot of obsessive thoughts and i have to try really really hard to have appropriate boundaries. my meds have helped with this, but it is a behavior and thought process i need to change and that cant be done with pills. i have a lot of mental health issues (duh, based on my first post) but honestly what you saw was just the tip of the iceberg. i have never had real ""friends"" until the ones i have now. before jaime, i definitely engaged in stalking behaviors with both women i had crushes on and men i wanted to be friends with. it was never as bad as it was with jaime, but i still am sure i made people uncomfortable.  i also have some self-harm behaviors i am working out. so to the person who was worried that i would use all of the good praise to say ""oh i'm perfect now so i can do what i want,"" trust me, i know i am fucked up and i want to change. i want to have normal relationships and friendships. i want to not be known as ""that creepy kid"" at my new college. 

please get help if you need it. take it from me: all people are capable of changing for the positive. ",2
"equifax will allow consumers to lock & unlock their credit report for free for life. interim equifax ceo's message in wall street journal:

on behalf of equifax , i want to express my sincere and total apology to every consumer affected by our recent data breach. people across the country and around the world, including our friends and family members, put their trust in our company. we didn't live up to expectations.

we were hacked. that's the simple fact. but we compounded the problem with insufficient support for consumers. our website did not function as it should have, and our call center couldn't manage the volume of calls we received. answers to key consumer questions were too often delayed, incomplete or both. we know it's our job to earn back your trust.

we will act quickly and forcefully to correct our mistakes, while simultaneously developing a new approach to protecting consumer data. in the near term, our responsibility is to provide timely, reassuring support to every affected consumer. our longer-term plan is to give consumers the power to protect and control access to their personal credit data.

i was appointed equifax's interim chief executive officer on tuesday. i won't pretend to have figured out all the answers in two days. but i have been listening carefully to consumers and critics. i have heard the frustration and fear. i know we have to do a better job of helping you.

although we have made mistakes, we have successfully managed a tremendous volume of calls and clicks. and we're getting better each day. but it's not enough. i've told our team we have to do whatever it takes to upgrade the website and improve the call centers.

we have started work on our website, and i see significant signs of progress. i won't accept anything less than a superior process for consumers. we will make this site right or we will build another one from scratch. you have my word.

the same goes for the call centers. there is no excuse for delayed calls or agents who can't answer key questions. we will add agents and expand training until calls are answered promptly and knowledgeably. i will personally review a daily report on their operations.

we will also extend the services we are offering consumers. we have heard your concern that the window to sign up for free credit freezes with equifax is too brief, so we are extending the deadline to the end of january. likewise, we are extending the sign-up period for trustedid premier, the complimentary package we are offering all u.s. consumers, through the end of january.

we hope these immediate actions will go a long way toward addressing the concerns we are hearing from consumers. we know they won't solve the larger problem. we have to see this breach as a turning point—not just for equifax, but for everyone interested in protecting personal data. consumers need the power to control access to personal data.

critics will say we are late to the party. but we have been studying and developing a potential solution for some time, as have others. now it is time to act.

so here is our commitment: by jan. 31, equifax will offer a new service allowing all consumers the option of controlling access to their personal credit data. the service we are developing will let consumers easily lock and unlock access to their equifax credit files. you will be able to do this at will. it will be reliable, safe and simple. most significantly, the service will be offered free, for life.

with the extension of the complimentary trustedid package and free credit freezes into the new year, combined with the introduction of this new service by the end of january, we will be able to offer consumers both short- and long-term support for their personal data security.

there is no magic cure for data breaches. as we all know, every organization is at risk. when consumers have access to our new service, however, the cybercrime business will become a lot more difficult, and we are committed to doing what we can to help millions of consumers rest easier.

mr. rego barros is interim ceo of equifax.",10
"u.s. breaks up fake i.r.s. phone scam operation -- 21 people sentenced for up to 20 yrs, 32 in india indicted. some good news(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/business/irs-phone-scams-jeff-sessions.html) for those who have experienced this scam or know people who have been duped by the same: 

>with stiff sentences for 21 conspirators last week in the united states and a round of indictments in india, the justice department says it has broken up what appeared to be the nation's first large-scale, multinational telephone fraud operation.

>over four years, more than 15,000 victims in the united states lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to the sophisticated scam, and more than 50,000 individuals had their personal information misused, the department said friday. the money was routed through call centers in india back to the ringleaders in eight states.

>the fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. a person posing as an internal revenue service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.

>in an announcement on friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states — illinois, arizona, florida, california, alabama, new jersey and texas — were sentenced last week in houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.

>in addition, 32 contractors in india involving five call centers in ahmedabad, a city in western india, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.

as always, remain vigilant about supposed irs claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the irs. the irs never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. communication always begins over snail mail. hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations.

"i ghosted my boyfriend of 5 years.. i came over to his house one morning to surprise him with breakfast and a video game he wanted, only to find him naked, asleep, and  with his ex curled up in his arms.

i texted family members and close friends that we were no longer together and to block him on social media, as well. i didn't tell them why.

 i completely removed myself from him and didn't offer a shred of explanation or opportunity for dialogue. i disappeared from his life after his betrayal and i think it'll not only help me to focus on myself without his presence, but i think completely shutting myself off from him will hurt worse than anything when he thinks on how good he had it with me these last 5 years.",11

"i regret having my child. throwaway for obvious reasons.

i was married for 15 years to my high school sweetheart.  we had two beautiful kids (13 & 9).  for many reasons, we divorced.

skip to me starting to date again a year later.  i meet an amazing woman almost right away (first month of dating again).  we have a ton in common.  we fall in love very quickly.  she tells me early on that she wants kids.  i had never wanted more kids.  two was more than enough for me.  i had even made an appointment to get snipped later that year.  but this woman is perfect for me, and having kids is a dealbreaker for her.  so i decide i could do this all again - for her, for us.  

i'm approaching 40 when we finally start trying.  due to some health complications (she's over 35, and has high blood pressure), we ended up having to do ivf.  it worked, and we were pregnant soon afterwards.  but...

our son was born prematurely (they warned us this was a possibility due to her age/health).  he had to stay in the nicu for three months.  my new wife developed post partum due to the stress.  we found out our son had cerebral palsy.  a milder form, but he had it.  our world shifted from being a happy couple with a new baby to a depressed and stressed couple dealing with a child that has a life long disability.  this is not how i perceived my second chance at happiness was going to be.

i won't leave my wife.  and i will love and take care of our son forever.  but not a day goes by where i don't regret my decision to have more kids.  i should have listened to my gut from the beginning and called off the relationship early on.  she wanted kids, and i didn't.   but i did this for her.  now i'm depressed, financially strained, and my future isn't the relaxing one i pictured.  i can never tell my wife this of course.  and i feel bad even writing this to you all of you.  but i just needed to get it out.

"update iowa city threatening a lawsuit to get me to take down a website criticizing town odors. this is an update to https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7jubfl/iowa_city_threatening_a_lawsuit_to_get_me_to_take/

hello r/legaladvice,

a few months ago i posted here asking for advice after the city council of the town i live in sent a letter demanding that i take down a website critical of them, or else they'd sue me. most of the comments i received confirmed that, yes, this was violating my first amendment rights, and yes, i should seek a lawyer. 

so i did so. i set up a meeting with one of the two law firms here in town (the other law firm is the one that sent the letter), and he agreed with what everybody else had been telling me. however, he declined to represent me as he's largely a real estate attorney, and recommended i speak with someone ""outside the city's little sphere of influence"". 

skipping over unnecessary details, i met with the other lawyer, but wasn't able to afford representation at the time. i updated my website to be more fair to the city itself, but risked leaving in a few barbs toward the city council and the lawyers representing them -- borrowing a few reddit comments about "" squander taxpayer money on spurious advice and pointless legal services"". 😉

once i updated the website and the city realized i wasn't going to take it down, a different attorney from the city's law firm contacted me and wanted to chat over coffee. i went, although now i realize i probably should not have done so. he was very friendly, telling me he thinks the whole situation had been badly handled, but he made it clear that he thought i should take down the website because it was hurting the town and ""we both want what's best"" for it. he also told me there was a reporter from a newspaper calling around trying to get in touch with me, and he didn't think i should talk to them, again because it would damage the town. i declined the interview, because i was afraid i'd get sued (whether justified or not) if i said something the city didn't like.

of course, i was too naive to realize that the city themselves would have no problem talking to the reporter. so she ran her story, and i was made out to be the bad guy troublemaker by the city officials she interviewed. what's more, a city councilman, the mayor, and the city administrator all denied sending a letter to me. they were also quoted as saying ""there may be legal stuff coming down the road"".

a few weeks later i received *another* letter from the law firm, and this one was... weird. it was the attorney from the original letter writing ""on his own time"" to explain all the reasons he thinks he can sue me, citing several iowa judicial cases and going on about disparaging property. he told me i was making a stupid argument and attributing unfounded legal arguments to him. the letter ended by saying it wasn't a threat of litigation and not intended to deter me from exercising my legal rights.

this was around mid-january, 2018 (i received the first letter mid-december, 2017). everything was quiet, once again, for two more weeks, until i got an email from the legal director at the aclu of iowa. on the advice of reddit, i had emailed both the aclu and the eff, but after over a month with no response i had figured they were too busy to look at my case. i was very happy when she contacted me and wanted to talk.

i spoke with the director and, long story short, she thought what the city was doing to me was an egregious violation of my civil rights, and the aclu of iowa wanted to represent me in a lawsuit against the city. toward the end of february we filed suit in federal court, and by march 29th we settled the case after the city agreed to these five terms:

1. they had to agree to a permanent injunction where they can't threaten to sue me, or actually sue me, for any website or content i produce regarding the town.
2. they must pay legal damages to me.
3. they must pay attorney fees to the aclu.
4. they must write an apology letter to me.
5. my favorite part, the city's staff *and its attorneys* must take first amendment training.

all in all, i'm incredibly impressed with the aclu's work on this case. i know it's not typical to file a lawsuit and win a month later, but i think just shows how blatant their attempts to censor me were. i'm super grateful to the aclu for helping me with this, because as i said above, i wouldn't have been able to afford an attorney and the city would have gotten away with their threat. i'm also grateful to r/legaladvice for encouraging me to contact the aclu -- thank you for all of the help!",2

"police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him. this happened last week, he's only 11. at around 10am my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

they then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. the biggest issue is no one called us. not the school, not the police no one. we got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1pm).

we called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. we start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iphone and seen where he was and we headed there.

we got there at maybe 1:15pm and were completely stonewalled. no one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. he spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing nerf guns (this is important later).

we continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. she wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30pm and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7pm. they did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

we get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. they never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""creepers"" from their minecraft game. they painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

when they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. we've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

they kept offering him mcdonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. they asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. they kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

the school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. we can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. what the hell do we do?

edit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.",2

the double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/em28yfrmdfi?t=9

here's a youtube video of snl making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

there's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and ei is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is leagues apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. it would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

neither is acceptable. the double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is males who are underdeveloped for that age period. if there were a progressive victim stack, males should be ahead of females on the list because of the developmental delay.

edit 3: google the phrase ""science data brain girls mature 10 years"". i dont have time for idiocy, name calling, accusations, threats, etc, any or all of which are completely baseless or trolling. claiming i'm pro rape and pro pedophilia for denouncing both and also calling science into the equation as why ""its actually worse because boys are less mentally developed and thus more easily victimized"" is not support.

being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

for anyone who needs a heartwarming story after reading the abhorrent positivity towards this situation:

>i live in aus and about 11 years ago i used to be friends with a girl who was obsessed with america, so much so that she signed up to a camp leader in the us for one summer. she went over there an had an inappropriate 'romance' with a camp attendee. he was 15 and she was 20. the boys parents found out and had her charged. she went to a women's prison in iowa. her mother back in aus had to spend 30k on lawyers and fly over to the us to try and get her sent back home. she is now a registered sex offender and has to let every current and future employee know. she is not allowed to work with minors or vulnerable people. she is banned from ever travelling to the us. imo she got what she deserved.

update 2.5: there's been lots of debate about whether the sling is allowed or not. aa told me: 1) yes, medical devices are allowed. 2) i am protected under acaa and ada. 3) technically on aa you don't need to always make a ""special request"" to allow the device. in most cases, you can just tell the crew that it's a medical device and they should understand. but for extra safety it helps to make a note on your profile about it. 4) there should be no obstructive items in the way during takeoff and landing. however this particular aa representative said that the sling is ""not an obstructive item"".

amazon link for the curious: https://amzn.to/36xbjy3


update 2: aa called me, apologized for the fa ""escalating out of control"". they will open an internal investigation. i conveyed that i don't want the flight attendant to suffer or be fired - everyone has bad days and she works a thankless job. 😞 but that it's up to aa to decide how to discipline the employee and prevent this from happening again. i don't want anyone else to suffer this stupid nonsense. 

she assured me that i won't get arrested or banned, and gave me her email in case something does happen to me. 

**i did not ask for compensation and told her that i'm not here on a vengeance.** not here to make money or fame from aa. nope. did not make a dime from this and don't plan to. i will not be responding to media inquiries. https://imgflip.com/i/3f8i7p 

for those of you calling me obese and telling me to die - i'm a 120lb girl lol. i injured my foot and was hospitalized thus the sling. 

forgot to mention that the incident happened during the usual cabin check before takeoff. around me, some tray tables were still lowered, some backpacks not tucked completely under yet, some seatbelts not fastened yet. it's just that i talked back (""no i don't but okay"") and i regret that so much. 

halloween is over but she spooked me to the core. 

someone asked if it's a racial thing. i'm not white but it's probably not a related to race. 

many of you guys advised not to delete the post and keep it here in case this happens to someone else and they need answers. hope this helps.

update 1: thank you so much for your quick advice on a sunday morning! i memorized some of the lines you wrote below.

as we were about to land, the flight attendant handed me this slip of paper: https://imgur.com/a/t5neija

""the police will contact you when you get home. you will be banned from future flights."" 

""ok."" 

""oh i hope so."" as she walked away. 

i burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. she won. 

there was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my miranda rights. i made it home in one piece. still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future aa flights. i've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. my thanksgiving and holiday flights are both on aa. 

my seatmates were really nice and let me record their accounts of what happened. they gave me their business card in case i need a witness. 

thank you again for your helpful comments. i am not in jail (yet) at least!

original post: 

i can't believe this is happening to me. i'm flying from chicago to boston now and police are waiting for me when i land, so i don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

edit: i've looked all over the internet and can't find any faa rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

here's what happened:

..

i was on an american airlines flight from chicago to boston on november 3rd, 2019. because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, i use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. this sling is often advertised on facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. i am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""you have to put your feet on the ground!"" i cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""no i don't but okay."" as i put my feet down. emphasizing again. **i complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** although i had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights i've taken with my foot sling, i complied. i put my feet down immediately. 

even if it's technically not allowed by some rule i'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

she immediately escalated: 
""would you like to go back to the gate? we're gonna go back to the gate!"" and immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

but right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

she came back to my seat and barked: 
""police will be waiting for you when we land in boston.""

my seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. i had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no i don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

her statement caused me to panic inside. i'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

so i took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight.

"update: landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. good news!. well, here's my update! and with good news!

so first of all, i just wanted to say: wow. the amount of support i received, both in replies and in pms, was absolutely amazing. everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. the person who said ""sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

that said - i feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). he's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. he grew up in rural (arkansas, i think? that or alabama) and came to ma later in life. this was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. that, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

i know some of you were hoping i'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, i decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

yesterday i sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. he realized very quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. he also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. he just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

we ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if i weren't having the conversation with him i'd think he were a caricature). he's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so i think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". he seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. i reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

he still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. he seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. he agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which i will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

the past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. if things go well, i might even potentially renew the lease come september. i'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but i think i'll leave the issue where it lies for now. if this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, i'll go at him with everything i can in the future - but for now i'm satisfied. i'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",2

"for telling cashier that wasn't the girls credit card?. 
throwaway because husband told me i was ta and want to know before i get home and argue. on phone format is bad.

i was in a higher end department store today (rhymes with loomingtales) and happened to end up next to two teenage aged girls while shopping. one of the girls had picked out a pair of very expensive boots and they were both fawning over them. second girl must have looked at price tag and asks boots girl if she's really gonna spend that much on boots. girl with boots says something along the lines of ""it's fine i have my dads credit card i'm not paying "" which instantly caught my attention because thats not her card. i've told my son multiple times he's never allowed to use my card so i'm interested to see how this girl thinks she's going to get away with fraud but had split up from the girls at this point because they had found something else.

we end up at the same register (me behind) and i see her total hit well over four digits. the girl is about to swipe her card when i decide that i can't let her get away with something like this and someone has to parent this kid if no one else will. i tell cashier that isn't her card but her father's and i'm not sure she has permission. girl and friend turn and glare at me giving me possibly the dirtiest look i've ever seen. i swear this girl was going to throw a tantrum right there, i don't think she was ever told no.

girl tells cashier her father gave her the card to shop with because it's the stores credit card and it gives him the points. now that i've pointed out it wasn't hers cashier tells her she can't use that card. girl tries to show id to prove they have the same last name ( yeah that will help) and i tell her it's still fraud. girl says it's not fraud because she has permission and tells me to mind my own business. i tell her that it is my business that she's doing something illegal she needs to pay with her own card or i call the cops. girl is pissed now and people are glaring at me. she uses her own card and leaves crying. cashier looks mad at me and i tell my husband when i get home only for him to agree i was in the wrong.

"for pointing out to my friends that they are not famous?. my friends are dating, they're also actors who have had small roles on a few tv shows (i'm talking two lines or less). i say this not to be a hater, i truly am rooting for them, but to give you a scope of their reach. neither of them have a following in real life or on social media (they've got under 1500 followers combined). 

anyway last week i posted a group picture on instagram of people celebrating a friends birthday. everyone in the photo has got their arms around each other's shoulders. very platonic. 

anyway yesterday in a group chat between the three of us they asked me to take the photo down because they don't want ""the public"" to know they are dating. i would consider it if they looked bad/too sloppy drunk/etc. but they don't. also everyone has their arms around each other, not just them. 

anyway i asked what they meant, and they said they didn't want to end up in gossip rags....

i pointed out that they are not famous and that they don't even have functioning imdb pages. they were livid and called me a bunch of names. 

i think they're delusional but they've been texting me demanding it and even sent me screenshots of them reporting it (nothing has happened). at this point, i don't even want to be their friend. however, and probably because i'm an asshole, i don't want to delete it based solely on principle.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

ok so i first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200b;

so after a week of avoiding i came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. she was happy to see me and i told her to sit down because we need to talk.

i started things with saying that i know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. her face turned red and she started crying like hell. she knew what i was talking about. i told her the story about the dna test, about jennet and basically what i told you guys in the last post.

well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. she told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. he didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

she told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. when the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. after a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. as they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. she tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when i started crying. she started crying too. the couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. we were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. it took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(they came to their senses after a day or so). she reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. she made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

a few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. after so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. he met me a few times and i knew him as one of rose's old friends from the park. he helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. ironically i'm glad i got to know him before he passed, even if i didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200b;

btw, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200b;

so after hearing this i told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and i told her i understand she did the right thing. i pulled out an ""it's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and i headed off to my parents(adoptive) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200b;

i'm glad she is my mother. i feel for the first time in years - complete. i don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and i honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. thanks reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!",7

so on top of making porn i'm also an aspiring film editor and i am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but i also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us i'd been editing a new video, usually after editing i go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because i'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. we were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, i immediately said sure and led him into the office, now i could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and i kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. so i lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as i opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst i ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

i panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and i are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but i hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and i'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



tl;dr i unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

update: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so i'll explain, as i said earlier in the post i watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep i just shut the laptop without even thinking, i do this often (i know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. still haven't heard from her dad yet. i honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and i laugh a lot so thank you

update 2: thank you all for participating in a social experiment stay tuned",4
"i call fake orders in to a pizza place to get free pizzas.. my husband works at a popular pizza chain. we'll call it ""piece of butt"" for the sake of rhyming.
 if orders are messed up or carry out orders don't show, the employees get to take the food home. sometimes i order pizzas under fake names and give the numbers of local businesses as callback numbers, and then purposefully never show up to pay for it. 9 times out of 10 my husband brings home the pizza i ordered. this is sinful pizza, yes i know. but sin pizza tastes better than honest pizza, inexplicably.

wow, guys! i'm glad so many people found this entertaining. i'm glad to put a smile on anonymous internet faces. thanks for the gold and silver. my first gold! 
for those who say i am a ""pizza shit,"" why yes, yes i am. especially since i can afford to buy the pizza.. i hope i don't put peice of butt out of business, i'd feel so bad since they've treated my husband *so well* as an employee..

"for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 ford bronco i owned as a teenager?. so how to begin with this...i realize that on paper i am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations i'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even i did the right thing. 

when i was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 ford bronco. it was my true passion and i don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. plus my dad and i would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when i was teenager it was always that bronco that brought us back together. i made a huge mistake and sold the truck when i turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, i've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

we had a baby in early february. she is our first and the light of my life. my wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. i guess i need to say this. 

two weeks ago i was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. i stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. my dad and i had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so i just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't my bronco! 

i asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on i-25 as we spoke from colorado to buy it for $21000. i freaked out and asked him if i could buy it right then and there for $23000. he said if i could come up with the cash, yes. i had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so i had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, i maxed out my credit card to venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and i fucking drove away in my old car. it was like a dream come true. like a literal dream come true. it needs a lot of work i can't afford right now but it's mine. like in my driveway mine. again. i can't even describe what a joy this is. 

my wife and her parents are furious with me. they feel i was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. my point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. but this bronco means everything to me and if i wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. to me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

like i said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. how do you guys see it?

edit: had no idea this would go so one way. i guess i messed up. i talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. the $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever i need to restore it. she's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. sorry to get everyone so mad at me, i was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the ""mommy bailed you out"" comments really necessary ? i found a solution and it's coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it's not like i'm not paying for it on my own eventually.

edit 3: my inbox is so buried i have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. does anyone know what those are ?

edit4: i'm getting a 403 error whenever i try to respond, not sure what that means but i'm still reading because honestly i'm afraid to go home even with the great news i know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? i messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/snausagefest since you're a mod, do you know? i can't respond to any posts and get the ""status 403"" whenever i try. thanks!

edit in the morning: i couldn't figure out why i was getting so many private's  but i guess this must be locked now. i didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and said i found a buyer for the bronco. i'll figure out how to cross that bridge when i get there but my wife was so relieved that i ""had come to your senses"" i don't want to disappoint her. it's going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",3

"update mom had an affair 18 years ago, i 18m am the product of it. my dad just informed me of all this, and told me he will not pay for my college, while my siblings got their college experience paid by our dad.. the reaction to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ca66sv/mom_had_an_affair_18_years_ago_i_18m_am_the/) put an uncomfortable amount of pressure on me to write this update.

i am not sure if it's what's you want to hear, but things are more or less back to a ""normal"" state, if you consider other events.

unfortunately, my grandpa died at the beginning of this week, and i am still processing it.

i did manage to talk with both my mom and dad, and i know where i now stand in relation with them, as well as my siblings.

i am not sure i would have had the courage to say what i had to say if not for the amount of help and advice in the comments.

i think it is safe to say both my parents love me, and what happened two weeks ago was an overreaction to a fight between my parents. it makes me uncomfortable knowing i am not aware of my own environment, but a stranger in the comments can tell me what's happening in my life with only a few lines of text from my side. a lot of comments were spot on about what is happening in my life.

i have so far went through 40% (i estimate) of the comments, but i have given up, there are too many for me to keep up with.

the conclusion is that i am definitely going to college, it will be the college i have always wanted to go to, and i will have the same experience as my siblings. the money to pay for all this already exists, my family is not going bankrupt as suggested, my dad just had a mental breakup with all the issues around my grandpa and his fight with my mom.

even if my dad would have went through with his decision, my grandma let me know my grandpa left me and my siblings a sum we will have to split between the three of us, but enough to put me through college.

what started the entire scandal was poor timing on my part, my parents just had a fight, and then i showed up ""hey, pay for my college"".

my parents were talking about us, their children, and mom said something to the lines of ""to think you wanted to split up when i came back pregnant"", or something like that, i was not there, this is what she told me. i guess dad was talking how proud he was of his children, and mom wanted to express her ""gratitude"" for dad raising me as his own, and dad took it as ""the affair was the best decision i ever made"" or something like that. and their fight escalated from there, and mom told dad something like ""what makes you think any of them are yours"".

yeah, it went downhill from there fast. shortly after that my dumb face showed up, and here i am.

dad and mom have since made up, mom is still a mess, dad is not handling my grandpa's passing away too well either.

i did talk with my siblings, and my sister raised a storm and rode it here while blasting my parents on the phone, ha ha. my brother was calmer, but made his feelings known in no uncertain terms as well once he got back home.

my grandpa passing away sort of kept spirits calm, i guess, and shifted the focus to dealing with that.

reading the comments was a mind opening experience. i felt unprepared for the world out there. many have asked how i had no idea how to apply for loans or grants. well, in my defense, when you go year after year after year knowing you have nothing to worry about, that your college as good as paid for already, you don't really have to worry about anything else. of course i knew there are loans and other things students have to be aware of, but it didn't apply to me.

i went from ""i am going to college, can't wait"" to ""you're not my son and i will not pay for your college"" in less than 24 hours.

others have been prepared for this, at the very least they knew they had to get a loan, or get a job, look for a place to live, and so on. for me it was a sudden change in reality.

going through the comments i managed to put a list together with various ""tips and tricks"", what jobs are available for students, how to find a place to live, how to get a credit card, a bank account, a cell phone plan, and so on. really good stuff that i think, even after the return to normal, will help me.

my parents have been called more names then they go by, and that was uncomfortable to read, and i haven't even read all comments. i can't even imagine what else lies in the comments, waiting.

dad is very sorry, apologetic, about his reaction and behavior. i understand his reaction, but i still feel hurt by it. i understand he was not in the best place of mind, but i can't control my feelings either. we will be alright, and this hasn't irreparably damaged our relationship.

mom hasn't handled everything that well. but she is coming around, and she answered some more questions for me.

when mom had an affair years ago, and got pregnant with me, my parents started divorce. mom moved in with the man she had the affair with, but after a few months that guy decided he wants nothing to do with it. he kicked mom out, and she had nowhere to go. so my grandparents took her in, because she was still the mother of their ~~nephews~~ grand kids (i am getting a lot of heat for this ""mistake"", but know in my family's culture, grandparents call their grand kids nephews as well). mom and dad got back together, after a lot of work, dad took me as his own, and that's my life since then.

the man who is my natural father is not in the picture any more. dad didn't really know who he is, and mom hasn't heard or seen him ever since. he was fully aware mom was pregnant with his child, i guess he had more important things to do. but it doesn't sound like he was about to cure world hunger, she met him in a bar, not at a fund raiser.

and i don't feel a need to know any more about who he is. i thought about the matter the last two weeks, since i've been aware of everything, and haven't really felt a desire to know who he is, where he is, if he is still alive, if i have other siblings out there.

i was suggested to go and buy a dna kit from 23andme, maybe i can find him that way, but i think i will avoid doing this specifically so i don't find him or he finds me. as far as i care, i have a mom and dad and a brother and a sister, and that's my family.

moving forward i do plan of getting a job, and becoming more independent, but not in an attempt to distance myself from my family, but to feel like i would not be lost in the world if my family suddenly disappears.

my mom admits i've been babied way more than my siblings, and that they should have prepared me more for what's coming next.

i did learn where i stand with my family, and it's safe to say that i am loved, and i have options. i thought i am isolated, but my world is wider than i thought. grandparents, siblings, my aunt, my cousins, all have my back.

i think my parents are human, and they make mistakes, and even though this was not their greatest moment, i think i will look at everything as nothing more than a weak moment in an otherwise wonderful relationship.

thank you.

"for asking moms boyfriend to stop trying to parent me?. **edit: the boyfriend doesnt live with us and doesnt pay rent or bills. him and his daughtes spend time here and pay only for their food: something i do as well*** 

my dad died suddenly about a year ago, and my mom found this really nice guy that she's started seeing. i'm 23m and going into my final year of college. my moms boyfriend has two daughters ages 15 and 13. my mom has stepped in to be a mother figure to them, and the boyfriend has stepped into my extended family becoming everyone's favourite uncle. and while i'm glad everyone else is comfortable, i'm not. 

he isn't a bad guy, i'm just still grieving my father, and it feels like he's trying to replace him. he tries to set rules for me, things like chores and curfew, that my dad specifically didn't because he thought they were ridiculous for an adult. boyfriend thinks it's only fair because i have siblings now. i think it's ridiculous to have the same rules apply because of our age differences. 

he's trying to get me to share my stuff with his kids. they aren't lacking for anything but he thinks it's only fair because ~family~. 

i live in the basement of my moms house. i have since i was 15. when you come in the front door there's a door to the basement and the stairs to go into the house. so it's pretty separate. 

so last night i was dding for some friends and got home at 2 am. i had nothing to do until 3pm today since classes aren't until next week and my new job starts in 2 weeks. so this has never been a big deal with my parents. i shot my mom a text and went to bed. 

tonight though, man, boyfriend flipped. i got a lecture and sent to my room and ""possible loss of car privileges.""

i snapped and laid it out for him. i told him i'm leaving the city after i graduate, i told him i'm glad my mom found a new partner but that i am not and will not be looking for a new father figure and he needs to respect that. i told him our relationship won't be father/son for some time, and that he needs to respect me as an adult or that i won't want to have a relationship with him.

"by relaxing too much during a sensual massage. bit of back story. i started talking to a guy on reddit last week. we hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. we decided to meet for a date on friday. i have ibs and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. i was also very tired.

the fu: so i'm at this guy's house and i've made us a very nice mac n cheese. there was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. we're then snuggling on the sofa and i feel a big fart brewing. i'm hoping i can just absorb it back in to my body if i hold on to it long enough. 

we start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. i choose a 'relaxing' oil. i'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. he starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. i'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

i then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart i have ever expelled. the fart i was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. it was hella loud and it was hella long. and it was right on his balls. it was so forceful, they vibrated.

his response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'at least you didn't shit yourself'.

tldr: farted on a first date's balls.

"i faked my resume and now i'm in the shit........... throwaway account for obvious reasons. since i started high school, my parents stopped checking in on my grades and their mentality was basically ""we don't care as long as you get into a good university"" and they've carried on this mentality to when i got into college and they didn't really checked on my grades and gave me free rein as long as i majored in the subjected they wanted and graduated on time with good grades. well basically what happened was that i failed my first year and had to switch my major. i didn't tell them and they didn't ask so i thought as long as i got my shit together and not drop out i'll be fine. one day out of the blue last semester my dad asked me to write up a resume. i panicked and wrote up a resume but changed the gpa and major and made up some shit and thought i saved myself. welp, this winter break my dad dropped it on me and told me he knows people in a big company, he gave them my resume and everything and wanted me to intern there. so i am fucked. they'll probably figure it out and let my dad know and i'll probably get disowned or something, and best case scenario they don't check and give me the job, and i have to live with the guilt that i got a job that i didn't deserve cause of nepotism, this shit is depressing as fuck and i'm typically an easy going guy but this whole ordeal is giving me anxiety like nothing else. i feel like an ass for failing and lying to my family about it and now i'm on the verge of being blown and i thought maybe making a post here will make me feel better but i honestly don't know.

edit: wow this has blown up. in all my years of reddit, the post that gets blown up is a confession post with a throwaway account.. talk about a wake up call. anyways, i try to read all the comments i can. some of you tell me to play it off and fake it till i make it, some of you tell me to come clean, some tell me to just disassociate from my family and do my own thing, it seems reddit is just as conflicted as i am. i don't know what i'll do but i just want to say thank you to all that took the time to read and comment. i appreciate all the comments, even the harsh and brutally honest ones.",11

"by asking reddit which ethnic group to exterminate. today i had been looking forward to the qualifying for the formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing reddit whilst also watching some older formula 1 footage on youtube. so it got me wondering, ""some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they're just boring and far too controlled"". so i posed the question to /r/formula1 to ask their opinions also. shortly after posting, it transpired that the way i had asked the question could be perceived as...a little...'hitlerish'. check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. it somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. unfortunately for me, i am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that i must open every single one. it would actually play on my mind so badly that i wouldn't be able to sleep if i didn't open them, so i must open and read every goddamn comment. probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. i thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where i was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. but then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ usa woke up. and i've been playing catch-up ever since. took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. let's see what i go back to now...

edit: thank you for the gildings you're all giving me, it's rather overwhelming.

the original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/formula1 somehow. 

as of 19:42pm gmt, i still have over 600 responses to read through. i will be reading them all, but i won't necessarily be responding to them all.

i'm really glad that i could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn't the original intention, but it's a great positive to take away from this experience!

edit 2: update - at around 20:20pm gmt, i opened up alienblue on my ipad to read these comments faster than on the official reddit app, and when i started from there i had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, i now have 976 unread messages -.-

edit 3: update - it's now 21:09pm gmt, i did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it's back up in the 4 digits. i am seriously sleep deprived right now, i have been awake since 16:00pm yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. finally they've subsided and i'm feeling really tired now, so i shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. i honestly didn't think this post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. 

edit 4: finally i'm able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. back down under 1000 left to go now, and it's been a truly interesting experience. i didn't realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, i also didn't expect some of the truly deplorable messages i have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. it's 6:00am gmt here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!

edit 5: final edit, i'm now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17am. it's been great to see this happen, and i'm sorry to those who thought reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment

&#x200b;

super long post incoming so apologies in advance.

i wasn't going to bother with this update but after all the support and love i received from people in this sub i feel like the least i can do in return is give some closure for anyone wanting it. before i begin i just want to thank everyone who gave advice, i didn't respond to everyone but i read almost every response. i stopped reading my pm's because a lot of the messages i was getting were graphic and negative but i appreciate the few of you who were positive and helpful in your messages and i'm sorry if i didn't respond to you. now on to the update: 

it's been a crazy week and a lot has happened since our argument. my bf spent two nights at his sisters and during this time i decided to just send him a link to my reddit posts instead of writing him a letter. i felt like everything i needed to say was in those two threads and it would be good for him to read people's opinions. his sister read through them too and that started a massive argument between them that revealed some shocking information that led to my bf coming back home and completely breaking down. 

we spent the whole night talking where he revealed he's been using a lot of drugs recently and drinking a lot more to deal with his grief. he told me he feels responsible for his brothers death because while i was pushing for us to file for custody he was on the fence about the idea and now he feels his brother would still be alive if we had filed for custody over him when i first suggested it. he said because of this he's been developing a lot of feelings of resentment towards me (i don't really understand why and neither does he) which he recognises as being unjustified so he's been bottling them up along with everything else which essentially led to him flipping out when i brought up his tattoo. obviously i knew he was having a hard time dealing with his brother's death but i must have been viewing the world through rose coloured glasses because i never would have realised how bad it was if he hadn't told me. 

i was really hoping it wouldn't be the case but unfortunately a few of you redditors were right on the mark. he regrets the tattoo and discovering i wasn't happy with it either sent him over the edge into panic mode and he tried to use it as an excuse because the very idea of regretting the tattoo or wanting to get rid of it makes him feel even guiltier. truth is he hates the tattoo and he tries not to look at it at all. he apologised about a hundred times for reacting the way he did and for not considering he was making me look at the tattoo in general, as well as during sex. he completely understood where i was coming from when i brought it up, he just reacted the way he did because he essentially had a ""mental breakdown"" in his opinion. 

i apologised for my ""jack off"" comment. initially he was quite shocked and did take the comment as an insult but after reading the reddit post he understood what i meant and was very forgiving. he apologised for accusing me of never caring for his brother. 

we then talked about the argument he had with his sister... 

up until now i was under the impression that my bf went on his own to get the tattoo done, but it turns out his sister went with him to his first session and it was her who convinced him to get a portrait on his chest whereas my bf originally wanted to get a drawing of his brothers favorite stuffed animal. not only this but during their argument it came out that his sister wanted him to get such a drastic tattoo because she was hoping it would cause a rift between us. apparently she felt like i was tearing their family apart by trying to file for custody and she doesn't want me dating her brother anymore. 

if that sounds totally ridiculous to you, it's because it is. not defending her actions, what she's done is absolutely deplorable, but a history of mental illness bipolar/schizophrenia does run in their family. we're certain his sister suffers from bipolar disorder as well, or possibly something else, but she refuses to be diagnosed. 

my bf didn't go around to all our friends, that was his sister lying. she was the only one he told and he's promised to set the story straight for any family members she mentions it to. we've both apologised for what we said and we're going to stay together and work through things together. 

in the short term we're going to be getting in contact with a grief counsellor and try out some of the suggestions for how to make things less awkward in the bedroom. in the long term we're going to consult a tattoo artist to see what can be done in terms of lasering it off/turning it in to something else. bf doesn't feel comfortable lasering it off and currently his favorite idea is to get a heap more tattoos to try and make it less noticeable. i'm a fan of this idea as well. 

as for his sister, bf is currently debating whether to cut her out of his life or not. i don't think he should, i feel like he's lost enough family but i'll respect whatever decision he comes to. 

i think that just about wraps everything up. a huge thank you again to everyone for all your advice and help, it really helped me get through this horrible and awkward situation. 

i mean this in the nicest way possible when i say i hope i never have to post on this subreddit again. 

tl;dr - we both apologised for what we said in the heat of the moment. boyfriend revealed he regrets getting the tattoo and it was his sister who convinced him to get it in the hopes it would break us up. we're seeking grief counselling and considering getting more tattoos to make the current one less noticeable.",7

"for refusing to use the money i inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? she is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.. when i was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. in one split second, the happy family i knew was gone, and i went through the darkest time in my life.

my parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). she never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship i wanted to have with him. i eventually forgave my dad mostly because i was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. i talk to him but i want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

my mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which i now own and operate. i am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. he was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

this year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. the bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

the thing is, i don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when i think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and i have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. i'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. they are her parents after all. the only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""she is your sister"" and ""if she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""

#that ""half blurred nude"" everyone's talking about is rick astley. please, go ahead and ""depixelize"" it or whatever. 

#the other pixelized nudes are from a link about copyrighting your nudes. please read the post before commenting.

so a couple things have happened in the last few days, and i figured you guys would like to hear what the police finally settled on.

first, i'd like to clear up something first - the theft and distribution of this media was, in **no way, shape, or form**, the fault of my partner. he is just as much a victim of a crime as i am, if not more. this has been an emotionally tumultuous time for him. he is my partner and my foremost concern here is him. 

it's honestly absolutely terrible that so many people blamed him for this situation.

i spoke to a lawyer...and my dad. the lawyer is my father's friend who is giving me advice for free. **if** this goes to court, he'll be representing us.

anyways. monday, i got a call from a very polite female officer, asking if both my boyfriend and myself could come in to the station to make a criminal report. the first officer to phone me was mistaken - while this does fall under revenge porn, it doesn't fit ""sexploitation"". she would have had to actually coerce him into sex acts for that.

in my state, this is only a misdemeanor crime. *fortunately*, it's a charge for every imaged stolen/shared. it also matters that there are two victims.

the police spoke to the people whose names i provided, most of which confirmed that sarah had shared the photos. they'll be taking her phone as evidence and they'll ensure that the media is one hundred percent destroyed.

that all made both me and john happy, but as a lot of people pointed out, this stuff could easily already be on the internet.

(all of this has been approved by my partner, before anyone asks)

so i turned around and submitted copyrights for *all of it*. i spent a shitton of money copyrighting over a hundred images and videos. then i paid for a domain name and ""made"" a website - all it says is ""under construction"". then i registered john and myself on several different pornographic media hosting sites and posted ""content pending copyrights"".

then. i posted on facebook.

""recently, someone i consider a friend broke into john's phone and stole images. she then proceeded to share these images amongst some of my closest friends.

not only am i disappointed, hurt, and betrayed, but this person placed john in a very disturbing position - one where he had to defend himself from sexual assault accusations. this person did not come to me with these concerns, deciding that she would rather gossip with others under the guise of ""concern"".

had i actually been assaulted, this person would have been spreading horrible moments of my life to others, taking away my voice as a victim. how horrific, how absolutely *monstrous* does a person have to be to do something like that?

in actuality, this person stole intimate videos that were, in no way, intended for her. ""stolen"" is the best word for this media because, well...

most of you know me as an entrepreneur; i own a small business, i pick up freelance jobs, i dabble in several money making ventures. none of this is a consistent income, so john and i have been brainstorming on how i could possibly generate a passive income. 

so we started making pornographic media of a relatively popular kink. we had generated enough content to finally build an online following, and then our content was stolen and john's name was dragged through the dirt.

shame on all of you who has participated in this shit flinging and pot stirring. 

because of this person and all who participated, i have had to out john and myself as sex workers. i've had to speak to the police, a lawyer, my goddamn dad. shame on all of you.

from this point on, any person sharing these copyrighted images and videos will personally hear from my lawyer.

if anyone has legitimate concerns about my relationship, come to my goddamn face instead of spreading bullshit behind my back.

thank you.""

since then, i've been receiving non-stop calls and messages from people apologizing, asking questions, and, unsurprisingly, people are arguing about my expectation of privacy on facebook.

sarah tried to call but i hit ignore and texted her, ""you may contact my lawyer,"" and then gave her the number. she hasn't responded.

all in all, i'd say that things are looking up. sarah is, rightfully, being charged with a crime or twelve. john's name is clear legally. important people in my life know that i'm not being abused. 

people are reaching out to john to either apologize for misjudging the situation or to congratulate him on being a porn star.

so that's good, i guess.

i want to thank everyone who gave me good advice and urged me to go to the police and speak to a lawyer. 

edit: to everyone that is saying this is fake based on ""the timeline"", it *is* possible to speak to both a lawyer and the police in a four day period.

i submitted the copyrights online from my bed.

y'all are apparently just bad at adulting. i wasn't going to sit on my ass while my partner's name was sullied by horrible accusations.

i was, an still am, angry. so i got shit done.

*edit edit*: **i am not releasing the videos.**

**another edit**: since everybody is up in arms about me submitting copyright claims, this is where i got my information(https://saltyworld.net/how-to-copyright-your-nudes-to-avoid-revenge-porn/)

#final edit:

this is getting out of hand so i'll be logging off. people asked for an update, so they got it.

copied from a comment i posted:

nobody seems to understand that this isn't about getting sarah arrested.

my lawyer told me that, no, john could not get in trouble for what we're doing and, yes, i could go ahead and post on facebook to try to control the narrative. 

he *did not* give me advice on the criminal case because my interest wasn't - and still isn't - the criminal case. as of now, i've achieved everything i wished to do. the police are going to ensure that the videos get deleted.

i don't *give a fuck* if she's charged.",7

"reminder: paying rent is not ""throwing away money"". one thing i see over and over again on this sub is people thinking they need to buy a house because they are ""wasting"" money on rent. this is a fallacy and not the right way to think about rent. as human beings, there are several things we need to survive, including food and shelter. paying money for rent is no more a ""waste"" of money than paying for food is. 

while it is true that when you buy a home a portion of your monthly mortgage payment will be going to principal, and therefore you *are* paying yourself in some ways, however, the cost of home ownership is significant. some of the lesser known costs include the lack of flexibility, stress, the risk of home price declines, home maintenance, real estate taxes, and hoa fees. 

i recommend looking at the following calculator for a better idea of the true cost of home ownership. 

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/upshot/buy-rent-calculator.html?mcubz=0&_r=0

also keep in mind that this does not account for opportunity cost of being able to move (i.e. you find a job in another state that you can't take because you're underwater on your home or the burdensome costs to move closing costs).

edit: i think too many people in this thread are reading this post as saying that home ownership is bad. that is not at all the point. in many situations, owning a home is absolutely preferable financially to renting. the point is that a home is likely the most expensive thing you will ever buy; it is not a decision to be rushed into simply because you are ""wasting"" money on rent. it is *not* a waste of money to rent until you have the stability necessary in your life to make the decision to buy a home. there are even some markets or situations where it may never make sense to own a home, and that is okay.

"if someone doesn't appreciate something you do for them, it probably means that it isn't that important to them. rather than stew about it or demand recognition, just add it to the list of things you don't need to do anymore.. or, if it just needs to get done, suck it up, buttercup. we don't get gold stars for effort in real life.

an example of what i'm talking about here is that i used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  at first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  the answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether i do it or not. now i don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

i also noticed that i was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. people would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated i was doing it. i stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. now i only do it if i feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

these are all things *i* would appreciate if someone did *for me* but that doesn't mean everyone else feels the same way.",8
"(can) i'm 17 years old, stranded in a rural home, taking care of dozens of animals on a $50 per week income, for an undetermined amount of time. i'm completely lost.. so, twelve days ago, my great-grandma had a stroke. my grandmother, my legal caregiver, went to the local hospital (a ripe two hour drive away) and has stayed there ever since to ensure that the doctors don't take her mom off life support. my aunt, my other caregiver, and her kids went with her.

so long story short, i'm home alone. i've been home alone for over ten days and have had to take care of the family's two sheep, two goats, five dogs, three cats, six large birds, dozens of chickens/ducks/quails/guineas, two horses, and a rabbit to boot

the people taking care of me don't know when they'll be home. they're not gonna let the doctors let my grandma die so they're gonna stay there until she dies naturally or recovers, which could be months. i've expressed my concerns through text and have only been met with ""i don't knows"" and the like. they've come home twice (for a couple hours) just to check on things but aren't making money themselves so they haven't been able to help.

i'm basically taking care of a house and all these animals alone at 17.

i'm not sure what to do. eventually bills will start popping up and the animal are already low on food.

i have a weekly shift at mcdonalds to fund myself, but in the area i live, the bus to town runs very rarely so taking full time hours isn't an easy solution. 

i go to school as well since a school bus goes through my area. (though i'd be willing to drop out if needed)

**update:** thank you all for replying, i'll try to get through as many as i can but i honestly did not expect this to blow up like it did. anyway, i talked to my family and while they're not returning home, my aunt has come back with cat and dog food so the animals won't starve for now. she says she doesn't know how much longer they will be gone but don't anticipate it being months like they originally thought. i'm going off her words here. i also talked to my manager and am getting three evening shifts this week over my usual weekly one, so i'm not gonna be completely broke. the bus rarely comes through but i'm fine killing time in town if it means more money coming in. i won't drop out of school either. i was just panicked and assumed i'd have to work full time. i'll update more as events unfold",10
"this morning i (27m) found out my gf (27f) cheated on me, where to go from here?. so our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but i asked my boss if i could come in late as i had some stuff i had to do. however i went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. she gave me a key to her apartment and when i went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




as soon as i walked in she saw me and burst into tears. the guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. i freaked out at first and the guy left. she kept asking what are you doing here, i thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. i tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



i took the flowers and the gift and left. i'm sitting at work right now because if i went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





we've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. i was looking up rings. she said it's because i was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. she thought i wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. i asked if there were any others but she said no. idk what to believe at this point. 




the kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. we had lunch and got a hotel room together. we had dinner at my place with my folks and i dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. i trusted her for fucks sake.

"son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.. this has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. we sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. his allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

we had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. we even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

so we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and i can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. he continued to adamantly deny doing that and said mrs gave them to him. 

we then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? he's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""do not worry! this won't happen again"". we have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

then, the very next school day (the meeting was on friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. we figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. we send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. we get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? he should have known to ask to begin with. we are teachers not parents.""

we have no issues for a while until this week. some parent brought in pb&j sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. he forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". we find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. he was not given this one. we spent a day at the hospital.

we've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? the school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. he gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. this is in indiana, any help is appreciated.",2

extended family attended our family dinner. so all of our significant others, our cousins, aunts and uncles etc. during the dinner my elder sister and youngest brother got into a mild disagreement. my sister seemed (at least to me) to be coming across as very aggressive out of frustration and losing said argument. the two of them were too absorbed in their argument to realise the rest of us were getting a bit fed up.

eventually my sister got really fed up and said ""shut up, i'm not going to argue with a 22 year old virgin."" my brother hadn't done any personal attacks up until that point, it was completely unprovoked. i think it might have been the alcohol as my sister is a mean drunk. 

anyway, i immediately told my sister to grow up and that she was making an embarrassment of herself. she replied by saying everyone knows he's a virgin and she didn't say anything wrong. this annoyed me as my bro definitely has confidence issues and doesn't need to be made fun of like this.

so i responded by saying how she slept with well over a hundred men while she was in college, and that since everyone in the family knows this it's not a big deal right? turns out her husband didn't know this amazingly, i genuinely assumed he must have known. he left the party angrily saying my sister mislead him about her past.

"i held my boyfriend at gunpoint over a 8 hour period. i wanted to pull the trigger.. i was not in a good mental spot. it wasn't some big epic fight that started it. we had a disagreement and i flipped. i didn't black out, i was fully aware of my actions.

we were in a happy relationship, at that point 3 years in. i woke up one day and we had a little arguement over something i don't even remember now. he tried walking away to let me cool off and i lost it. i grabbed my gun, told him we were going to talk. i loaded it and held him at gunpoint in our bedroom for about 8 hours. i had never been violent before, no warning signs etc. he talked me out of it and instead of calling the police he got me the help i needed through medical professionals. 

i was diagnosed with ptsd, social anxiety and depression (possible stemming from the ptsd). 

he was there for me every step of the way, and the guilt i feel will never go away from my actions. life could of gone such a different way if i pulled the trigger. this was 10 years ago, and we are married and have 2 beautiful children. looking at us now, no one would imagine what happened. we never told anyone, and he stood by me at my darkest moment. 

mental health problems are real. instead of locking me away, and running for the hills he helped me when i needed it the most. the resulting life we are living together is more then i could have ever imagined. ",11
"for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?. i'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. i mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. she embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. personally, i have nothing against this at all. i am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. however, i do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. i don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

however, despite being a ""supporter,"" anna regularly comments on my body type. for example, i always bring food for my shifts since i personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). anna will often say things like, ""you should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""you look skinnier than last week. i told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" she'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if i was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that i look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" one time i was changing into my work shirt in the back and anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" i have no idea what that even means but i doubt it was a compliment.

these hypocritical comments have pissed me off. i enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and i enjoy working out and staying toned. anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. i don't think this is healthy. 

finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy i kinda like came in to get some food and i was super excited to see him. he turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. oh well. anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""maybe he's into curvier girls."" i basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. i asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. then i told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (i called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

she called me insecure and told me i was being a rude bitch. it was reaching the end of our shift so i clocked out early and left so i didn't have to argue with her more. i was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. she said that i was right and all but that i was insensitive in the way i brought it up and suggested that i apologize. i'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",3

companies need to get back to rewarding employees for their tenure. until they do, don't reward companies with your loyalty. when you're worth more on the open market than your company will give you, they are doing you a disservice and you should make the best decision for your own future and go make what you're worth. the more people who do this, the more likely companies will be to change and allow us to stick around and be compensated for it.

"subaru service center gave my car to someone else. final update

so i dropped my subaru wrx off to be serviced at a third party service center.  they called me to tell me my car was ready for pick up, when i arrived today i waited around 2 hours while they were getting my car ready for pickup to finally be told that they accidentally gave it to another customer.  they offered a rental car for the meantime until they can get it back which they said would hopefully be in the next few days.  should i take any action against them/is there any action i can take against them. 

<edit: i need to clarify a mistake i made earlier when posting this, they are not an official subaru service center as i previously thought.  they are just a third party service center, i have and do not want any hate going out towards subaru, they did nothing.  this was not their fault and i love their cars/company.  i will be posting a final update later tonight about how everything is ending.  thank you for the comments and suggestions.      

edit:

thank you all for all of the advice.  im not good with legal stuff and if i had not posted here i probably would have walked out paying for a rental car.  i called the cops and the employees got mad and stressed out immediately.  turns out one of the managers took it for a joyride and wrecked it which they admitted to while i called the cops.  i still have not seen it but i was told the damage was extensive and that i would be held liable for payment to fix part of it.  at this point im going to get a lawyer involved right? i shouldn't have to pay for anything they have messed up on.  even if they offer to cover fixing it im a little uneasy about  that.  now that it has been  in a collision is has much less value and could be prone to future problems.  they if i didn't get lawyers involved they would cut me a deal but im really not having that.  not to mention they have been lying to me for hours.

final update:
hey guys i just wanted to thank everyone once again for all of the support.  i did not expect this post to get so much attention and the comments have been super helpful.  little backstory, when i first bought the car in november the dealership hit a wall while bringing it to me and damaged the bumper.  that is what i was getting fixed.  that being said, in the end i will be getting a new 2019 wrx, i am pressing charges against the sm for theft, i have filed official complaints with the motor vehicle dealer board and the office of the attorney general consumer protection section, and i will be suing for and undisclosed but reasonably high amount.  luckily my lawyer was pro bono and my insurance covered the cost of the totaled car.  all in all i am walking away from this with more money and a nicer car than i started with and that is all thanks to you guys.  without this thread i would for sure be paying for that rental car right now.  for everyone dm'ing me and asking about what the location is, i am not at liberty now nor will i be in the future to publicly disclose their name.  it is part of the deal that my lawyer worked out.  thanks again everyone!

my location is washington dc

"by creating a special handshake with my daughter (nsfw?). this is an ongoing tifu, i am actively looking for ways to end it.

my daughter is 3. she is the light of my life and all that. because she isn't much for drinking or golf, i have had to find activities we both enjoy to pass the day. this means we spend a great deal of time watching movies. my favorite is e.t. and i figured she'd love it too. wrong. e.t. is terrifying to a little girl. in an effort to make e.t. fun, i taught her the fingertip touch ""ouch"" thing and then we watched that scene a few times in a row. it went well and now e.t. no longer scares her. win.

she has held onto the fingertip touch and it has taken on a life its own, a bit like a not-at-all-secret handshake for us. we always do it before she goes to sleep.

her: *puts out finger* finger!

me: *touches finger* ouch!

super cute right? well... she has now taken to doing it anywhere, at any time. it became pretty annoying and when i tried to curb the frequency of it, i was met with disaster. last weekend we were at the mall when she announced loudly in a quiet jewelry store that she was going to give me the finger. a little embarrassing but not too bad. i told her that she can't say it like that because ""the finger"" sometimes means something bad. she nods, understanding and the moment passes. a few days later, at dinner with my in-laws, the handshake returns to the forefront of her mind. mid-meal, she says, ""finger! oh no wait, that's bad..."" she then thinks for a moment and screams, ""daddy, finger me!"" if i could have turned into a flock of birds and flown away forever, i would have. my in-laws turn bright red and stare at her. i immediately say, ""no no, that's not what its called"". my daughter doubles down, ""yes! finger me! ouch! remember? ouch!"" i nearly passed out.

we are now trying to rebrand the handshake as ""et"" and ""ouch"" because jesus christ i can't take her anywhere.

"thanking god for something a human clearly did is a massive insult to that person.. i'm not sure if this is truly a massive unpopular opinion, but i've seen enough posts and comments online. i've had enough.

i have nothing against religion. you can believe whatever you (want to) believe in order to get through life and live your best one. however, critiquing others' - no matter how positively - by thanking a being we have no concrete proof exists for the doing of someone else is just a massive insult and injustice.

i've seen so many posts and comments on nice posts about how, for example, ""god is amazing for helping those doctors save that little girl, and for successfully giving her the surgery she needs"".

no. i don't care how real you think he is, god had nothing to do with that. those men and women went to many years of medical school - where they learned from and were taught by other professionals, not god - and paid many dollars to get to where they are. god did not guide that person's hand; skill, knowledge, training, and *their* muscles did. god did not come down from the heavens. god did not pick up a scalpel and fix your child. god did not do that surgery. *they did*. and saying that god did is a massive insult to that person because it negates everything they've done in order to save someone. it completely ignores the effort, time, money, and passion they put into their career and life in order to save someone else's. *especially* if that person is not religious.

sure. you can call it a miracle or god's work if you had just enough milk for your cereal or finished both the shampoo and conditioner at the same exact time. god didn't do that either, for all of *your* previous actions did, but whatever. it doesn't really matter because nobody did anything monumental and praise-worthy there.

but to say that god did something amazing like save a child's life, take down a school shooter, apprehend a thief, found a missing person, etc is just wrong. it's simply appalling and unfair, and blatantly discredits the actual people who went through many tiring, challenging, immense processes to give someone something amazing. you're giving the praise to a, quite frankly, fictional being rather than the physical ones that concretely and very obviously sacrificed so much for you. it's just wrong.

**small edit just to fix a word here and there, as well as clarify**: i recognize that starting this off with ""i have nothing against religion"" may seem counter-intuitive. but i don't have anything against religion as a whole; i have something against those who use religion to discredit others for their benefit, ignore reality, and praise someone who quite plainly didn't do the action that is getting praise. it's a simple matter of a lack of respect. additionally, i don't mean the common ""thank god!"" phrase - that's perfectly fine. what i mean is the active, continuous thanking of god versus those people involved in something amazing (such as *only* thanking god and not those involved, or simply making god the main focus of the gratitude). also, i gotta be that person as i don't know how to find who did it and thank them personally: thank you so much for my first ♪siiilver and gooold♪!!",6
"by having the best dream at the wrong time. i had the most vivid sex dream the other day. the kinda dream no one would want to wake up from. i was one of the founding members of the x-men, and i was balls deep in mutant pussy. so, fucking was literally my superpower. i could cure the sick with my cum. humans and mutants alike flocked to my cock. including the members of the x-men. so, in this dream, i was fucking blink and jubilee. sparks were flying in the bedroom. i mean, damn. i never really gave a fuck about these characters in real life. but deep down in dreamland, i gave *all* the fucks. i experienced the most explosive orgasm. i woke up at that moment.

oof. i was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. i'm not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. especially if you're wearing loose pants. i locked eyes with the passenger next to me. she wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. it had the words ""best mom ever"" on the pillow case. *of course it had*. at that point i realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. i was too embarrassed to really speak, but i managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. she shook her head as if to say ""don't mention it"". and then she said this fucking shit: 

""don't worry, you've said enough in your sleep""

""i'm sorry?""

""i have a son who's also into x-men""

*edit: appreciate the silver & gold! last time i checked i had like 5 comments and 3 upvotes. this, i did not see coming. thanks for all the responses, from the believers to the none believers, you're all equally entertaining! for those of you asking for photos of the pillow, once i got off the plane, i snatched my bags and rushed to the nearest bathroom, where i changed pants. once i did that, i tossed the pillow in the trash. an uber was waiting to take me straight to my new job. no fucking way was i gonna bring a ""best mom ever"" pillow into the new office. this fuck up needs no sequel.*

"for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiance that i cheated 9 years ago?. for reference, my brother connor is 19, i am 26, and my (now ex) fiance hunter is 28. also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. hunter and i were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when connor asked if we wanted to join them. i initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

we all got pretty drunk and connor had the idea of playing never have i ever. a few rounds in, the statement ""never have i ever cheated before"" came up.

now's a good time to mention that hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. his ex-fiance cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. and unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, i cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. it was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. this was almost a decade ago, i obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

well my brother knows about this so when i didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? you know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). you have to drink to that!""

my boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. i followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. i'm numb. i'm heartbroken. he was my everything and more and i still don't know how i'm going to move on.

connor tried to apologize, but i feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. this morning i served him an eviction notice. he begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. i just can't look at him right now. he ruined my life. after i raised him and cared for him like he was my own. i feel so hurt. am i being unreasonable?",3

"neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. for the past 7 months after moving in to my new house with my daughter and dogs the neighbors child who's 15/16 and has pretty severe downs syndrome has increasingly been entering my property and home.

at first i just talked to the neighbors and they were at first really sorry and vowed to monitor her more while she's in their backyard. however after a few months they just genuinely do not care anymore and brush it off.

i've installed security cameras in the backyard and front yard purely for my own safety insurance wise because we do have a pool. 

she will climb the fence into my yard (6' wooden privacy fence) with a ladder from their shed and let my dogs out. i've fixed her letting my dogs ""free"" as she says by using chains and padlocks on the two gates. before this became a common occurrence she even would let the dogs out of the house and then ""free"" them. 

numerous times if my garage door is open she will leave their backyard and just walk into my house to free my dogs. i don't know what the purpose is other than it's something she just has to do for whatever reason.

when she climbs into the backyard (sometimes when i'm not even home) and she cannot get back out she begins screaming and crying and just shuts down. before i started chaining and locking my gates because of her releasing my dogs her parents would just walk in and get her and leave. now since i've chained it they start a huge fit about me having her locked in my backyard and they have to climb the fence, bring the ladder over and carry her back over. somehow this is my fault.

now i'm not really blaming her because she mentally doesn't know any better, she has some very severe issues and she's damn lucky my dogs are super nice (purebred german shepard, an english bulldog and a mix sheppard/bulldog).

i just honestly worry about her safety in the backyard, climbing fences and her seemingly not being watched as she needs to be. i have a pool and if she falls in when i'm not home she could very well drown. that's why i installed security cameras to cover my own ass if that ever happens, i truly hope it never does but it seems her parents just put her in the backyard and that's it.

i've called the local child and family services office (cps) several times in the past two months to report it because i feel she is at risk with her parents inattentiveness and their seemingly not caring attitude of her just going into people's yards, garages, houses etc. i have a full garage of power tools, table saws etc that i've now had to resort to flipping the breaker off when i open the doors out of fear she may severely injure herself.

i feel like i've done everything i can, talked to the parents numerous times, called child and family services, installed cameras, locked my gates further. i just have no idea what to do now? i've debated calling the police when she enters but i don't know how that will escalate.",2
"returned a $1,175 computer back to walmart and they refuse to refund the money.. hi all! so i put a gaming comp on layaway with walmart a few weeks ago so i could make payments versus $1,000+ at once. 

i finally paid it off brought it home, and the motherboard was cracked. so i returned it, unfortunately they said that amount was too much for a gift card (as i was going to immediately buy a new one) but my mom has a walmart debit card they said it would be available to me immediately. 

well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. 

we did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn't good enough?? she said that it had a ""different balance"" on all the receipts but that's because it was layaway and i made payments!

sorry to disappear, nothing bad happened to me.

the good news is that i am not being kicked out, or disowned, etc.

thank you for all your support, everyone, i will follow through and call financial aid at my college in a few hours, and take it from there.

my grandpa had a stroke a week ago, and my dad is helping my grandma with setting up a live in nurse, so he wasn't around yesterday.

i will let you know how i manage.

thank you again.

pretty much the title. i have no idea how to process all this, and i am completely unprepared for what lies ahead :(

both my older brother and sister went to the same college. my brother graduated two years ago, my sister is set to graduate in two years. both had their college paid by our dad. dad paid all their college expenses, including rent, food, their cars, pocket money, you name it.

my brother has a job now, his own place, lives together with his fiancee, and has his life together.

my sister already has a good paying job, and my dad still pays for almost everything for her.

i got accepted to the same college, which was always the plan, and was looking forward to talk with my parents about the next steps, and ask them to help me the same they did for my siblings. i always assumed they had money put aside for my college the way they had for my siblings.

instead i was met with a story about my mom's cheating, how i am the result of her cheating, and how my dad is not willing to support me any more moving forward.

dad told me that mom had 18 years to let me know and prepare me for the future, but obviously she never did. he said it was never is place to say anything since i am not his son, and didn't want to interfere with mom's parenting.

apparently my grandparents know i am not dad's biological son, but they haven't bothered to tell me anything either.

my siblings had no idea, and they are as surprised as i am because there was never a hint of anything being off. i might be naive, but i always thought i had a great relationship with my dad. we go to see sports together, we go fishing together, he tutored me when i had difficulties with math (dad is an engineer), he taught me to drive. i never got a hint he stores resentment towards me. i mean, he gave me my name, and has explained what my name means, and he was very proud of it. it's a story he tells from time to time. he likes to talk about stuff like that about me.

my mom has never said a word about anything, and apparently she was supposed to have ""the talk"" with me, but she never did.

i feel abandoned and unprepared for what lies ahead. i am not even sure i will be able to go to college any more, i always assumed my parents will pay for it. i never had a job, and i am not sure what job i can even get to support me through college, i have no idea how to apply for loans.

all my mom has done is cry and apologize. but nothing of substance, she has no idea how to help me.

i don't even know if i am welcomed home any more, it's all up in the air, i feel shame leaving my room, and if i will be asked to move out i don't know where to go. i don't have any savings, maybe $400 put together.

i am angry at my mom, i am confused about where i stand with my dad. there's a man out there who is my father that never wanted to have anything to do with me. i feel rejected and i have no idea what to do to fix this situation.

anyone have any idea what to do here?

do i apologize to my dad? what do i say to him?

idk, i've been stuck in my room these past few days, reading and browsing reddit. i have no idea what to do.

"by hiding my staple addiction and making my family think i was a heroin junkie. ever since i was a kid, i loved to fiddle around with staplers. playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. one of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. there are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes i'd break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. i've even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.

&#x200b;

this progressed from me messing around with staples in ms. grady's second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. i had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? well...

&#x200b;

fast forward to present day. i am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. i have a home, a normal car, an office job. i am by all accounts a normal human being... **i still love staples.** working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. i'd spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. it got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.

&#x200b;

so i had to stop doing that...i turned to amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. it wasn't enough. i went to 20, then 40. my wife got curious then and asked ""why are you buying all of these boxes of staples"". but i brushed it off as a work issue that i'd get reimbursed for and knew i had to change my methods.

&#x200b;

over the course of a few months i enabled myself...i started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. i would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. i began to stay out late and tell my wife i would be home soon, so i could go buy more staples from different stores. i opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn't know but she caught it in the mail. she got suspicious because things weren't adding up.

&#x200b;

this past thursday after one of my ""late nights"" i get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. i walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. because it is.

my wife asked if there was anything i wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. i sat down and kept saying ""what are you talking about"" until my mom said ""honey, we saw the pictures"". then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. this man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me ""do something"" with what i had in the bag from multiple stores. it basically looked like i was a drug runner for office depot who was using some of the product for myself. at this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. i had to come clean and all i could muster was

&#x200b;

""i...i like staples.""

&#x200b;

the wtf looks i got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when i showed them my car....i came clean. i backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. right now my only concern is my dad. he didn't laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. 

&#x200b;

believe it or not, i think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. i may or may not do that, but the good news is i now can have a ""staple hour"" once i get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.

&#x200b;

tldr: i have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought i was on drugs when it became a problem.

edit: 

thank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! i am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. if you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, i just ask that you dm me/name the throwaway so i can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people's perspectives on my problem.

1. i went to see a therapist today with my wife. i was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, i do need help. i am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. just tailored to my specific issue.

2. apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. that included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. so after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.

3. my wife initially thought i was having an affair. she didn't think i was doing drugs until she got the pictures. the pi just told her what he saw, and she deduced that i had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. she admitted that she didn't think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.

4. i do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. i am just an addict, and an idiot. i know how stupid the addiction is and so i tried to hide it. it's not a big deal in the grand scheme of things i guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control.",4

"we decided not to buy a bearded dragon.. my wife and i were looking at getting a bearded dragon for our son for his birthday. a young beardie is only about $60. so we set aside $200 in our budget counting on buying a reptile aquarium and some incidentals. 

then we learned it needs expensive uv bulbs that last about 6 months and are about $40 each. also the electricity cost the run this heat 24 hours can be a drain on the electric bill. 

also the beardie needs to go to the vet every 6 months for a checkup. and finally, food. they have a very diverse diet and can eat up to $15 per week in foods. so i did a total cost analysis for a beardie that lives 12 years and it turned out to be a whopping $10,000 

life pro tip, do a total cost analysis on pets before deciding to purchase. even free pets are absurdly expensive. in 12 years both of my kids are going to be in college and i will desperately need $10,000 then. i will not need an aging lizard.

edit: for everyone giving me shit about my poor son, don't pity him. first he didn't know about the beardie. second we are taking that $200 and taking him to an amusement park. he's fine. 

edit 2: this post is not about ""don't buy pets, they're expensive."" the post is about ""make sure you're aware of the full cost of something before making a decision."" yes we have kids and dogs. yes they're more expensive than lizards, but for us well worth the cost. a reptile, not so much. 

edit 3: thank you all for the ""you're way overestimating"" and the ""you're way underestimating"" posts. the accuracy of the cost really isn't the issue. the issue is we were expecting something minimal and almost made a big mistake. the point is, we did the research and it was way more than we were expecting and wanting to pay. to us, it wasn't worth it. we have other pets. we aren't frugal, but we are smart with our money. i am simply encouraging others to do cost analysis. and at the end of the day if a bearded dragon is worth 10k to you, awesome! do it.

"my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help.. hi, everyone. this will probably be lengthy as i have nobody in my life to talk to about this. this is as much an advice thread as it is a place for me vent and it feels good to air this out.

my wife suffers from intense germophobia and anxiety. we have been together for 11 years and married for 8. she has not always been like this, she was relatively normal while we dated but it started to get worse after we got married. she previously worked at a hotel as a receptionist and was occasionally required to handle and wash guest towels. well, she ended up contracting a staph infection and had to be hospitalized to have the infection drained. following this, she had to be on antibiotics for 30 days. ever since that experience, her anxiety and fear of infection has steadily grown over the years up until this point. we also have two children - 2 year old boy and 5 year old girl - and her tendencies affect them, also.

the following list is my attempt at a comprehensive germ-prevention ""standard operating procedures"" of our household:

&#x200b;

* if i touch a light switch i need to wash my hands
* if i touch a door knob i need to wash my hands
* if i go to the garage i need to take a shower before i      can sit down or do anything
* if i touch her pajamas or i touch towels then i need to      take a shower
* if i *even enter* the guest bathroom then i have      to take a shower
* if my kids enter the guest bathroom they have to have a      bath
* i am not allowed to use her toilet in the master      bathroom
* she stops up her toilet everyday and requires me to      plunge and clean it (she uses 3x as much tp as a regular person would).      the cleaning process is 3 chlorox wipes - one for the seat, one for under,      and one to use to flush it with. i have to immediately shower after this.
* if she spills excess *water* on the floor then i      have to mop it and anywhere i walked to include the **entire** house if      that is where i walked after stepping in the water.
* she goes through entire loads of her pajamas daily just      trying to change her clothes. every time she uses the toilet, she has to      change her clothes. she washes her hands and arms up to her elbows and      then her face. if she gets water on her shirt, she will change it. if,      when putting on her shirt she touches it to her body, she will change it.      if her pants touch the floor when she is putting them on, she will change      them. she discards the top shirts in her drawer every time she gets      dressed. she uses 6-7 towels after a shower, discarding half of them      because ""they touched my chest."" as you can see, this adds up      and i end up folding laundry for 60-90 minutes everyday. this doesnt      include the time it takes to actually change it out and take showers.
* if i change out laundry and **i graze the doorframe** when i enter the bedroom with clothes, i have to discard all of them.
* if an article of clothing touches the edge of the bed, discard it.
* if i even *touch* the dishwasher i have to wash my      hands.
* if she takes a shower and gets in the bed, she will not      leave the bedroom or she considers herself dirty and would have to shower      again. this means if she is hungry or thirsty i will bring it to her.
* her showers last around 40 minutes. she bathes 3-4      times and washes her hair 2 times. our water bill is ridiculous.
* if my son (2 yo) takes one step outside of his playpen      then he has to have a bath before he can go in his bed. this includes      naps. if i take him outside (even just for *1 minutes*), he would      need a bath before he can get in his bed. not even changing his clothes      would suffice.
* when i clean the house (which i dont mind, btw.      cleaning your house is necessary), everything has to be done in a **very      specific order**. no deviations from this order or it has to be re done.

&#x200b;

1. change out laundry and leave washer free
2. wash hands, face, and arms and change clothes
3. sanitize all toys on floor and put away
4. pick up all clothes and put in baskets
5. sanitize all counters
6. clean kids bathroom
7. take out master bathroom trash, wash hands, replace bag
8. take out kids trash, wash hands, replace bag
9. take out kitchen trash, wash hands, replace bag
10. clean guest bathroom, wash hands, take out trash, wash      hands, replace bag
11. take shower
12. put bathroom rugs in washer
13. take shower
14. sweep entire house in a very specific order
15. mop house in very specific order
16. take shower

i want to make this clear - i have no problem with cleaning but i often do something in the wrong order or forget to wash my hands and i get berated. my wife has little patience for mistakes that involve germs. often, i have to clean the house late at night after the kids go to bed so i will be doing it after midnight. of course i will make mistakes when i am mentally exhausted.

&#x200b;

* if i bring her water, i have to wash my hands and then *hold      the cup over my head* as it clears the kitchen counter. she thinks that      if i hold her cup around my chest that it will touch the counter and be      dirty. i do the same thing with plates and utensils.
* if i have to discard a piece of clothing on the floor      in her vicinity, she will change her clothes and get pissed. she thinks      that the **air created when the clothing hits the floor will blow      bacteria all over her**. this is perhaps the one that triggers me the      most.
* if my dog gets out, he has to have a bath before he can      come back. he gets out often because she wont close the door.
* my wife **will not touch doorknobs**. she uses her      foot to close the door and she will just fucking leave it open over      actually closing it - even when she leaves the house.
* if i leave the house with my phone, i cannot bring it      back into the house until i sanitize it. that includes washing the phone      case with soap and water and then using alcohol on the phone.
* no shoes on the in house, ever. i had contractors over      a month ago and they wore shoes. i had to sanitize every object they      touched, and mop twice where they walked.
* her depth perception is abysmal. we get in so many      fights because she thinks that i touched her with a dirty object when i      was *halfway across the room.* when she gets dressed, i half to watch      her and verify that she doesnt touch her body with the outside of the      shirt. same with pants.
* we never have people over because of her fear of      infection. plus, i am the one who has to clean and sanitize so i am      reluctant to even mention hosting an event or having a party at the house.

there is more things i have to deal with but i cannot remember every situation right now. the worst of it for me is the constant laundry (3-4 loads a day - sometimes more) and showers (4-5 showers a day). i have taken as many as **9** showers in one day and as many as **35** showers in one week. i wash my hands over 50 times a day. i have gotten to the point where i just pretend to take a shower or wash my hands if she isnt in the room. i fantasize about just being able to get through my day not feeling like a puppet on a string. i get no sleep (maybe 4-5 hours on average) and have almost no free time. and this is not because of my kids.

you may be thinking, ""dude, go to marriage counseling."" we did that about two months ago. my dad may be the only person who really knows what i am going through he told me to be completely honest - hold nothing back. that is exactly what i did. i told the counselor everything that i just revealed to all of you. i have had this talk with my wife already but she says, ""you can leave at anytime, if you cant handle it you dont have to be here."" the counselor was speechless for a second but then began to address my wife and asking her if it was all true. my wife just shutdown and barely refused to acknowledge it. after the session, my wife got upset at me for ""throwing her under the bus"" and canceled all future sessions.

i want to say one last thing. before she went deep into this fear of infection, we had a great relationship. we loved each other and felt we were meant to be. i still love her and want it to work. i have been dealing with the worst of this for nearly 3 years now. i am physically and mentally exhausted. i have thought of leaving multiple times but i am afraid of how it will affect my kids. we also bought a huge house and invested sums of money into it that we would lose. my wife refuses to take medication for her anxiety (i dont blame her, most of it hasnt worked in the past).

has anyone ever been in situation similar to this? thank you for taking the time to read and i appreciate any and all advice.

**tl;dr** \- my wife suffers from extreme germophobia and it severely complicates my life and my childrens' lives.

&#x200b;

edit:  i want to make something clear.  my children take 1 bath a day (sometimes two).  they dont do what i do - that is the one thing i absolutely fucking put my foot down on.  but yeah, they need out of this situation asap.  i talked to my wife a few minutes ago and let her know exactly how i feel - again.  she broke down, as expected, and ended our conversation.  when i get home we will continue to address this.

"by getting reddit banned in russia. today reddit was blocked in russia, and i am the one who posted this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/%d0%bc%d0%b8%d0%bd%d0%b8%d0%bc%d0%b0%d0%bb%d1%8c%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%b8_%d0%bd%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%b6%d0%bd%d1%8b%d0%b9_%d0%bc%d0%b5%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b4_%d0%b2%d1%8b%d1%80%d0%b0%d1%89%d0%b8%d0%b2%d0%b0%d0%bd%d0%b8%d1%8f_%d0%bf%d1%81%d0%b8%d0%bb%d0%be%d1%86%d0%b8%d0%b1%d1%8b/) which lead to this.

in russia, there is a law which allow roskomnadzor, russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. two years ago i tested how rkn react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. on of that websites was reddit.

one thing i learned is that rkn doesn't want to block popular websites. they respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren't. it was on 05/21/2013(https://img.bi/#/vn0xdfz!sufwaazuq0ogfp6njqpmgqpwensqfa4kln1gdqhz). on 10st aug 2015 they posted a call to help them contact reddit administration(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official vk page. funny thing, but they called psilocybe a plant. several hours ago they reported that reddit is blocked in russia(https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). seems like things changed.

how reddit is blocked? fully. as reddit switched to https, there is no way to block special page.

will i remove this post? no. i also think that reddit administration needs to do nothing. this is important issue on freedom of speech, and only rkn want to violate it.

btw, this post is a guide for indoor growing psilocybe mushrooms in russian. i'm not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to rkn.

"i got a girl deported because we got into an argument.. years ago i was browsing facebook one day and i saw a girl i went to high school with arguing with some other people. i was browsing through the comments and noticed they were all using some really incorrect terms and had some really bad misconceptions about the topic. i wanted to hop in there really quickly and just clarify the terms they were using and show then what terms they should be using so we could have an informed debate. 

she got so mad at me and told me that i was trying to discredit her and make her look stupid. she made a facebook status about me in a long rant and was making some pretty hurtful claims. she then blocked me so that i couldn't respond to the claims. 

i made a fake account and added her as a friend again and found an old status that she made about how her parents illegally brought her over the border as a child. i submitted the photo of her status to a few government agencies and then finished out the school year and forgot about it. she never came back from summer break and some of her close friends mentioned that she had been deported with her family. 

i regret doing that because she couldn't speak spanish because her parents wanted her to live here and truly be an english speaking american and now she is in a country that she doesn't know and she can't speak the language well or at all.",11
"should i (48m) tell my wife (44f) that i received a sex tape of her in the mail?. throwaway.

this is an odd thing. wife and i have been married 20 years. i've never suspected her of cheating and our sex life has been outstanding.

first of the year, i receive a package in the mail. it's a dvd addressed to me, and a typed note that says ""your eyes only"". it's my wife having sex , separately, with three guys. she was younger, much younger, based on body and appearance and hair style it was around the time we were going out—either before, during, or after we were engaged (she grew her hair longer for the wedding and kept it that way).

first i've no idea who sent it to me other than one of those three guys in the dvd - none of which i know. i'm assuming it's one of my wife's ex. second i've know idea why they sent it. are they trying to say she was screwing around on me? the tape isn't time stamped so i don't have a frame of reference. she kept her hair short for years until we were engaged so it could have been during a block of time, certainly before we dated. 

and also what are they trying to achieve if this was taken before we dated? i know my wife had other partners. hell i had three times the partners she did before we married but that was 20 years ago i think we're past that. but apparently this person or persons isn't.

the whole thing is strange. i'm not sure what's going on. i haven't told my wife, i'm not sure how she would take it. she's very sexual and adventurous but i don't think she'd like the idea of her past catching up to her. but i don't think i'll get to the bottom of this unless i tell her.

edit - update. i'm overwhelmed by the responses. thank you for your interest.

i did speak to my wife yesterday afternoon. some mentioned letting her watch it in private and i gave her that option. she did and we talked at length. some of it is a bit clearer now.

the two ""amateur"" looking videos are two roommates, taken on the same night. that's why the camera doesn't move and that's why the room is the same.  i asked why the bed looks different and she replied the sheets were a bit messy so they changed them before they had another go. 

the other is a boyfriend she dated when her and i met, before we actually started dating. she knows this man is friends with one of the before mentioned roommates and thinks it's him who got the three videos together and sent them to us. 

why?

she admits that last summer he tried connecting with her on facebook. when she did he tried to make it sexual again so she stopped. she thinks he sent the dvd to cause an issue with us.

for the first time i now have doubts. her answers are logical but seem a bit off to me. and honestly i may be just upset that she did two guys in one night - i know it was 20 years ago but that's still hard to take call me shallow if you want. also she didn't seem shaken by the dvd or the fact i had it, merely irritated that this person sent it. i had the idea she'd rather i didn't have it but now that i did, oh well. 

it still leaves many questions unanswered, such as why the tapes are from 96-97 and the dvd was made in 2013 but i'm just getting it now? that many be minor but it may be everything. plus how does this gentleman know where i live - facebook doesn't give you that information. being in contact with someone does so now you see why i have doubts.

thanks to you all for your concern and feedback. i love my wife and cherish her, and her past is her past, but for some reason it's slapping us in the face right now. i will take some time between the two of us to figure out what is truly going on. 

edit ii - i want to clarify something. i've been getting a lot of feedback, mostly negative, where everyone is irritated with me that i'm upset with my wife for being with two men in the same night. none of my business, it was 20 years ago i should man up, that sort of thing.

look, i said it was hard to take. most men understand their partner was with different people before them. but seeing their spouse with two men on the same night is hard to handle. i didn't say i was changing my view of her, or leaving, or any other angst you want to put on me. it's just a difficult thing for a married man to see and realize. i'll get past it , but it's not an easy thing. and for everyone who says ""it was 20 years ago lighten up"" i challenge you to sit back, grab a beer and watch two young men have intercourse with your wife on the same night and see how you feel about it. frustrated at best. you won't love her less but you'll not feel great afterwards trust me. so thanks for everyone calling me an asshole but until your in that position i'll ignore you thank you very much .

final edit - this will be my final edit. thank you all for your support but all i will say is, it's time for me to make some decisions. i hacked into my wife's facebook account - childish and immature i'll admit but i did it nonetheless. and i found things disturbing enough that i need to think long and hard about what i do next. i've given her the benefit of the doubt through this entire thing , now a shadow had been cast and i'm questioning her more than ever before. heartbroken is putting it mildly. it's time for me to work on my life and my self. thanks to everyone and their interest .",7

"by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended. obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. my brother and i have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). this agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so i was convinced he still remembered.

a couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. i got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. i decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. there's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. so i went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""brother's name, if you're watching this, i'm already dead. everyone on the world pretty much is. it's been about eight months since you went to hospital name. you need to head for the safe haven in helsinki (we live in western canada) - mom might be there. god speed."" i managed to sync it up to the tv and woke him up as it was starting.

this is where it all goes to complete shit. my brother began to lose it immediately. he started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. i grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. nurses came in and i was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

he got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. my mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. my dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. i'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. i've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

worth the wait though.

tl;dr: convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

edit: wow this blew up?! i don't have a ton of time but:

1) i don't want to upload the video. i made it sound tamer than it was, i look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xd

2) the tvs in the hospital had hdmi ports. i just plugged it into my chromebook. 

3) i can see why people say i made this up for karma, but i didn't create a throwaway to do that.  if i cared that much, i would've posted it on my main account.

4) my mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. she hasn't been happy with me moving (western canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. she paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",4
"for going to the police over a 'prank'. throwaway for anonymity sake incase this does go further.

four nights ago, i was at a party and i will admit, i got white girl wasted. my friends thought it would be funny to feed me chicken nuggets as a prank. i checked with them before chowing down ""are these vegan?"" to which my friends replied ""yeah, they're sunfed"" (a type of vegan chickenless chicken). they tasted off to me but i figured it was just because i was drunk. i was wrong. 

i found out the next day when my sister sent me a message telling me to check my friends snapchat story. the story was them showing the nugget packaging, and then showing them giving them to me (including the conversation where i asked if it was vegan). the and then later them mocking me and pretending to be me when i found out i ate meat (things like fake crying and yelling ""the chickens!!!""). i took a screen recording of the video and took it to the police, on the grounds of food tampering, and now 3 of my (ex) friends are facing charges. 

they all think that i'm overreacting to a 'harmless' prank, so reddit, aita? in my view, they took advantage of my drunken state, tampered with my food, and publically humiliated me. in their view, it was just a prank.",3

"stop freaking out about ""the recession"". hi personal finance!

i see an awful lot of threads here about people wondering how on earth they'll possibly survive this horrible doomsday recession that is just absolutely going to happen any day now.  here's some tips:

1) there is not a gigantic country-destroying recession that is coming to ruin your life in the coming weeks.  talking heads have been predicting one ever since the last recession.  the current news cycle is little more than fear-mongering (full disclosure: i used to be a journalist).  if the current indicators that people are looking at end up holding true, it's still well over a year before things are ""expected"" to go south.  plenty of time to shore up those savings accounts, make sure you're budgeting properly (see below), etc.

2) the last recession was called the great recession for a reason - it was a harder-hitting one than those that came before.  and since it was largely based on a housing crisis, it felt even worse because people were losing their homes due to ridiculous mortgages that they never should have been offered, or agreed to, in the first place.  which leads me to...

3) just be smart.  are you living within your means now?  great!  make sure your emergency fund is in good shape, and continue about your business.  if you're overspending, take a look at your budget and see what you can cut out of it.  this is something you should be doing regardless of how the markets look.  find a cheaper cell phone plan, ditch that $100 / mo cable bill, subscribe to a slower internet package, go out to eat less often, etc.  

4) ""what about my stocks?  should i sell all my stocks?""  no!!!  do.  not.  sell.  your.  stocks.  the only exception here is if you really are completely and utterly broke otherwise and absolutely need the money.  look, i invested almost all of my life savings in late september last year.  and then watched a lot of it go away - on paper.  but guess what?  it's all back already, and then some - because i didn't panic sell.  in fact, **the best thing you can do in a recession is buy more stock!**  a bad market just means that stocks are on sale.  who doesn't love a discount?  again, i wouldn't advise buying unless you have the budget to do so.  

so there you have it, friends.  the world isn't ending.  be smart with your money, use some common sense, and be prepared to make some small sacrifices in the short term *if* a recession hits.

update 1: thanks for the silver!

update 2: i was working my first ""real"" job in 2008, but the pay was so bad that i was not investing much.  then over the next nine year, i didn't invest one single cent out of fear of another big market drop (just left it in savings).  i ran the numbers, and if i had been investing in the s&p 500 at my original rate that whole time, i'd stand to be up about $200,000 at retirement.  **i potentially lost $200k by not investing out of fear of a market turn.**",10
"update ex is saying that she lives with me and that i'm abusive, police kicked me out of my own house. i went to the police station with my ex's(the mother of my child) parents with proof of my ownership of the house, drivers license, my taxes(to show my filing status), and video of her breaking in. they brought her mail that was addressed to their house, not mine. i threw a fit and essentially told them to get her out of my house or else i was going to sue(i have no idea if i actually can or not but it seemed scary enough). i showed them my bruises and scratches from her attacking me and eventually they relented. we went to my house, i let them in, and they went to remove her. they arrested her, cps is now involved, and i'm on my way to a lawyer consultation. thanks for all the help everyone. hopefully this will be my last update.

"cardi b drugging and robbing men makes her a predator. in a recently discovered online video, cardi b claims ""i had to go strip, i had to go, 'oh yeah, you want to fuck me? yeah, yeah, yeah, let's go back to this hotel,' and i drugged niggas up, and i robbed them. that's what i used to do. "" 

that is the work of a predator. maybe it isn't as bad as bill cosby, but as they both drugged people, the two can be compared. cardi b should not be a celebrated public figure.

as a stripper, you are already making way more than minimum wage. if you can't survive off of a stripper's salary, you should go ahead and crawl back into your mother's womb because most people survive off less. 

how many of those men overdosed from the drugs and never made it out of the hotel room? we will never know.

"for asking my brother not to bring his boyfriend to my wedding?. ok this is the worst. i'm losing sleep over this.

i'm getting married in a week to an awesome woman, and i cannot wait to be her husband, we are so excited.

my brother is gay, but my family doesn't know, only me and my parents know. i come from a very old school traditional family, so the old part of the family, grandparents and some aunts/uncles still have last century's mind, and the younger portion, cousins/sibilings are open minded, and are living in the present.

so my brother has been dating his bf for 6 months now, the dude is great, i'm so happy my brother found a great guy. but it's kind of a secret, as he hasn't told my family he is gay.

i've been telling him for years that he should come out, cause i know it stresses him a lot, and i think it will make him feel better not to hide anymore, plus i bet a few family members already know anyway.

but he disagrees cause he knows a part of the family won't accept it and it will be a lot of drama. i see the opposite, i see it as the sooner you know who the idiots are, the sooner we can cut them from our lives. i have no interest in having someone in my life that doesn't accept my brother being gay.

anyway, that's his decision not mine, so for now he won't say anything.

until a few weeks ago, when he said he wants to bring his bf to my wedding. i was not expecting that to be honest. so he went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.

if it was any other occasion i would be supportive obviously, but i don't think my wedding day is the day to do that.  imagine all the drama and gossip and bullshit that would happen. and i don't want to get the attention away from my fiancee, that's her day. and i dont wanna have to worry about that on my wedding day, and i think it's a pretty good reason

i asked him why my wedding day, he said it's because he wants to celebrate love with the 2 people he loves the most, me and his boyfriend. this is killing me. i would fight my whole family for my brother and never speak to them again if i had to, but my wedding day is supposed to be a celebration, not a family fight, and i can't do this to my wife, that might ruin our future. 

i didn't even tell her, she is already stressed out, dont wanna make it even worse

with a heavy heart, i asked him to please come alone to the wedding, and that i hope he understands me. he  started crying and left my house without saying anything.

next day i got a text and he said "" dont worry, going alone"". i tried calling him but he didnt answer  me, and my parents don't seem to know what's happening because they didn't say anything.

he eventually called me back a few days later, we spoke, he said he understands my side, but things are still weird between us

this is the worst situation of my life, am i the asshole for handling it the way i did?

ps 1: i wanna thank the redittor that sent me a private message and said they hope a mass shooter shows up at my wedding, so thoughtful!!!

ps 2: thanks for the gold and stuff!

update: spoke to fiancee, couldn't keep this from her anymore, she agreed with me.

clarification: i know it won't be my brother that would cause trouble. the trouble would start with remarks and looks from some aunt/uncle. doesn't matter, we are spending a lot of money on this wedding, planned it for a long time, my fiancee put her heart and soul into planning this wedding.i don't want to see my bride or mom crying, or some idiot uncle insulting my brother. literally every other day of my life i will support my brother's decision to come out. even at the wedding, i would obviously defend him. but the point is, not at the wedding. also, my brother is not the asshole. not at all.",3
"when stressing over something, use the 10-10-10 rule. will it matter in 10 days? 10 months? 10 years? after getting some perspective, you'll notice how very few things end up worth stressing over.. credit goes to my mom for teaching me this one. ",8
"for choosing my brother over my marriage?. my parents divorced when i was 3, and went into separate marriages. i had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. when i was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. i had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. my mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. my father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. obviously my family is morning, and i've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

the only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and i'm not going to let that happen. i told my wife that i was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. she did not take it well and is furious that i would choose my brother over her. i doubt my marriage will survive, but i can't let my brother go into foster care.

my girlfriend dressed up as a policewoman and told me i was under arrest on suspicion of being good in bed.. after 2 minutes all charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence.,0
"my 33m fiancee 27f chose to save my deceased father's stuff over her deceased mother's in a fire. how can i ever repay her?. two nights ago, my fiancee accidentally set fire to our kitchen and the fire extinguisher in our apartment was defective. the fire spread quickly and burned through most of the building before they were able to contain it. i wasn't home, so i wasn't there to help my girlfriend gather anything up. if i was, i would have forced her outside and told her to leave it all. it's just stuff. 

she chose differently. first, she took out two dogs outside and handed them off to a neighbor on leashes. then she went back in. at this point the kitchen was engulfed in flames and she couldn't make it into the living room, but she could get into the bedroom. she knew she wouldn't be able to make two trips and she had to act fast. 

both of us have lost parents. i lost my dad 3 years ago. he was a friend of her father's so she knew him (though not very well), but he died before i actually met her. i have most of my dad's stuff in a storage unit, but in our bedroom i have his ashes, two guns, and a couple of other very personal things from my time with him. she lost her mom as a teenager, and because her father is an asshole, she only has a few small things of hers, and her wedding dress. 

instead of choosing to save the few things that she has of her mom's, she gathered up my father's things, wrapped them in a sheet, and ran out of the room. 

i don't even know how to begin to say thank you. i'm so completely devastated by her losing her mom's things like that, and i can't imagine what she was thinking or how much she must really love me to make that decision. i don't know how to repay her. or where to begin. can anybody think of a nice gesture i can make it up to her? she must be devastated. i can't imagine losing the last bit of my dad. 

tl;dr: my fiancee had an opportunity to save stuff from her dead mom when the apartment was burning, but chose to save mine instead. how do i repay her?",7
"by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards. this actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. in 2016 i started using tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. i had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. my profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of ""not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices"" and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

fast forward to march of 2017 and i matched with someone. after a couple of one-off messages that don't really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. a couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. this all sounds great. except for two problems.

the first problem is that i have a beard in all of my photos. and even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. my facial hair is like if someone shaved a guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. if i grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. wiry and sparse. it's not good. for six years, i'd still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. but for some reason, the week before we started talking, i had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. i just wanted to know what it looked like. the answer? not. fucking. good. at this point, i was 27 but still looked young for my age. shave the beard off and i look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. really fucking awkward.

so i pulled up to her house and text before i got out of my car to say, ""hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it's just me."" luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as i expected. all good so far.

i went inside and we end up hanging out all night. she cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. she was blown away by the fact that i'd never seen labyrinth and demanded we watch it. we ended up watching three movies that night. for labyrinth, i was about five feet away on the couch. for young frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. for the third movie (which i can't remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. and this is where the second problem comes in. 

after my breakup in 2016 and realizing i'd been battling lifelong depression, i started taking antidepressants. one of the super fun side effects of ssris is that it can be really hard to climax. like, try as you might, nothin. dust. moths. nothin. thanks, big pharma.

and so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like ""holy fuck i might have a heart attack. why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and ""what about this position?"" ""ouch!"" ""oh my god, i need a towel. so. much. sweat. i can't see."" we were in the basement on a large three piece couch. you know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. well at one point i tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. a bruised ass. a bent dick. a lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

if this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven't done any cardio in your fucking life. and jesus christ the sweat. so fucking slippery and gross. this wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. this is bog monsters come to life sweat. this is ace ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. at one point our chests become suction cupped together. i could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn't felt like it was going to explode. and the chafing. fuck. no matter how ready either of y'all are when you start out, after two hours, it's gonna wear off. we both felt like we'd attacked our bits with sandpaper. my poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. this was no climactic movie sex scene. this was a john waters film come to life. 

well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. it's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. we went outside for a smoke and at this point it's about 6am. i'm wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she's only in a bathrobe. we sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (she had just moved back home before finding a new place). so not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now i get to meet her mom for the first time! great! i'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. life is fucking weird.

well, the reason i am posting this on march 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we're engaged to be married on march 14th of 2020. our sex life is far better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. i mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

tl;dr i met up with a tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. now we're engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




edit: just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! i am still wholly undecided if i will ever show her this post. it's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. we'll see though. and thank you so much for the gold and silver! did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. and for those asking, i've changed my dosage on my ssri and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! and also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. he didn't pan out. within three months, her mom got hit up by several tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

edit2: i guess now i probably have to show this to my fiancee to which she will reply, ""i have no idea what any of that means. good for you, i guess?"" i still love her.

edit3: a few of y'all keep asking, ""why in tifu?"" well, let me tell ya, if i had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. even worse than my breakup the year before. not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? yeah, that sucked. just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't suck asssss on the whole. i mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. thanks for coming to my tedtalk

final edit: for real y'all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. i told her about this post when i got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when i read it to her. we spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift drive-thru theater setup",4

"kevin hart should not have stepped down over what he said in 2008. dear americans,

just because one man makes a gay jokes 10 years ago doesn't mean he should have to step down from hosting a huge event. i'm not american and i know and understand your country is one of, if not the most sensitive countries on earth but over 10 years ago? 

what you're doing is making people who tell jokes like this tell them in private, you're not helping in your cause. being offended is a choice and i'm sure you americans can choose to ignore old tweets. back 2008 you could still go on stage in a stand up comedy club and say the word faggot in a joke and people would laugh.

an apology isn't enough anymore. people must now bow down to thy shoe of thy offended because their ego is that fragile.

"update : wife (38f) is convinced that she is pregnant even though that every pregnancy test (store-bought and medical) comes back negative. it's taking a toll on our mariage because she thinks i am going to abandon her and ""our twins"". it has not been that long but i need again advice from you guys about the same topic.

^((original post)(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cyh5cv/wife_38f_is_convinced_that_she_is_pregnant_even/)^()^) 

i called up our primary doctor and told him about the problem . he seemed very concerned and wanted us to come see him the next morning .  he said it was important to be gentle but not feed into her delusions. i sat her down and we talked. all she wanted to talk about is when i would get the nursery started and that we were on a time crunch, and how she has found a perfect color for the room, how she wants me to be more involved in her pregnancy . i tried to be very calm but i was very perturbed by seeing her that way. i asked her to go to the doctor with me tommorow. she said yes, that she wanted to check on the babies either ways. now i took some advice and words you gave me about being calm and asking a bit why she think she is pregnant without calling her delusional . so i did. she kept changing subjects or saying that "" a mother just feels it. you wouldn't know how it is "" then i said that i loved her really much that i would never think of leaving her but we needed to go to the doctor to confirm her ""gut feeling "". she got very agitated and was crying telling me that if i wanted to leave her i should simply leave but i shouldn't call her a liar.

&#x200b;

somehow i managed to calm her down enough for her to go to sleep.

after she did i went on her computer. i do **never** snoop on her. but i remembered a commenter pointing out forums about cryptic pregnancy and so i went for the look out . oh boy. she was in 2 facebook groups. one was a normal mommy facebook group and the other was a group about women that believed they were pregnant. in the ""normal"" group she would post updates about her symptoms and pictures of her ""belly"" and her story about how she was almost not able to have children but thats to the ""grace of god that kissed her tummy"" the ""gift of life was given to her "" and how she was compensated for all this years of suffering with twins. in the other group the women were quite literally, and exuse me here , fucking insane. they were feeding in each others delusions. a woman said that she was almost 2 years pregnant and how sometimes it just takes longer. my wife would post there complaining about doctors that do not take her seriously and about me. so many women were making her fear that i would leave. saying things like men can not stick to a woman . many recounted their stories about how their marriages broke down because their spouses could not ""handle the pregnancy"".

i was really fucking scared. i researched phantom pregnancies and i read somewhere that that could also be a sign of schizophrenia(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3361851/). so to say the least i could not sleep. i was and am still very afraid of losing her. she woke up and i tried to act like nothing was wrong . we were going to the doctor. and it was as if nothing had happened yesterday. she was convinced that we were going to a pregnancy check up. things got really bad when we began talking to the doctor. he was really tactful when talking to my wife. he tried to explain her that it was medically impossible that she was pregnant. we tried to show her tests, the ultrasound we did the day before but nothing. she got more agitated and began to cry and the scream at me for making her look like a crazy person . she began bouncing back and forth and holding her head with both hands . we could not calm her she went in on a full on panic attack . she could not breathe. the doctor laid her down and tried giving her some  medicine for her to relax but it did not help as he didn't have the necessary tools to treat a panic attack that was that bad . she had to go to the hospital where they took care of her. did an ekg to exclude that she was suffering a heart attack.

at that point i really had no other option than to inquire about involuntary commit. so i could not do it myself . i needed my doctors statement that she was a danger to herself and others and he had to initiate the process of an involuntary examination of 72 hours . after that we will have to submit a written statement to the court to determine wether on not she can stay there ""against her will"". so far i have submitted all her posts in both facebook groups aswell as the test we did with timestamps when possible . my wife is 2 days in the 3 days examination and i have no contact to her. when i last her she was furious with me. she said i was taking away her freedom which i am. i fell horrible, dirty and useless. she is so mad at me. i feel like i am abandoning her and don't know how she will ever forgive me this. i love her with all my heart. i am afraid of what will happend if the courts decide that i can't commit her, how our life will be affected . i feel like i failed to protect her. at this point i am just rambeling . sorry for the long post i guess i just need to vent because i have no one else to really turn to that just wants to listen . i feel judged by everyone and pittied ... i just hate it . sorry for spelling mistakes

**edit : i will not fuckin leave my wife you unempathetic dickheads! when i gave my vows i meant trough illness and bad times. i am not only on the ride for the good times. if you truly love somone you will do whatever it takes to see them healthy again. would you leave your spouse if they went trough a severe physical illnes?? i am here to stay. i will not divorce her. she is not a ""fucking psycho"" she is sick. i hope no one of your loved ones ever has to go trough this because their support net will consist of cowardly dickheads.**

sorry for the rant. but if you want to say something line divorce that nut don't even bother. i understand people that make the choice to leave if the situation when it beginns to mess with their mental health  and i respect that but i won't do that.

edit 2: my wife didn't have a heart attack. she was examined because panic attacks register with similar symptoms as heart attacks

i don't exactly know what our doctor gave her as i was so distraught. but i was not a sedative. i think it was something along the lines of valium or baldrian. over the counter stuff mostly.

she has family. she is estranged from most of them. her sister is now at our place to help.

also refrain from such stupid comments like ""i'll bet she will leave bro. she is cray how did you marry her"" because they are not helpful at all. specially the bets that are going on that my wife will leave me once she gets better. just seems like you want me to divorce. get a life.",7

i did as many of you suggested and got a family lawyer who was one of the most kind and helpful people i've ever met in my life. i told her the circumstances of my step mom and dad's death through tears and sobbing, and then told me she'd do everything she possibly could to help me.

after my step sisters bio dad was informed that i would be trying to get full custody, he basically folded within hours. the lawyer told me that it wouldn't have mattered anyway though. she said that because he hadn't visited her for such an extended period of time that it was considered ""abandonment"" in the eyes of the law, and the likelihood of him specifically getting custody was unlikely because of this.

after her bio dad said he didn't want my step sister, i then spent weeks and weeks filing out the right papers and seeing the right people. i've never signed so many things in my entire life. because my step sister had no biological family other than her shit-head dad, i was given custody on a silver platter, according to my lawyer.

her bio dad didn't ask for visitation rights, and it appears he didn't even care in the first place, he just wanted my step sister for no reason other than to further upset me.

yesterday, i signed the last piece of paper that confirmed that i had 100% custody of my step sister. after i signed, we both cried and cried for hours. we're both working on processing the death of her mom and my dad. as i write this, she's asleep next to me with her head on my shoulder.

the past two months have hands down been the worst of my entire life. i consider meeting my step sister the best that's ever happened to me, and adopting her is the single best decision i've ever made. these events have made me realise that family isn't just dna based, it's actionable investments in the life of someone you love.

thank you so, so, so much for all of the people who helped me in my first thread. i owe all of you for the rest of your lives. once i turn 21, if any of ya'll are in the aberdeen area, drinks are on me.

i hope you all lead wonderful lives. give your loved ones a big hug for me.",2
"work punishments include drinking soap and other abuse. my girlfriend works at a retail store in california. they are supposed to ask customers if they want to buy a particular item and there is a punishment board for not doing so. the employee is allowed to choose their punishment from a punishment board.

the punishments are either very hard and often demeaning work or obviously illegal punishments. the hard work is things like cleaning toilets or moving heavy objects. other punishments include doing pushups, coworkers being allowed to hit you with a stick, drinking soap, eating dog food, and sucking on undesirable objects that are not meant for human consumption.

is this illegal? they could argue these obviously illegal punishments are not mandatory, but there is an incentive to do them because the other punishments are so difficult.",2
"still my favorite joke i ever made up. :). a monocle walks into a bar. after a few drinks he starts to feel pretty good (and a little uncoordinated). he reaches for a cigarette, but the bartender stops him. ""sorry, buddy, but due to city ordinances we don't allow smoking in here. you'll have to step outside to smoke.""

so the monocle hops off the bar stool and grabs his cigarettes to head outside. meanwhile a second monocle emerges from the bathroom. they bump into each other as they cross paths and fall to the floor, hopelessly entangled. they try to get free but the more they struggle, the more tangled they become.

the bartender looks down on this travesty and shakes his head. ""hey you two!"" he shouts. ""stop making spectacles of yourselves!""",0
never tell a coworker anything you wouldn't want your manager to hear no matter how much you trust them.. edit: thanks for all the silvers everyone! i got fired a few weeks ago because i told my coworker i was having trouble memorizing the alcohol we had at the store and for taking off for surgery (i'm assuming.) i'm having a hard time so it was nice to see everyone with the same problem. hope y'all learn this lesson through me and not how i did lol.,8
"how my wife and i never fight over money. you get married and then it's living happily ever after, right? well...

a few months after we were married, my wife came home from target with a couple of large shopping bags.

*""what did you buy this time?!""*

no, i didn't say that out loud. i'm not *that* stupid. 

but the thought did run through my mind, and it concerned me.

why was i so upset over a trip to target? i love allison! i trust her, and i know she's responsible. 

she didn't come home with a new car. she didn't gamble away all our savings. so what's the big deal?

then it hit me. 

**i couldn't answer the question, ""are we okay?""**

we were married and happy except when it came to money. every day, my wife used *her* money from *her* bank accounts, and i was using *my* money with *my* credit cards. 

i realized that we were still paying the bills and shopping like we were roommates rather than like a team or a family.

and as i thought more about it, i discovered that how we used money was only *part* of the problem.

at the time, i had just started a career as a financial advisor, and i was being paid with a combination of a fixed salary and commission. the amount i was making was changing every month.

edit: i left the financial advising career about 4 years ago. wasn't for me.

allison had a stable job, but her hourly rate was low. plus, her job was centered around tourism, so the number of hours she worked went up in the summer and dropped in the winter.

at any given moment, we had no idea if we were spending ourselves into a hole or climbing out of it.

we could compare how much we were charging on our credit cards and how much money was in our bank accounts, but that got complicated. 

we had 8 accounts at 5 different banks. answering the question, ""are we okay?"" took a shit-ton longer than it needed to.

allison and i weren't working or planning together when it came to money, and i wanted to make a change.

all i wanted was to answer the question, ""are we okay?"" without getting a degree in accounting.

**we learned how to handle money as separate people.**

before getting married, allison and i really were separate people.

we both had savings accounts, checking accounts, and credit cards to manage. we learned how to pay bills in our own apartments with our own roommates (who were also our groomsmen and bride's maids).

allison and i ended up moving in together for the summer right before we got married, so we were--from a legal standpoint--roommates rather than a family. we got used to paying the bills and shopping as separate people.

looking back, combining our lives and becoming a family needed to happen. we realize now that this moment was inevitable, but no one ever taught us how.

**we were responsible as individuals, but not as a couple.**

i figured that if we didn't start working together with our money, the ""target incident"" would just get worse.

* if i needed a new suit for work, could we actually afford it?
* what happens when we want to go on vacation?
* would allison start to resent me for spending a lot of money on craft beer?
* would i start resenting allison for buying another purse?
* what if we go further and further into debt without knowing it?
* what if we want to buy a house?

i love my wife, and i trust her. but the way we were going, i didn't trust *us*.

**no one ever taught us how to handle money as a team.**

no one ever taught me how to handle money as a spouse. fortunately, i have great parents that i got to watch, and i learned what a great marriage could be. but they never talked about money around me.

in high school and college, i learned how to balance my checkbook, use a credit card, and pay my bills. but it's easy to make decisions when i don't need anyone else's opinion or permission.

allison and i needed to do something different, and it was up to us to change.

**we needed to find some help.**

i was on edge to begin with. trying to network, gain clients, and work long hours already had me stressed out. worrying about my clients' money didn't leave much energy at the end of the day to take care of our money.

any time we needed to go shopping was stressful. hanging out with friends made me feel guilty. we live in florida so of course we like to go to orlando (*""sea world...disney...putt-putt golfing.""*).

i wanted to worry a lot less about money, have some fun, and not ruin our marriage in the process.

it was time to find some help.

**what were the problems we needed to solve?**

allison and i already worked well as a team. we were both responsible, but we had separate financial lives that needed to be combined somehow.

i realized that the three basic problems we needed to solve were:
* how do we see all of our money in one place so we don't miss anything?
* how can we manage day-to-day decisions without nagging each other?
* how do we financially and emotionally support each other in our goals and dreams?

this took some time to figure out.

**step 1: see everything in one place.**

the first thing we did was to get everything into one place. i had been using the app, mint, for years to help track my own stuff. so we decided to start a new account. edit: i took out the link for mint to help out with the thumbnail issue. i'm guessing you can find the app just fine without it.

edit: i am not an employee of mint, nor am i being paid by them. i'm just a fan, and the app has worked well for me. the comments on this post also strongly suggest (but are not limited to) ynab, good budget, personal capital, everydollar, mvelopes, and quicken. you could also use excel, google sheets, apple numbers, or any other spreadsheet software you are comfortable with to budget and keep track of your finances.

* every savings account.
* every checking account.
* all the credit cards.
* student loans.
* car loans.
* every transaction.
* updated automatically.
* all in one spot!

the clouds parted and the angels sang.

we both had access to see everything at any moment on a computer or our phones.

**step 2: give each other permission to spend money.**

the next step was to start budgeting together, and i had to talk allison into this. she had some valid concerns, and it all started with toothpaste.

since i'm a detail-oriented person, i was gung-ho about budgeting and tracking our money. i love it when everything works together perfectly. whereas allison has more of a ""good enough"" personality. she was happy as long as we were staying out of trouble.

so when i started to talk about budgeting, one of allison's first questions was, ""if we spend our budget for toiletries and we need toothpaste, i can't go out and buy more toothpaste?""

it was a good question, and i didn't have the answer right away. over time, we've learned how to budget each month without making the budget set in stone. it's flexible, and when we need to change it...we change it. toothpaste for days!

allison also asked, ""and what if we want to go shopping on our own? do we need to give each other permission?""

the solution here was to budget fun money for each other. every month, allison gets some money that she gets to do whatever she wants with. and every month, i get some money that i get to do whatever i want with. sometimes we overspend our fun money amounts (okay, honestly...it's usually me), but we make it work out.

edit: we also have an ""entertainment"" fund in our budget every month, which is for anything we do together. you could call it ""date night"" money, too.

after making a lot of mistakes, hitting road bumps, finding solutions, and practicing, our monthly budgeting hasn't caused any fights or headaches....for years.

**step 3: decide what we want, together.**

when it came to our goals and dreams, we tried a formal system of tracking what we wanted. but it didn't really work out. it was too much for us as a couple.

our bigger goals like an emergency fund, retirement, and debt took some time, but those goals take *months* or *years* or *decades* to accomplish. once we set the plan, there was no need for a conversation every month.

for the shorter-term ideas, we developed a habit of asking each other, ""what do you want this month?"" 

sometimes i want new running shoes. sometimes allison wants to throw a party at our house for friends. and sometimes we both want a new dining room table.

in the end, we just wait until an idea pops into our mind (*""is it time to go back to disney world?""*), and we decide if we can afford it now or we need to save up. and then put it in the budget.

it's flexible, and it works for us.

**i calmed down...fast!**

after all our financial information was in one spot, i immediately calmed down. 

i had one number that showed me how much combined money we had in ""the bank"" and one number of how much we had charged on the credit cards.

one number minus the other gave me my answer. we were okay.

after we started to budget, seeing a target bag (or any other shopping bag) hasn't bothered me since.

**we never fight about money.**

allison and i have had a lot of fun with friends, visited family, and had wonderful vacations. but we have made a lot of mistakes and have had to deal with a bunch of emergencies.

we talk, discuss, and decide. but we don't fight.

"final update my 29m fiancee 28f of 4 years randomly claimed i abused her, and called the police. this came completely out of the blue.. original post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)  
update post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

so firstly thanks for all of your input. i read and considered every single reply. first i'll update you, then i'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. i want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, i'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and i feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

update: 

i spoke to her in person after i posted my update. from her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. she was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""i don't know, i'll probably tell him that i feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

i said great, all that is understandable. just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

she said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

i thanked her for telling me, and then i called off the wedding entirely. 

she cried, i cried, it was a goddamn mess. she asked where we go from here. i told her i don't know. i don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but i know that the engagement is over, and that **if** i decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. and now i have to decide if **i** want that. do i went to spend another 4 years being undecided? if i'm being honest with myself, i imagine it taking another couple of years before i can trust her again. do i want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? close to 40? 

i told her that i have a lot to think about. 

i spoke to her dad last night. we shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. my ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. she's been crying a lot. i do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

her dad caught wind of the situation on facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. he'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. she told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. he told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. he said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

so that's it. i still have a lot to think about. i know a lot of you guys are telling me that i have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that i still love her and have loved her for a few years now. right now, i'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

as for my reputation, nobody thinks i'm an abuser. it's firmly out there now. her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. i haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. there's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

my family agrees with a lot of you. they're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. just give me some time. i'm not going to make another update post, because i've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe i'll just update this post in a few days after i've decided what to do.",7
"transunion burying their credit freeze to sell their own credit monitoring product trueidentity. i'm not sure where to post this, but noticed something had changed on the transunion website about freezing credit this morning when i was giving links to family so they could freeze theirs. 

i froze my credit the day after news about the equifax breach broke, and it looks like transunion has since changed their site to push people away from freezing their credit in favor for their own product called trueidentity (like what equifax was doing with their trustedid premier.)


the ftc website links to this page(http://www.transunion.com/freeze) for freezing your credit with transunion.


this is what the website looked before the changes were made on 9/11.(https://web.archive.org/web/20170729070041/https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) the instructions on placing a credit freeze were clear and there was no mention of their own trueidentity product.


if you want to place a credit freeze with transunion now:

* you have to get through a page of info about credit and fraud, and then the action it tells you to take is to ""lock your credit information by enrolling in trueidentity.""
* the option to freeze your credit is under ""about credit freeze"", deliberately passive in their use of language
* the description about credit freezing is dissuasive: ""a credit freeze may be available under your state law""
* the link for the credit freeze is also a passive ""click here"" compared with ""by enrolling in trueidentity"" language used for the link to their own product.
* clicking the link to learn more about credit freeze brings you to yet another page(https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze2) that tries to convince you to enroll in their product over placing a credit freeze
* after searching through their page of bs, you finally get to the link to freeze your credit(https://freeze.transunion.com).


this is such a blatant attempt by transunion to take advantage of the equifax breach for their own financial gain. it's a shitty thing for transunion to do, and people should be aware that they are being led away from putting an actual credit freeze on their account.

"being a single dad with half custody is just as hard as being a single mom but i don't have a rally cry of support behind me. my ex has women telling her on social media how amazing she is for raising kids in her own and how strong and independent she is for picking herself up after the divorce (that she caused with her affair) and being a mom. i have none of that. its not that my friends don't think i'm a good dad, its that as a society, we have made the single mom a sort of unsung hero. what about single dads?  we do the same shit. i work and take care of my kids the same way but i don't get celebrated like i'm doing something amazing. i just get the recognition that almost all dads get...nothing. 

edit - thanks for the silver and gold people. i hope this was for agreeing with the premise and not because i sounded like i wanted a cookie for being a dad. it may have sounded like i wanted credit for some shit i'm supposed to do. 

that's not the case. i've been to mom groups to socialize my kids and i'm this weird anomaly and they don't even talk to me so then i play with my kid so i'm not just there on my phone. its not the same for us. we don't have the same resources. although some of you have suggested some that i hadn't heard of. 

anyway, my struggle is the lack of equality, not the lack of attaboy and i think that may be how it came across. thanks for all your support and for making me feel like i'm doing good as a parent. 


edit 2 - well this blew up. i'd like to say that i really appreciate the kind words of me being a good single dad. thanks again for platinum, gold, and silver. to those that disagree or say ""man up,"" that's why i put this in unpopular opinions. not everybody agrees and that's just fine. 

as has been repeatedly pointed out, i know i'm not a full time single parent. i'm still a single parent for a week at a time and sometimes its bad ass and super rewarding cause my kids are the shit. sometimes its hard. just like it is for parents in a couple, part time custody, or full time custody. i can't imagine doing it completely on my own 24/7 and those people get major props.

"successfully negotiated a 45% raise in salary, thanks pf!. i recently decided i wanted to move on from my job for a variety of reasons. one of the main reasons was i felt i was undervalued. so with a lot of research here is how i went from $58,000 to $85,000.

1. i felt i was undervalued, so i needed to prove it. 
2. i needed another job, obviously.
3. i needed to know how to negotiate.
4. i needed to make sure i knew my bottom line and what i really wanted.
5. making the decision.

so lets start with number 1. **am i undervalued?**

i needed to research how much my job title was worth. for this i went to the bureau of labor statistics, salary.com, glassdoor.com, and google.  http://www.bls.gov/ooh/ has nearly ever piece of info you need to decide what your position is worth.  salary.com and glassdoor.com also where close to bls.  don't settle on one source for anything. 

do realize when doing this part that you need to take into consideration the local job market in your area.  where i live for example, i know my area pays less than the median because my cost of living is alot lower than most other places.  so when you decide what the median pay is for what you do, be realistic. for me the median pay was $70,000.  my current job was paying me $58,000.  so number one was finished, i am being undervalued.

on to number 2. **find another job**

i needed to find other places of employment in my area, doing what i wanted to do.  for this i went to the google, as it has all the answers.  i made profiles on careerbuilder, indeed, glassdoor, and monster.  i updated my resume, and started applying for everything i thought i would want to do.  

it is important to realize when applying for jobs it is time consuming and will get frustrating repeating your self over and over.  but you need to stay diligent. also it is worth your time to tweak your resume to match key words in the application you are applying for.  

i wish i would have known the importance of networking as well.  sometimes the best opportunities are ones you get by someone mentioning your name to the right person.  never burn bridges and always reach out to those who may be able to vouch for you.

anyway, i applied for a week straight. then slowly the calls and emails started rolling in. hell yes!

by the end of the week i had 3 interviews setup. i was amazed on just how easy it could be to get the process started.  then the hard part came. interviewing.

my interviews went awesome.  i researched what to say and how to say it, how to accent my strengths, and all that jazz. the best piece of advice on how to interview well is read! google is your best friend.  for me the best things were my drive to succeed and my willingness to learn.  many employers will pick people who are driven over people with alot of experience.  obviously you need to have some skills, but don't underestimate the power of persistence.

employer a gave me a range for the job pretty easily when i asked about it.  this makes your negotiating power much higher as most of you know. but the range was way to low.  i knew already this place was out.  but i thanked them for the interview anyway. sometimes you just are to far apart to waste each others time any further.  be polite though if this happens and move on.

employer b wanted to know how much i wanted for a salary.  i thought ""oh yea i know not to say anything, i am so clever!""  well they didn't budge.  the wouldn't give me a range, and they kept at me.  sometimes this will happen.  handle it accordingly.  i gave them a high range 75k-85k.  they seemed ok with it.

employer c was the same way as employer b. i handled it the same.

number 3. **negotiation**

so i received 3 offers in 2 weeks.  wait, you got offers at all 3 places? hell yes i did! one offer was lower than i wanted, so employer a was out. be sure to thank everyone for there time and offers.  remember... don't burn bridges.

but the other 2 offers where above the median income i researched!  this further made me realize i'm definitely worth more than i'm making now. employer b was at $82,000. employer c was at $75,000.  it was almost surreal for me to hear these numbers.  this validated my thoughts and research of being undervalued even further.

there is a myriad of things to negotiate. don't just think about salary, but the overall package. this article helped me alot when preparing.  http://www.careerempowering.com/interview-power/negotiating-the-best-salary.html  don't be afraid to tell people what you want.  but don't go overboard.  no one is going to pay you 1,000,000 a year to clean toilets.

now that i have these offers i can leverage one against the other.  this works the best when you know a company really wants you. i spoke with both companies back and forth and i knew employer b was the winner. damn this is crazy! 58k to 82k in 2 weeks. 

i go to my current boss and tell him whats happening.  i was upfront and honest about everything, that's usually the best way to go. then my current employer decides to counter offer. $85,000.  what the hell do i do now? my brain is on overload.

through much reading and researching i found that counter offers are generally a bad idea to accept.  i mean i wanted to leave anyway, that hasn't changed.  so i took the counter offer and spoke with the other employer b about it.  they decide to match the salary and i negotiate more days off.  is this really happening? 85k

number 4. **knowing what you really want, and what you bottom line is**

the offer of $85,000 was above and beyond my bottom line.  the overall package of benefits matched my expectations.  the job is what i wanted to do.  you need to know this stuff going in and be able to walk away when someone does meet your bottom line. staying strong and not budging on this bottom line is essential.  

finally 5. **making the decision**

the hardest part of all this stuff is making an actual decision. i'm going from $58,000 to $85,000 in either decision i make. i'm on the winning side either way.  try and take your emotions out of it, and look at the facts.  for me i decided to take the new opportunity and take the plunge into the unknown.  do not second guess yourself. 

i realize my situation may not be average.  getting a 45% raise probably isn't typical. but the fact remains that it is possible to negotiate a better lifestyle. it is nerve racking, intense, anxiety inducing, and difficult.  but it is all worth it in the end. i hope this helps at least one person in their pursuit of a better life.  thanks pf for all the help and courage to tackle the unknown.",10

my driveway is no longer a road and i am no longer being assessed for repairs and i am legally allowed to do what is necessary to stop traffic from crossing my property so both sides of the property have been ditched and bermed and a steel pole gate across the side i plan on keeping open. sheriffs dept has been out multiple times dealing with people trying to enter the property but they are starting to get the hint that road is closed.

we are currently in negotiations for a portion of my property to be purchased and turned into a road but not 10 feet from my house, there is a county commissioners meeting next tuesday and it is on the docket to be brought up.

&#x200b;

my driveway is no longer on google maps as a road, signage posted private property no trespassing, dead end road, etc etc etc. several people are angry about it as they are used to the pass-through but with the cameras i have installed i've been able to get clear images of vehicles and license plates of the worst offenders and they will be cited according to the sheriffs dept.

&#x200b;

i have contacted amazon and ups about their trucks crossing my property, ups has instructed their drivers to no longer use that route, haven't heard a thing back from amazon yet but i have stopped two of their trucks so far,both of which were ticketed by the sheriffs dept and the one needing a tow to get pulled off the berm it got stuck on.

&#x200b;

thank you all of you for the suggestions, hopefully soon this will all be over and i can get on with my life.",2

"by making my wife think i killed myself. right off the bat i want to say that i am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. this was not a prank gone wrong, or something i did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. burner for reasons.

&#x200b;

this happened a couple of weeks ago. i tripped and sprained my ankle. it's been bothering me enough that i've been taking epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. in addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, i also find it incredibly relaxing. say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, i enjoy a good soak.

&#x200b;

i also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. it's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...i call them old man spots. they're harmless, and most of the time i don't even notice, but every once in a while...i'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. additionally it takes foreverrr to get the bleeding to stop...its not like i can elevate my balls, let alone put a band aid on...

&#x200b;

well...on the day in question, i get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. so, i get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. it's not really important how i did it, but i ended up nicking one of those spots. so, after cursing a reasonable amount, i start the lengthy ritual of holding tp against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. even after the bleeding stops i have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...well i finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. i put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&#x200b;

 i wasn't asleep but i was really zoned out and relaxed...until i was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. i've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. it scared the shit out of me, and i jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. i shouted ""honey? what the fuck!""  she didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  it took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""jesus christ!"".....i could see what it must look like to her... i had apparently not stopped the bleeding as well as i thought i had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&#x200b;

it took me a long time to calm her down, and i don't think that's something you just get over. hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though i thought i had. took a bath, zoned out. wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact i was bleeding into the water and thought that i had killed myself. sorry honey.

"ex-wife is suing me for child support. i don't even have a penis... (update). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/585svt/exwife_is_suing_me_for_child_support_i_dont_even/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i have both good news and bad news.

the good news is that i won the battle with my ex. i put all my money together and got a lawyer and we fought back against her child support claim against me. i had documents about me showing i don't even have the body parts to even be able to father a child (i don't have penis or testicles) and that the date of the documents were long before i married her. however paternity tests were ordered anyway which came back negative. that ended the case. it took a while and it caused me a lot of stress but i won. i don't know what my ex was thinking going after me like that. maybe she thought that i won't fight back since my health was very poor at the time.

the bad news is that, i'm dying. as i mentioned in the comments of my original post, i was battling cancer at the time that i made the post. it was the fourth time in my life that i was dealing with cancer and even though i had some success in fighting it last year, it's now back and i have very little chance of beating it again. i will make it to 2018 but that year seems to be the end of my journey. i'm happy with the life i've lived and will continue to live a happy and free life until i finally rest for good. 

thank you all for helping me and giving me hope to fight back. it helped me stay focused and having something to fight for definitely helped me stay more hopeful. you could see from my comments on the original post that i was almost ready to give up. ",2
"update: my sister (f22) ripped up my(f19) stan lee autograph and i haven't forgiven her even tough our mother (f46) is pressuring me to. thanks for the great advice. so a lot has happened after mom and sister left and we took the money that was menat for my sister's car down payment for the restoration.

my grandma called me and asked what was happening. 

i explained to my grandma what happened and tried explaining who stan lee was. surprisingly she understood just perfectly. i was relieved. for a moment i thought that my dad and i would get shit from everyone.
my sister started giving me shit about telling our grandma and being a ""snitch"". i told her that she asked me and i just told the truth.

but what took the cake was that my sister apparently ranted in her friend group chat about me and how she couldn't understand my behavior. she again ridiculed my hobby and so on. one of the dudes was really pissed and they had a big argument in the gc. the dude was so mad that he posted the screenshots in his insta story and they spread like wildfire. she is now being ostracized by our community with a few exceptions.

my mom and sister came back in the morning. they didn't talk much to us . my mom  came in my room and asked if we found somone that restored the picture. we had a short dry conversation till she asked me why i was making such a big deal about it. and i shut her up like you guys told me to. i started by explain who stan lee was, how long the painting took me, how much it meant to me, equated it to the monetary value and ended it with ""it is not only about the autograph. it's about the disrespect you both showed me and how little you seemed to care about me. you said that it was not worth it to destroy family over materialistic things but your daughter destroyed my most valuable possention because i didn't lend her my jacket ""

ya'll my mom cried. she apologized profusely. she said she just didn't know how to deal with it and just wanted the tension to be over and as i was more cool headed than my sister she selfishly expected me to be the bigger person.

my mom and dad are now talking to my sister very seriously because she has yet to apologize for everything.",7

"i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. update here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d68r0f/update_im_out_600_after_my29m_best_friend31m_and/)

&#x200b;

groom and i had been friends since middle school and best friends since high school. i'm one of the only people he talks to about his emotions, which is particularly important because i've been his go-to for advice, especially in relationships. in fact, since knowing him, i've talked him through each of his break ups. we've mutually called each other brothers, he helped me move, i helped him plan and throw his mom's birthday party. i'm close with his family, his mom actively asks about me. i've also been close to each of his significant others, save for his now wife.

a month after his engagement, groomsman invitational boxes went out. we have a very tight knit group of friends that have been together since high school, supplemented by college and work friends. of the original high school group, i was the only one not asked to be a groomsman. this obviously stung, but i maintained a jovial demeanor towards everyone while acid flowed in my veins. it triggered my depression for a solid month where i questioned so much (do any of my friends even care about me? am i not groomsman material? is it because they thought i was too fat?) until the groom and i had a talk.

he said it was a very hard decision choosing groomsmen, which i'm sure it was. he told me that i was in the original roster of groomsmen (only 6 out of 7 had received invitations) but that the bride would not sign off on my involvement. apparently, i had said something off-color about their relationship as it was beginning and she held it against me ever since. she'd apparently never brought it up until now, years later, and never gave me any indication of being uncomfortable with me (her family even loves me). i'm generally a very positive, well-received person, so this was news to me. he said it was tearing him up inside, and i believed him at the time, and he asked me to try and talk to her, see if we could make amends. he said that he'd let her know that i knew about how she felt towards me and that i'd be reaching out to talk about it. so i messaged the bride through text and dm, saying (paraphrased), ""hey! i'm so sorry if anything i've said has upset you. can we meet sometime and talk? i'd love to clear it up, or hear your side at least."" the bride leaves me on read, and a month later, the final groomsmen invitation box goes out to another friend.

fast forward to a few weeks ago, the bride, groom, and i are hanging out. groom and i are talking, and i'd since been able to process the reality of not being involved in my best friends wedding, so i ask how he's doing, and how all the prep is going. the conversation leads us here...

groom: hey man, i wanted to know if you could help me out with something?

me: sure. what's up?

groom: i was wondering if you would want to usher for me? it's no big deal if you can't, but i want you to be there for me if you can, you know? like, be a part of the wedding.""

me (very touched): yeah! of course i can, dude. anything for you two.

groom: thank you so much. you know, we also have the rehearsal dinner next week. i know it's late notice, but if you can make it...

me: i'll have to see if i can leave work early, but i'm already there, man. thanks for thinking of me!

a week goes by with no updates or details on ushering or the rehearsal dinner, so i shoot him a text saying, ""hey man! big day's this weekend. just wanted to reach out and see if you still needed help with ushering, or if you'd still like me at the dinner. i got the time off with my boss, so i can definitely make it. just let me know."" he returns my text a few hours later with a call saying (paraphrased), ""yeah man, we would still like you to usher. i'll text you details later today, but we actually don't need any help at the rehearsal dinner, we kind of want it to just be the bridal party and stuff, but yeah. thanks for helping us out!"" i'm a little put out, but i persevere. at least he asked me to be an usher. that's something, right?

morning of the wedding comes around and i'd still not received any details on what ushering is going to be like, or what time i should show up to the reception to start helping. then bride messages me asking for a favor. these messages were juxtaposed perfectly against the unanswered messages i had previously sent the bride to olive-branch our relationship. bride says they forgot about the appetizers & need someone to pick them up. can i do this for a bride, on her wedding day? sure. oh, one more thing, the order hasn't been paid, but they'll give me money at the ceremony, or pay me back at the reception. **sure.**

at this point i should have stopped and asked myself, ""why am i helping so much? why didn't i ask for their money up front? should being a good friend really cost you so much emotionally, physically, or monetarily?"" hindsight. 20/20. with the ceremony ended, my group of friends who weren't in the wedding party spend the hour and a half before the reception pre-gaming while i go pick up the appetizers. thank god i played as much tetris as i have, because fitting all that in my car in such a way that they wouldn't otherwise topple and ruin the wedding was an all-time high score achievement. i text the bride to let her know we've got everything together and i'd see them at the reception. once again, left on read.

i get to the reception venue expecting a bustling crew of event organizers and family to receive me and help bring the food in. i find no leadership at the venue, no planners, no family who weren't already seated at their tables and otherwise willing to help the newlyweds get things ready. the venue does have staff, but they are all preoccupied with in-venue needs. so i have to carry all the appetizers inside by myself.

since guests were already seating themselves, i immediately moved from placing the last appetizer box in the back to working usher duties at the front. it was a fucking mess. at one point, i was so down about the situation that i literally googled, ""is it an insult if someone asks you to usher their wedding?"" to start, the place cards were in no discernible order. they were also written in intricate cursive that was sometimes unclear. i should mention, too, that because of the cultural heritages of our newlyweds, we had some very interesting, hard to spell, and sure as shit hard-to-read-in-cursive names. we weren't given a table map, or a master list, or any direction at all. the best part is, i say ""we"" because at this point i met my ushering-peers; they were the grooms youngest adult cousins, aged 18 and 19 (i'm 29), and they were really good at finding names and seating people. when i asked why they were so good, they said, ""they always make us do this because no one else wants to. we did this at the wedding last year.""

after finding out that, to the groom, i was about as equal as the lowest-rung of his family, my group of not-in-the-wedding-party friends shows up. they ask me to stay for a drink, but i can't because i'm still ushering. as i step back behind the name card table, i take a look out the door to my left and see the groomsmen laughing and taking a selfie. to my right, i see all of my other friends at a table without me, taking a shot. i look down at the random, nonsensically ordered name cards and i wonder, how did i get here?

wedding kicks off & in the rare instance i can speak to bride & groom they don't say thank you or bring up the money. i also don't talk money because it's their fucking wedding reception, but what should i do, pluck $500 from her wedding dress during the money dance?  i'm sure it's true of other weddings, but it seems like the bride and groom don't really engage or reply when i walk up to them with my hugs and congratulations. i can understand this. maybe they're burned out. maybe they're trying to hold back things from boiling to the surface.

now the last song is playing, and the lights are on, and everyone's getting ready to go home and the groom approaches me.

groom: hey, thanks again for your help. i was wondering if i could borrow you again?

me: what's up?

groom: did you drive here? we have stuff we need to get back to the hotel... it could really help us out.

me: ... how far is the hotel?

groom: 10 minutes away.

me (for a groom, my best friend, on his wedding day: .... sure.

get to hotel, unpack everything, it's 12:30am, i'm hungry. groom says to stick around, we'll hang out, drink more. he goes to get changed, i say i'm gonna grab food & come back. groom asks for food for he & bride. i say sure. bride's cousin overhears & asks me to buy her food too. sure. then she asks the room at large who'd like food. now i'm buying food for almost the whole after party. cousin says she'll venmo me when i get back, & she'll pay for everyone elses stuff. **sure.**

come back, cousin is passed out. drunken guests grab whatever food they see. groom walks up to me, burger in hand, & says he's actually really tired so he's gonna go pass out, but thanks for the food and help, and then leaves. i grab my food, take the elevator to the first floor hotel cafeteria, & eat alone, upset, in silence. at this point, i'm out $500 for the appetizers, $80 for the late night food run, and am pretty sure that i never really had a best friend to begin with. i feel used, humiliated, upset, and incredulous. i went from, ""being a groomsmen,"" to being a guest, to being an usher, to being an unpaid wedding coordinator. this was the first wedding in my close knit friends circle and it turned out nothing like how i thought it would. i've never worked so hard for such little gratitude and i'm left wondering how i could have been such a chump, and how many other times i'd been taken advantage of for being helpful.

the advice i'm hoping for is, how can i go about expressing how terrible a time i had at his wedding without insulting him, if i should do that at all, how can i develop myself to not be put in situations like this, and when would it be appropriate to ask for the appetizer money back? also, i feel like the missing puzzle piece is the bride's side of the story, but she still hasn't given me any indication of what i did to her. i know she read my texts about wanting to clear the air, she had to have when she asked me to get the appetizers. how can i start a dialogue with her and sort this out if she won't even acknowledge it? should i just step away from this relationship all together (after getting back my money)?

&#x200b;

tl;dr ""best friend"" couldn't make me groomsmen cause of now-wife, who had no problem asking huge favors of me on the day of the wedding, little to no thanks, out $$$, ended up doing the most out of whole friend group (groomsmen / bridesmaids included), ended the night feeling defeated and losing even more money.

&#x200b;

update: wow. thank you for your overwhelming response to this. i want to thank everyone who took the time to share with me, be it positive or negative. i really feel like i need to hear it all before i make a next move, and i'm especially grateful for those of you who have extended friendship to me and those of you have been very critical of me. i'll take it all. i just want to become better than i am now. i'm legitimately reading through everything and, after work, i'll post a fleshed out update.",7

i have seen a lot of posts recently about best practices with car buying, but i haven't seen anything on _how to_ lease a car. so i figured i'd write this up! 

ok, let's get this out of the way right away: leasing isn't for everyone. in fact, it's probably a bad idea for most people. but if you are going to lease, you need to know how leases work and where they get the numbers in order to get the best deal. and knowing the numbers may actually make you realize it's a terrible deal and to stay away. 

but for this post, i'm not debating the merits of leasing, just explaining how the math works, what your costs actually are and how to realistically minimize those costs. 

this post will include the following info:

- the math behind the calculation
- what kind of car to look for
- where to find the info you need
- how to negotiate the best lease

***the math***    

let's start with how the lease monthly payment is calculated. 

the formula is: payment = depreciation + finance charge.    
your depreciation is: ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months)   
your finance charge is: ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor   
so your total formula is: payment = ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months) + ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor)

pretty simple right? so what do those things mean?

capitalized cost: this is the amount financed. did you know in a lease, you are actually financing the depreciation? this can be higher or lower than the price of the car, depending on whether or not you are putting money down, rolling over negative equity, or tacking on fees into your payment. the lower the better!

residual value: this is what the manufacturer (or the bank, if using a separate lease provider) thinks the car will be worth at the end. it's expressed as a percentage. 50% or 0.50 means they think it will be worth half as much in the end. the more miles you want, the lower the residual will be. residual can also vary by trim package (i.e., the ""limited"" has a higher residual than the ""sport""). the higher the better!

money factor: this is the interest rate. for some reason, it's always actual interest rate / 2400. so 4% = 0.0016 and 0.9% = 0.000375. the lower (more zeroes) the better!

number of months: how long you want to lease for. sometimes manufacturers juice the leases depending on months. for example, vw wanted to move jetta glis off their lots a few years ago, and had insanely inflated residuals and ridiculously low money factors on 2 year leases, making them about $100/mo less than a 3 year lease.

refundable security deposits: this is expert level leasing. almost no one knows about it, even dealerships. but some banks allow you to put down a refundable security deposit in order to lower your money factor. this is usually for people with low credit to secure the rates of someone with higher credit, but some let people with top tier credit put down money to get an even lower rate. i was told by the finance manager and the sales manager at one toyota dealership that i was wrong. i asked them to call toyota, and they came back and said ""well, you learn something new everyday"". if you are doing a refundable security deposit, simply calculate if the reduced payment on your lease will be higher than the guaranteed return on your money. in other words, if you put down $3000 and get $20/mo off, at the end of 3 years you'll have $3000+20x36 = $3,720. that's a 7.44% guaranteed return!

***type of car to look for***   

to get the cheapest lease possible, you want to find a car that the manufacturer is discounting (this will reduce your 'cap cost'), which has a naturally high resale value (think honda or toyota), and a low money factor (triple zero!). 

you can monitor for specials, search online for deals, or call around when you are looking for a car. if manufacturers are advertising cheap lease deals, it probably means they are either discounting the car or offering a really cheap money factor. just realize that if it's being advertised, you can do better by negotiating. 

as with anything, google is your friend as well: i got my parents a great lease deal by googling ""current lease deals"" and finding out that mazda was basically doing interest free leases - they're driving a $30k car for $315 a month, with zero money out of pocket.

***where to get the info***   

so now you know you want to lease a car. you need to start filling in the blanks. what are the sources of this information:

- dealerships. they won't tell you easily, but if you make it clear you are a serious buyer, they'll share the real info with you. i've found that sales managers and internet departments are the most likely ones to share the info.
- edmunds tmv. this a great source to find out how much cars are actually selling for in your area. you can option the car and price it out and see if it's realistic to get a car below invoice or at msrp or somewhere in between.
- cargurus. i've found this site/app super helpful for knowing what specific cars are available in an area, what the average price is, and how long the car has sat for.
- edmunds vehicle specific forums. this is the best source i've found for up to date residuals and money factors. the mods of the forums answer specific questions on current vehicle offers.
- google. if you google ""money factor + residual + make/model"" you might find another source that will break it down for you. 

i like to find all of the numbers, plug them in, figure out what the monthly payment would be, and then start calling dealerships to confirm my numbers are right. this makes negotiation easy - figure out what you want to pay, figure out a reasonable price, and then find someone who will sell it to you for that. speaking of...

***the negotiation***   

here's where it can get tricky. even if you know the numbers and know what you're trying to do, they'll still try and add stuff on. there are curveballs everywhere. 

also, it's going to be rare that you'll find a sales person who will dive into calculating at this level. they will ask you about monthly payment, your trade-in, what you want to pay. you need to be firm and stick to your plan. the last time i leased this led to me walking out of one dealership after they wouldn't play ball. their loss, i walked into one the next weekend and leased the same car for less than i was willing to pay at the first one. 

the key strategy is this: _focus on the sale price of the car_. you already know the money factor and residual. those are driven by the bank and the dealer can't budge (unless they find you another bank). you want to negotiate the lowest sale price possible. this is where the edmunds tmv and cargurus info is so helpful.

do not talk about down payments. do not talk about monthly payments. do not talk about trade-ins. do not talk about _anything_ except the sale price of the car.

why is this so important? because the residual is always calculated based on the msrp of the car. but the closer the residual is to the sales price, the less depreciation you are financing. so the lower ""sale price"" you can base the lease on, the cheaper your payment!

some other tips to think about when negotiating: 

- never put money down. all a downpayment does is reduce your cap cost. but if you drive off the lot that day and get slammed by an 18 wheeler and have the car totaled, you'll never see that money again. never put money down.
- if you can, sell your car privately. don't trade it in on a lease. why? see above. it's money, and it may disappear. there are obviously exceptions to everything, but in general, don't trade a car in.
- watch for additional fees. dealers charge for document fees ($100-$500, may or may not be negotiable) and a host of other factors. ask for these to be separated out, then decide if you want to lease them. when your money factor is near 0, you may be ok with ""financing"" these costs. but you may just also want to pay them up front (note: this isn't a down payment).
- taxes: these vary by state, but in my state they're based on a prorated lease rate. so it's a monthly payment of (6.5% x calculated monthly payment) is added on to your total payment.

so what are some real world examples:

i currently lease a 2017 toyota 4runner off road premium. the msrp of my car is $40,500. toyota was running a lease special of $399/mo with $2,999 down, plus taxes and fees for a base sr5 that goes for about $37k. seems like a great deal, right? and i should be paying more for a more expensive vehicle than their current special, right?

well, i looked up on edmunds and found out that the car was actually selling for closer to $38k. cargurus confirmed this, and also showed that several were available near me and had been sitting on lots for a couple weeks. i did some research and found out the residual was high for a 3 year, 36k mile lease (i think 65%) but the money factor was kind of meh (0.00225). let's see the differences, using the msrp:

payment = ((capitalized cost - residual value) / number of months) + ((capitalized cost + residual value) * money factor)

((40,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = ($40,500-$26,325)/36 = $393.75 +     
((40,500+ (40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $150 = $544/mo .   

ok, now let's play around with this a little bit. let's remove $3000 from the ""capitalized cost"" after we learn that the average edmunds selling price is $2500 below msrp (and we're going to negotiate a little better than average).   

((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .65)) x .00225) = $143 = $454/mo

we just dropped almost $90 off the price by knowing what we can actually get the car priced out. how do we lower the price a little more? turns out, toyota will drop the mf from 0.00225 to 0.00153 if you put down $3600 in fully refundable security deposits, returned in full at the end of lease completion. let's run the math again.

((37,500 - (40,500 x .65))/36 = $310 + ((37,500+(40,500*.65)) x .00153) = $98 = $408/mo

another $50 off. we dropped our interest rate from 5.4 to 3.67 and the price came down accordingly. 

now, let's plug the same numbers in and push for a dream price: $36,500. that gets my payment down to $379. with a tax of 6.25%, my final payment will be ($379*.0625)+$379 = $402. since my goal is $400, it's now to time to call some dealerships and see if they'll play ball.

i took out my cargurus app, found what was on their lots, did the exact math based on exactly how they were optioned (typed the same exact cars into edmunds), and then made specific offers and was transparent about the info i knew:

""hello dealer, i see you have a 2017 4runner on your lot with xyz options. i believe the residual is 65%. my research tells me the money factor is 0.00153 with a $3600 refundable security deposit. if you'd be willing to base a lease off of a cap cost of $36,500 with no money down, then i will come in today to sign paperwork"".

notice a few things: i share numbers that show i'm serious and have done research. i make an offer and tell them i'm ready to close the deal. i don't mention monthly payment. i confirm the numbers. 

the results of this effort: two dealers were interested. one dealership told me to come in, then wouldn't move off msrp. when i complained to head of biz dev at the dealer, he told me i obviously worked for toyota - ""why don't you just use your own discount to order it from the factory?"". he was serious too, and said that no one who wasn't in the car industry would have the knowledge or info i had. i sent him links to cargurus and edmunds and never went back. the other dealer told me to come in.

now here's where it got interesting. the sales manager asked if i'd be open to working with another bank besides toyota. he brought out a sheet from a local credit union and shared their numbers (this is something i've seen that happens when you make it clear you know what you're talking about and are serious about buying: they stop bs'ing you). 

the money factor on this bank's lease was .00165 (3.96%). higher than toyota's lowest, but no security deposit. and the residual was 0.68, also higher than toyota's.

((37,500 - (40,500 x .68))/36 = $276 + ((37,500+(40,500 x .68)) x .00153) = $107 = $384/mo

another $25! now this is getting good. now's when we started the real negotiation. i pushed for $36,500 and said i'd sign on the spot. we ended up settling on $36,900 after some back and forth. 

final price: $366 for the car, $23 for the tax, $389/mo total, $1500 out of pocket, $40,500 car.
what was toyota's advertised deal at the time? $399/mo, $3000 down (includes fees), for a ~$37,000 car.

so by knowing how the lease works, i got significantly more car for less money per month, no money down, and the same out of pocket costs!

now, we still had to finalize a couple other things:

- gap insurance: you need this on a lease. the bank i was leasing included it, but apparently toyota does not. so another $10/mo or so in savings.
- acquisition fee: unfortunately, the bank makes you pay an initial fee to take possession of the car. in my instance, it was about $800, which was about $150 more than the toyota lease. i could have added this to the cap cost and paid about $20/mo more, but i decided to pay this up front.
- first month's payment: varies by manufacturer, but i chose to pay this up front as well.
- plates, title, registration, etc: varies by state. i paid them up front as well
- document fees: dealerships often inflate these to make money, since they often don't make money on the car itself. you can push and negotiate on these, but sometimes they'll waive them and sometimes not. and if they do waive them, you'll probably pay for it in the sale price of the car. i'm ok with a business making some money, as long as i know exactly what it is. i paid this up front as well.

if i had rolled all of those fees into the lease, i would have basically been financing $1500 at 4%. now there's the argument that if i rolled it in and got into an accident, the gap insurance would basically pay for it. overall, it would have added about $50/mo to the cost of the lease, so i paid it all up front.

so in the end, i took possession of the car for $1500, didn't have a payment for 30 more days, and now owe $389/mo for the next 3 years on a $40k+ truck. if i want to buy it in the end, it's simply the residual cost ($27,540). if i choose to buy it out before then, it's simply a matter of getting a loan or writing a check for the current buyout price that month.

so to summarize, if you are going to lease:

- know how a lease works
- use your internet resources to find out the current manufacturer rates for your car, but be open to different banks
- learn the points to negotiate the lease on
- don't negotiate monthly payment
- reach out to multiple dealerships, but be straightforward, respectful, and up front.
- don't put ""money down"", but realize it may make more sense to pay some things up front.



***bunch of edits/follow-ups:*** 

- well, i didn't expect the front page and 2 golds (thank you!). i was just trying to do a knowledge dump that i could share if people had questions on their lease. i always assumed my pitbulls or cat would be the thing that got me to the front page.
- the audience was /pf, which is generally against leasing. i wasn't interested in that debate, and there are plenty of sources out there to decide if a lease is for you or not, or when it makes sense and when it doesn't. leasing isn't necessarily the cheapest way to drive (although it can be), but sometimes there's more to life than spending the least amount of money as possible to make it through your day. but there's no reason to overpay for something that you are getting, especially if understanding how it works can save you money. 
- if you are going to lease, please do more research than this post! i was just sharing what i've learned. i wanted to share the numbers from mine to show how the payment can go up and down, and then shared where i found the numbers and how i approached the process. not trying to claim it is the *best* way, just that if you are going to lease you should understand the mechanics of it.
- i got a few pms and messages that i said not to put money down and then i did. this is a valid criticism. the first payment is due at some point and i'd rather use my rewards card than ach for that, so the only out of pocket money i paid was the acquisition cost, doc fees, and title/reg, which was about $1100 total. in hindsight, i should have just rolled that all in and had a higher monthly payment. at the time my reasoning was that it's not cap cost reduction and i didn't want to ""finance"" the acquisition cost. in hindsight, the same logic applies - if the car got totaled, i'd be out that money. so do as i say, not as i do!
- thank you to everyone who provided feedback on typos and errors. i believe i fixed all of the math format edits and mixups on switching cap cost and msrp. if you see any other errors, feel free to pm me and i'll fix them.
- several people mentioned leasehackr.com. it's an awesome site and has a great calculator. if you aren't comfortable with building your own spreadsheet, just use theirs! they also have great breakdowns on things like the deal of the month if you are just looking at getting cheap leases.
- as someone said in the comments, please be respectful to folks if you're buying a car. i personally think having #s and doing research makes it easy for everyone because it removes the ""is this guy bs'ing me?"" part. even the dealership that i walked out of in frustration, i thanked the sales guy for his time and told him to call me if his sales manager was willing to budge on price. but the dealer i did buy from, the sales manager said ""you'd be surprised how many people think i'm trying to screw them when i offer leasing through our 3rd party bank"".

and finally, i'll say it again: if you are going to lease, please research beyond this post. don't make 3 year commitments for thousands of dollars based on one guy's post! hopefully my post helps you understand a little more how it works and provides a starting  point for research, but it wasn't meant as a be all and end all comprehensive guide!",10

"by not telling my wife our son was coming home. this happened sunday night.



my oldest son is in the marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  he took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  at first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. when it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  i tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  



i get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  he gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his dress blues.  now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.



we discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  we go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  we settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... free internet points and all that......



i walk in and the house is quiet.  no one in the living room.  a little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......



what i did not know was the entire time i was gone, my wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  she got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



so no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to surprise her.  a handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  the text told my son to stay outside.  i had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



so my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  i told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  the look of confusion on her face was priceless.  it took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, there was our son in his dress uniform and she was estatic.  the noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  it goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess will have to suffice instead.




tl;dr  didn't tell wife that marine son was coming home, missed out on sexy times and the second half of the packers/falcons game

"i stole a microwave from walmart out of desperation. i while back while i was still in college i lived with my then fiancee in a very over-priced apartment in a relatively big city. at the time, my job was only paying about $7.50/hr and i was studying and working full-time just to pay the bills. basically a decent yet expensive apartment, and *just* enough money to pay the bills.. not much wiggle room.  


well one night my s/o was at work and i was at home, heating up some leftovers for dinner in our microwave and as i go to take the plate out, it slips and hits the door of the microwave on the inner edge and completely **shatters** the front of the microwave. so i'm freaking, expecting my s/o to come home mad at me and/or just stressing about having to buy another one. and then i saw a walmart receipt on the counter and i went to walmart.  


it was probably around 9pm, my s/o was going to be getting off soon, so i'm rushing. i walk in, find the *exact same* model of microwave that we have, and grab it off the shelf. i took the receipt out of my pocket and held it with the microwave, and just walked out the door. after getting it out and setting it up i told my s/o i cleaned the microwave. never told a soul about it. that was probably about 6 years ago... still using the microwave :/

edit: holy shit i didn't think this would get so much attention. i'm going to reply to some comments later today but i'm about to work a 10 hour shift so it'll be a while.

also yes my relationship dynamic at the time was toxic. i found that out about 6 months later. in a much better place now. thanks :)",11

"by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway.. yesterday i got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. i squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. i notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where i'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. he looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. as a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

though i couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so i decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. as i sat down i thanked him for making room and told him i really appreciated the gesture. we high-fived and in hindsight i should have ended it there.

i noticed he had his backpack with him so i asked how school was that day. he told me it was just alright. then i asked the fatal question, ""do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" he let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. she yelled ""oooo boy!! you told me you finished that yesterday! guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! you, ya little liar!!!"" his head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

a few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. he looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, i thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" his look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 

hang in there little buddy! one weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies!

"my (36m) wife (33f) was sued, i'm feeling resentment towards her and i don't know how to move past it.. fwiw this is not a post asking for any legal or financial advice, we already have a lawyer and have help financially. no offense to reddit, but i'd rather not get any legal advice from a forum, but i'm okay getting relationship advice it seems. 

as the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. the money is a significant amount for us, we didn't have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

my currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger i'm feeling towards my wife. until now i've always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. but, since i'm the breadwinner i can't help but to feel like i'm spending ""my"" money on something that isn't my fault. i've had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. however, i have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of god… not a stupid lawsuit where i know my wife is guilty. she has a part time job and doesn't make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

what did my wife do? (note: i had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

she used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of 'recruiter'. my wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but laura gave her a personal email address instead. my wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as laura at her company. these messages said derogatory things about laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make laura look bad. her manager got one of these messages that claimed that laura was a heavy drug user. laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass laura. well, laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. not only that, but laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. my wife didn't know this at this point, but laura was pregnant. several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on laura behalf. 


using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. she did some more internet sleuthing and found laura's husband on facebook. laura's husband didn't have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. my wife sent him an email claiming that laura was cheating on him. the husband confronted laura about this email and laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  my wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. what she didn't realize was laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. she also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


my wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. one of laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. my wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) she did not make herself known immediately. instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. she was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about laura - my wife was telling people that laura didn't actually know who the father was, among other things. this was at an event where her husband was at as well. the word got back around to laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


i'm leaving a fair amount of information out - my wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in laura circle and sent them messages about laura on multiple occasions. all the messages were trying to paint laura in an extremely derogatory light. all the events i've mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  my wife didn't think to mask her ip address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same ip address, ours. many of laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. they had ample evidence against her. all the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. she even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife's accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


i honestly felt awful for laura, there were lots of tears on her end. you could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. she said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. she was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. and that my wife's harassment continued even after laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


my wife has never done anything this crazy before. i knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. we've had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. but, she really fucked up this time. i don't know how to move forward. i know someone is going to suggest therapy, but i really want to start building up an emergency fund again. we're pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** wife was sued by her former best friend, i emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. i need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. what can we do to move forward?",7

my sister and i spent the weekend after i posted researching local lawyers that were suggested by our insurance and found 3 we wanted to contact. 
the guy we went with is amazing and more vicious then the neighbors dog. 
he is also willing to take payment after a judgment or settlement and offered us a lower percentage then what we have researched is the norm. 

ends up his son had been attacked by an off leash dog once and he ""feels very strongly that irresponsible dog owners understand the repercussions of their actions and that the neighbor is a threat and this needs to be handled quickly.""

the neighbors mean dog has been put down.  she was deemed uncontrollable and not able to be rehabbed. 

we've seen the nice dog over the last few days with the roommate so she must have paid the fines to get her back. 

our lawyer responded to her case against me and confirmed we'd be meeting them in small claims court.  

she was also served with 2 separate lawsuits. 
one from myself with my medical cost including estimated long term cost, rehab cost, lost work/vacation days, pain and suffering, and destruction of property.  i'll explain the destruction of property shortly. 

one for my sister including estimated long term medical cost, lost work/vacation days, property damage (our dog), and pain and suffering. 

her lawsuit against me has a court date of march 5th.  after she was served with our lawsuits, she apparently desperately tried dropping the case against me but the prosecutor denied her request (didn't know they could do that).   she then tried contacting our lawyer multiple times to ask him to get the prosecutor to drop the case, he informed her that wasn't something he had control of and we'd still be moving forward with the 2 lawsuits against her. 

she finally got herself a lawyer and our lawyer was contacted with settlement offers that in his term were, ""laughable"" and we refused the settlement offers. 

our lawyer used past cases of dog attacks in nc where settlements of over 800k were paid out and that involved cases where the dogs owners actually tried to stop the attack.

now for some extra facts. 

my left wrist is going to need surgery that's scheduled to take place on february 27th. 

our dog had the drain removed from her neck and her skin graft is healing up nicely but she's still in a cast with pins in her paw.  the vet thinks she'll have a limp but will recover with no other long lasting injuries.  she still refuses to go out the back door anymore and will cry and plant if we try. 

the destruction of property in my claim comes from those cameras my boyfriend installed.  

the day after her dog was put down, she literally took a baseball bat to everything in our front and back yard.  she broke our porch railing, smashed all our flower pots, bent my hammocks metal base and used some kind of utility knife to slice up the hammock, tore the plants out of the ground in our garden (including pulling up imported maple trees), dumped some sort of substance that had a jelly like consistency into our koi pond killing all the fish, and broke various other things in our yard.  she straight up went on a rampage that was all caught on the cameras.  she also left 2 notes on our door, one threatened to shoot our dogs and that she'd have someone beat us up.  

we called the cops immediately and they took it seriously. they asked if we wanted to press charges and we did. 

our lawyer used the notes and camera footage to get an emergency protection order for us and we haven't so much as seen her since, though we see her car come and go. 

the video of the attack that the other neighbors son took was a pure godsend.  it shows how she just sat there and did nothing to try and stop the attack. it also shows her audibly laughing during it. she only started trying to help when i started smashing her dog into the ground. 

we also got statements from multiple neighbors and our lawyer is working on getting the multiple complaints from other families from the hoa. 

he said it's pointless to go after the hoa and we wouldn't get worth while results from them.  our lawyer did tell us that the hoa has started the eviction process against the neighbors but that could take a long time and can be contested. 

there was also a memo sent out to the neighborhood about leash rules and that there will be an upcoming vote about possibly muzzling dogs if they're in common areas outside of our private properties and other new neighborhood rules concerning pets. 

i honestly can't tell if this lady had some sort of mental breakdown or is just plain crazy. 

either way, my sister and i both have our separate court dates against her in mid and end of march. 

thank you all so much for your advice and guidance. you guys not only gave us the knowledge but the confidence to fight this and were both so grateful to you all. 

i'll be sure to update after the court dates and keep you guys up to date.  please feel free to ask any questions and i'll answer whatever i can.

"super awesome update sat down on my friend's macbook and broke it, offered to pay her the money for it but now she wants more because ""she was upgrading anyway"" so it's this or she will sue me in small claims court.. i never thought this would turn out the way it did and i really felt like i learned so much stuff in the process thanks to all of you. here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/641joo/sat_down_on_my_friends_macbook_and_broke_it/) is my previous question. 

i went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and i sincerely thank each and every one of you.

i did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it's around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so i wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, i'm withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. she sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she's going to take me to court.

i got served a few days later and went to court. i told the judge i gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current macbook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (i printed out the email i sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we'll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. i also told him that when i offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no i want the money in cash. when i told her i'd give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. i tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.

she gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case i guess. after listening to both of us he ruled that i pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. so i'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.

if it weren't for you guys i would've paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and i honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out. 

i feel good for following all the advice here.

"my lyft/uber expenses were nearly $750 every month so i instead bought a bike for $900 and now my travel expenses are <$140. i used to lyft line or uber pool to work everyday or every other day so this was nearly ~$10 everyday so $200-250/month just for that. in addition i use uber/lyft to get around the city for meeting up with friends, getting groceries, going to meetups etc and that added up a lot. i was so shocked by this because even though the charges are tiny up front they really add up. 

so a few months ago i invested in a nice road bike for $900 and its been solid so far and my lyft usage dramatically went down. if i am going somewhere <2.5 miles i bike. i live in sf so hills can get pretty crazy so i also avoid areas that are further in the city. its even cheaper than public transport - which would cost me close to $100 every month to get to work. instead monthly bike maintenance is <$10 and i can use public transportation to go further into the city. i only use lyft/uber now if i am drunk or need to get to places that neither public transport or my bike can.

something i thought this sub might enjoy

**edit:** a lot of questions around why i used lyft/uber and taxi so much when sf is such a walkable city and it has great public transportation. 

no real reason besides i was stupid and incredibly lazy with terrible habits. i moved to sf fresh out of college a year ago and i work in tech so the salaries are pretty good. i wasn't disciplined about my finances for a while - as a matter of fact i wasn't until the last few months and then expenses racked up and i started building a credit balance. i used to use public transportation a lot and then i moved to a place where it was a little far so i got lazy and started taking lyft and this became such a habit that 4-5 months in i was taking it everywhere. 

i also used to call it all the time whenever friends/family was in town and never split. $750 does say a lot about me. bad habits are so easy to foster. but now i am more disciplined in this matter. i was careless. but i am self-aware enough to call myself out - only in this case i could've done it early; but that's alright because i did and made a lot of progress. 

so if you are 22 and are like me and have bad habits that alright. call yourself out. block a few hours on a weekend, and do nothing but understand your financial habits and make a budget to the last penny. it might anxiety at first but then you'll get a hold over it and it'll be alright.

**edit:** holy shit. this got way more attention than i wanted. a lot of good advice - thank you for that. thank you to all the people that were being nice. to the ones that reached out to me to be mean - try to be nice. 

i did invest in a good u lock and i also have a cable lock. when i'm at work i take it straight to my desk but when i go grocery shopping i usually lock it with the u-lock and also use the cable lock with the tires. it worked well so far. 

i also cook everyday so that ~$50 a week on groceries and i eat out about ~30 worth every weekend. so about ~$350 in eating a month. a lot of people reached out asking for advice - i will get back to you this weekend. ",10

i'm disgusted.  it was her ex, whom i've always felt inferior too like she just hadn't gotten over him even after over a year.

i'm distraught.  i don't even have anyone else in my life rn.  my two best friends cut me off over something stupid a few weeks ago, i just moved into uni and i have only really ""clicked"" with one guy friend.  my family and i don't even get along nor communicate much.  i lost my confidant, my support system, and my best friend all in one night.

she's really sorry.  i saw her crying when she didn't know i could see her and she was hitting the steering wheel over and over again.  i feel bad but like the lying and deception isn't new.  i had to do it.  i told her we're over, but she's welcome to try to win me back or whatever idc.

but fuck this sucks.  i have mental health issues and so my coping skills are practically nil and i just don't know how to cope with this.  i can't eat.  i can't sleep and i have class in the morning.  i keep picturing the texts and visualizing him ""pounding"" her and i'm just disgusted.  i'm just obsessing over it and it's 4 am in the fucking morning.

part of me just wants to let it slide if she does show effort at getting me back.  i know in a while i'll be ok but i just don't know how to get from part a to part b.

"ne & co my mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. can she do that?. for some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. she has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since i've moved out for college. she demands access to absolutely everything i have. this will be important later.

&#x200b;

i'm 18 years old, and i'm a college freshman. i go to college in colorado, but i was born and raised in nebraska. in nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. it was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. like i said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when i do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200b;

my mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. email, whatsapp, facebook (even though i haven't used it in years), twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if i don't give it to her. in the past, i've rolled over and taken it. it was a survival mechanism more than anything. if i'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. she justifies this by claiming that because i have autism, i can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200b;

about a month ago, i changed all my passwords. sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that i need to give her my new passwords. i tell her no. this is where trouble begins.

&#x200b;

over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. she's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. a week ago, she showed up here and i had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. that pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200b;

recently, though, as in last night, i was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" i asked her to clarify and she said that because i'm still a minor in nebraska, and i'm a resident of nebraska, i have to abide by nebraska's laws and as such, i am still a minor and she can do that. i wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like i wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as i've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. it's not nice. i do not want to be gooned and taken home. i don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200b;

so the question is this: can she do that? is the fugitive slave act not dead after all? does my having autism change the circumstances any? if all else fails, what can i do to protect myself?",2

"by texting my pregnant wife that ""this isn't working"". my wife posted earlier today on la about this. not using my main because my fil knows it and i'm not quite ready to tell him about this.

i went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. i had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when i turned it on. most of them were asking how i could do this. i had no clue what she was talking about. she didn't answer any of my calls back.

i got home and she was packing up to leave. i'll admit it, i cried. a lot. had no clue what was happening or what i did. finally, it comes out that i texted her that i wanted a divorce. she showed me the text and i immediately realize what happened.

this morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. i texted her ""the new mirror came in! i'm going to try to put it together but i may need your help later"". i had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. i texted her, ""this isn't working, and at this point i think i need to just give up"". apparently, the first text didn't go through, just the second one. so my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while i was off thinking everything was great. she even called a divorce lawyer.

things are fine now but she's still crying off and on. she told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.

tl;dr accidentally told my wife that things weren't working, she almost left me.

edit: wow, this blew up. to address a few things that came up in the comments:

\-i usually work from home unless i need to meet with clients. i don't always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she's usually at work anyway. that's why she didn't know i was at work yesterday. i'm not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. if my phone goes off, i could lose my job, and our health insurance.

\-my wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. that's why she had the reaction she did.

\-my comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. neither of us is mad at the other. this was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. we're fine. i posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. no need to psychoanalyze my wife or pm me about divorce. we are fine.

"for demanding my sister pay rent for living-at-home with my parents and refusing to pay my rent until she does?. background: i graduated from college 4 years ago live at home with my parents. my sister graduated 2 years ago and also lives with my parents. we both got jobs pretty much straight out of college. i pay my parents $800/month in rent since my first paycheck.

this is a throwaway and it's still fresh and i'm really emotionally charged right now. last night my parents were talking loudly about their financial problems in the living room. i overheard and i offered to help by paying more in rent (i was thinking $900-1000) since it covers utilities/phone/internet. my parents were grateful. now, prior to this, i never asked my how much sister pays in rent. i always figured my parents charged us the same. so absentmindedly i asked a follow-up question.

me: how much is my sister paying for rent?

my mom: nothing.

a long ass pause.

me: what do you mean she doesn't pay rent?

my dad (visibly angry): your sister doesn't pay a fucking thing!

my dad explained how my sister recently bought a brand new car and hasn't paid insurance on it so my dad had to pay for it. she doesn't pay rent. she doesn't pay utilities/phone/anything. so for the past 2 years she's been living rent free while i've been paying my parents.

so later that night we had a family sit down talk. my sister didn't want to pay rent, especially at how much i was paying. she offered $100. my parents suggested she pay $300, i pay $800 which my sister and i both rejected.

the conversation ended with this:

sister: **fuck you. i'm trying to live my life.** these were her exact words which pissed me the fuck off to holy hell)

so my sister storms off to her room and it's now me, my parents in the living room. i'm extremely upset at this because it's massively unfair. my mom is upset that everyone's angry at each other and my dad's angry my sister won't pay rent and she won't move out and both my parents don't want to police involved.

so i say my part before leaving.

me: i'm not going to pay any more rent until she does. (it's only fair right?) and if i do pay rent, i pay whatever she's being.

my mom: what if she pays $300 and you pay $800-

me: no.

my mom: but me, we really need the money...

me: that's too bad.

i get up and go off to my room.

so this morning my dad comes in tells me that i'm an asshole for not paying rent. that i should pay rent because it's the right thing to do and all this shit. i'm like, ""what the hell? make my sister pay rent!""

my mom, who's listening in.

""you've seen her! she won't listen to us!""

me: well that's too bad.

my mom (really angry): well we wouldn't have this problem if you didn't try to make your sister pay rent.

that was the last straw that blew it for me. i slammed the door on my parents.

as i'm typing this my parents are in the living room discussing how both their children are rotten and shit was better back in the home country/back in their day when kids listened to their parents. like wtf?",3

so last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. i send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. it is. we're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... we came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

now the real fuck up. my wife is in the bed. i go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. just texted her and the thong is hers. the only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

you want me to believe that?! that makes no sense

jesus christ, i don't even believe my explanation myself. i tell her to believe what she wants, i don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that i don't have anything to redeem myself. i take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

the next morning she calls me. she tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that i'd put it in her drawer. and if i was cheating on her, i'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

tldr : found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. almost lost my wife to it.

edit : omg it exploded. thanks for the silver mystery redditors! i know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! had fun with the others that told similar stories :) and yes, i told my friend that i sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.

edit 3 : wow thanks for the gold! i answered to a bunch of you, but i'll not be able to keep up! there's too many comments! i hope you guys have a nice day!

edit4 : addressing some comments. no i don't think my friend did it on purpose to have my wife divorce me so she can have me all for herself. yes i have the right to hang out with other women and have a drink with them. my wife also has the right to hang out with other men and have a drink with them. finally, my friend's fabric softener is fleecy.",4
"if i started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?. i moved from georgia to the pacific northwest last year for a dream job after i graduated college. it was a little bit of a culture shock, because i went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. there hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. for example, every white woman i meet mentions beyonce to me within the first five minutes. when i was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'so... beyonce.'

so the problem in the post title is that i am the only black woman at my office, and i am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and i'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. my name is tina, short for christina. pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. for some reason, a handful of people at work call me tiana, tiara, or tia, i think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. i am most often called tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which i think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. the other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position i'm in) used to work there and i get called her name (mary) sometimes too. sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""how do you pronounce that?"" it's tina!

i have tried politely correcting this and i correct it immediately every time. from polite, ""just for the record, my name is tina!"" to lighthearted, ""tina, like tina belcher!"" in e-mails from me that say tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, i still get, ""thanks tiana!"" sooo... i'm considering doing the twitter approach, where i just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. like:

chuck: thanks, tiana

tina: no problem, chad!

jessica: hi tiara!

tina: good morning, jennifer!

would i be the asshole if i did this? i know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and i feel really disrespected by this, so i may as well have some fun with it.

edit: i am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so i just want to add a couple of things:

a lot of people have suggested that i gently and firmly remind people of my name. that's what i've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

a lot of people have suggested i go to hr. this is the kind of nebulous thing hr doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

a lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. it is. i have been black for 25 years, and i have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and i can identify it in my own life. it isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. i feel like a few people are almost getting it. a lot of people are referencing that key and peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

and finally, a few people have asked why i don't use tina turner as an example, since she's also a black tina. first, i thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with tina belcher, but i used 'tina turner' as an example for our dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me tina turner, which took deprogramming from his ea to get over.

edit #2:

no, i don't have a southern accent. i'm from atlanta, and black people from atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. more to the point, no accent makes the name 'tina' sound like 'tiana' or ""tiara""

no, the people i work with aren't just 'idiots.' as annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

no, i can't wear a 'hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. we have a business professional dress code!

yes, i correct them every time.

no, it's not because i'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

responding to this post saying, 'okay shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('tiana' being the 'shaniqua' in this instance). several people have alarmingly said, 'okay, trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'chad' is very weird!",3

"update: my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met. this is an update from my last post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a22u6h/my_girlfriend_is_acting_obsessed_with_this_random/

as a quick summary: i thought something weird was going on with my girlfriend ""maggie"" who became quickly and extremely close to her new co-worker ""joe"" and his wife ""kate."" after just a couple weeks, she was trusting joe with everything work related, babysitting their children for free and buying them gifts, having the kids call her auntie, putting this family above her other friends, inviting the family to maggie's family thanksgiving, and referring to them as her chosen family. i thought that either this whole thing was some kind of cover for an affair or maggie had attachment issues.

i figured out what was going on and i feel like a huge idiot. i went to see maggie to ask for an explanation and figured if i didn't like what i heard i'd break up with her, because either she was cheating or had an emotional issue i couldn't handle.

i had the opportunity when i saw the gifts maggie had gotten for joe and kate's kids. it seemed so strange for someone who doesn't really like kids that much to go so overboard for kids she just met. 

i asked maggie why she gave the kids such special treatment even though she doesn't really like kids that much. maggie explained that she felt differently about these kids because she had been around to watch them grow and was close to joe and kate, so the kids are more like family to her, which means she treats them differently than other kids and they're the exception to the rule. maggie said she'd probably tone it down eventually, but since they were so young she wanted to get them something really nice for christmas.

i wasn't really sure what to say next because it seemed so irrational, but then maggie said that she used to exchange christmas gifts with joe and kate too, but that they had all decided it was too much trouble and unnecessary so these days she usually bakes them something or gets them a nice bottle of wine.

i realized i was missing something important. if maggie had other christmases with joe's family, she couldn't have just met them like i thought. i had thought that maggie might have emotional issues that made her attach herself to people she barely knew, but i didn't think maggie was actually crazy enough to imagine that she knew them before. i didn't want to ask, so i acted normally until i left.

when i got home, i went through maggie's facebook. she wasn't lying and she's not crazy. i found a ton of photos with joe and kate going back a decade. from what i can figure out, they all went to college together, joe and maggie were big brother and little sister in a coed frat/sorority, and maggie and kate were roommates. i also found pictures of maggie as a bridesmaid in joe and kate wedding and pictures of maggie holding their newborn children so they are obviously close friends who have known each other for a long time. all of maggie's behavior makes perfect sense now that i know all this.

i think this whole thing is my fault. i have adhd and i don't handle it well. i've had issues when people are talking to me for awhile, where i start zoning them out. i've been called out for this before. i think it's pretty likely that maggie did tell me about joe and kate and i just wasn't listening. maggie hasn't actually done anything wrong or creepy so i think it's more likely that i wasn't listening when maggie explained instead of this being a trick.

this was a pretty big wakeup call for me. i've been ignoring my problem because i didn't want to face facts that it was serious but i know i need to do something before i make anymore mistakes. i'm going to start off by looking for a therapist.",7

"by wearing a shawl, which ruined my relationship with my gf. minor background: i am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. i'm 6'2 and have a pretty ""tough-guy"" background in that i was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but i also have thin wrists and sit on my friends' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. i'm not gay, i just am me.

so while i was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn't get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. mine makes me look like a star wars character and his looks like the outlaw josey wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. the first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. whatever. so i get a call from my gf, she's tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so i bid these mean girls and shawlbro adieu and head home.

i'm still wearing the shawl when my gf arrives and she's also really taken aback, she won't even kiss me until i take it off. we get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if i'm gay. and she's really serious and aggressive about it. i tell her i'm not, that if i was i'd definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that i own a shawl. anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she's sorry and that she ""needs to think about what kind of man"" she wants, and then doesn't contact me for days. so yesterday i invite her out, she's stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to the big city, but that she doesn't know this or that, and eventually i just tell her very politely to get fucked because i'm pretty insulted by this point. on the way back, now that i'm not directly in front of her, i get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she's just not that into me anymore because i wore a shawl.

later on, i tell shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.

we are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.

tl;dr: me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.

"vanilla coke is the best flavor, even better than the regular flavor of coke.. to begin, what the hell even is the flavor of regular coke? sugar? it's indiscernible and, frankly, a little bland. all you really get with the base flavor is fizz. 

with the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. the whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. like, really well.

in fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange coke (which just taste like regular coke with fruits shoved in them).  

the only real downfall to vanilla coke is that it's not wide-spread; only two stores in my town sell it, which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla coke is.

"i trash my coworkers mugs and dishes when they leave it soaking in the community sink.. at work we have a kitchenette and at the end of the day, my coworkers leave their dishes/mugs filled with oatmeal and other things left to soak.  we even have a sign that states ""do not leave personal belongings in the kitchenette.  we are not responsible for lost items"". i stay at work pretty late so i see the night janitor come in and clean.  i noticed that he goes out of his way to wash the dishes and mugs, which isn't a part of his job (our company only contracts them to do floors and trash so it's our responsibility to clean up after ourselves). my coworkers must have noticed too because they have since stopped doing their own dishes and has been leaving piles in the sink knowing that they will be magically washed and dried in the morning.  they even make comments about the ""mexican sucker"" that's cleaning for them.  this has been on going for a few weeks now and my coworkers even have the audacity to complain about water spots on their mugs.  so throughout the day when i find myself alone in the kitchenette, i take an item or two and toss them out in the building hallway trash so it can't be found. we work in a building where we share office space with other businesses and there's no cameras so i haven't been caught yet.  a coworker asked our manager about their items being taken, but my manager just reiterated the policy.  i guess i am being petty, but my coworkers are trash and i don't feel bad.

"i don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.. using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't i? if i contended this in public, i'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. but from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. here's why.

&#x200b;

**1,153.** that's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per the washington post.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) this averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - terrorism.** let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on united states soil in 2016. this is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. source(https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - falling.** whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 us lives in 2011. the amount of fucks i give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around mercury. so why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   source(https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - diabetes.** if you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. source(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200b;

and, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **airplane/spacecraft crash** \- 26 deaths
* **drowning in the bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **getting struck by a projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **pedestrian getting nailed by a lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **accidentally strangling yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200b;

now, here's a new york times article(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*new reality for high school students: calculating the risk of getting shot.*"" complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? what it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the washington post:(https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>that means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killed by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughly 1 in 614,000,000**. and since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. the chance of a child being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200b;

in percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. it's a number so remarkably small that every calculator i tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. there is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",6
"reddit not covering the sri lanka bombings the same way it covered the new zealand shootings is dirty politics.. the 'front page of the internet' shouldn't be censoring breaking news just because it might trigger a few muslims. they carried out the terrorist attacks and should be condemned as much as the white mass-shooter.

i am not pro/anti-white, anti/pro-christian, or anti/pro islam.

me: sure. look there's one thing though. she's not thin. if you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we're done, we're going home. i love her. and she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so i expect you to show her the same respect. 


mom: but you have so many prospects and a good job why would you—

mom: fine. i'm just happy i finally get to meet her. 


dad: *insulting weight related comment*


me: what the fuck dad? 


mom: oh babe give it a rest, it can't be that bad. 


me: no if there's any chance of that sort of commentary, i'll just not come. i have zero tolerance for this. you're going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won't get the chance to screw it up. 


dad: *insulting joke* 



me: ok, bye. if you wonder why brother is buying a tux for a wedding you've heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



mom: no, wait, i'll make sure his act is together by the time you're out here. 


dad: *insulting comment* 



me: i'm hanging up. 


so it looks like i'm going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. probably not soon. my girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and i started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said ""it would be nice if i could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won't be possible and it definitely isn't worth putting you through this.""

so thanks for the comments and help. for now it's a non issue it turns out.

i was at a party and saw a girl across the room. she was wearing a skirt, holding a drink in one hand and had the other hand in her pocket. i saw her skirt, thought to myself how cool that skirt is having pockets. a lot of women i know complain about not having pockets, so this is a very progressive thing.

a bit later, i got around to talking to her. i complimented her skirt, and how pockets in a skirt is great. she looked very confused, said ""my skirt doesn't have pockets, why would you think that?"" i mentioned that i had seen her earlier with her hand in her pocket. her face went bright red and revealed that her hand was amputated. what i thought was her hand in her pocket, was her stump resting against her hip.

i apologised immediately, but luckily she thought it was funny because she'd never heard that comment before. i'm still dying inside though.

2. read dave ramsey's money makeover. it's got good tips and the tactics work. 

3. the jones' can suck it. they're miserable and controlled by debt also. don't buy things you don't need to compete with people you don't care for anyways. 

4. pick up a side hustle. i taught myself to make skateboards, and would handmake 2-3 a week to sell to help pay off the debt. my wife picked up birth photography 

5. talk to your boss, ask what you can do to take a bigger paycheck home. 

6. be a bitch about your budget. set it and don't stray from it. 

7. put post-it notes with $0.00 written on them at the office, in your car, on your mirror, on your phone background. seeing that everywhere actually reminded me of my goal of achieving $0.00 cc debt. not sure if it legit made a difference but i think it might've 

8. become emotionless toward money. i would get so pissed that i was dumping hundreds of my paycheck into debt payoff. it was only till i stopped giving a f#&@ that it became easier to make bigger payments. 

9. save nothing until it's paid off. it doesn't make sense to save money when you have cc debt growing exponentially in the opposite direction. 

10. when in doubt... overpay. if you run short on money in your checking, but whoop, dip into the cc for 50 bucks. keep basically nothing in your bank account because ""you spend what you have."" my family could live off of $75 a week. but if we have $300 to live off of, guess what... we would use $300. so i would always put as much as made sense. a few times i overpaid but it forced us to be frugal. 

11. unsave your cards on amazon. so if you go to buy something you have to go through the hassle of finding the card and filling in the fields. 

these are just some of the silly things i picked up along the way that i think would've helped me stay out of the mess. we are so happy now that we worked our butts off to become financially stable. i hope this helped!

lots of people seem offended at, ""explain how broke you are."" that was meant to be a little tongue in cheek, guys. the lpt is for talking about money if someone says, ""yeah well i only made $10/hour in the 60s,"" or something similar.   it's just an idea about how to get everyone on the same page.

"i made a spreadsheet for people who don't know how to budget!. hey guys! last year i made a spreadsheet to help myself budget- i'm terrible at sticking to a budget so i made a sheet that breaks it down so that i just have the ability to break it down to a daily manageable amount.

heres what it looks like(https://imgur.com/a/ojaju7a)

i grew up very poor and had no sense of what or even how to start budgeting. i was taught that money would disappear if i didn't use it, so i just used it. even now i still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if i'm not careful. another problem i faced is that i have adhd, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. this spreadsheet is made so you only focus on one number.

&#x200b;

the sheet was set up with three goals in mind:

&#x200b;

1. that it be easy to use
2. that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals- instead of a long term budget that doesn't have daily support
3. that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before

&#x200b;

so how does it work?

the main budget is divided into three core areas:

&#x200b;

* income: you use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly pay cycle. if you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips, my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips- so for example, if you usually make 100 from tips a week, even if you get extra, try to program your budget around the 100 minimum average.
* expenses:  there you can add your expenses. utilities are bills that are for electricity, heat, phone, internet, or water. bills are important expenses that you can't miss and are integral to living. finally, expenses are other things you need to allocate money for- whether it be gas, lunch expenses, transportation- ect. within your expenses there are two areas to which you need to pay attention:-credit card payments: this is new to this year's sheet, use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards. decide whether to pay the minimum payment or choose an amount to pay. the tab will allow you to see how much you're paying and how much interest you're accruing.  once you have filled it out, your budget will adjust accordingly.-big purchase: use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase, and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase!
* budget summary:  finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary- here you will see just how much you can spend. this money is shown in three ways, the lump monthly sum, a weekly amount, or a daily amount. as long as you don't go over that number, you will have enough money for the rest of your budget. it will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it, where your money is going, and what your income vs spending is!

&#x200b;

~~here is a link to the sheet~~(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ycjtrgvkum7sixilsaqnlhxwemh-qgbeulzbm5bedmg/copy)

&#x200b;

ou use it like this

* go in
* make a copy
* change the numbers
* decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved
* budget.

the sheet includes three charts:

* a bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving
* a pie chart to see where your money is distributed
* a daily pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings

i don't work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture. by giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i haven't spent more than i'm allowed to- and if i do i can see where i'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

"i once skunked a bottle of wine given to a bullying manager on my team then gave it to her. many moons ago i was working for a large technology company. it was common practice for managers on the same team to exchange some sort of token holiday gift just before christmas - something under $20. 


one of these managers was a very nasty woman who was quietly bullying some of her employees and one of the other managers on our team. we were trying to deal with her through the proper channels but, the holidays sprang up in the meantime. 


when the holidays came around, i bought a case of a nice red wine that i enjoyed and prepped them all with giftbags. except one bottle - the bottle for the nasty manager. 


i took that bottle and spent about two weeks heating the bottle and chilling the bottle by wrapping it in a particularly warm heating pad and standing it on top of my old apartments hot water heater for one or two hours then sticking it in the freezer until the bottle was cold to the touch. my goal was to ruin the wine, turn it to vinegar. 


the holidays came and i gave my fellow managers their gift wine and we all headed out of the office for a few days for company-wide ooo. 


when we came back everyone was talking about how wonderful the wine was. except the nasty manager, who was surprised everyone loved it. she was going on about how nasty it was and how bad it smelled and how she couldn't even drink it. 


it was intended as a harmless prank but, when she was fired a few days later for bullying people, she exploded and mentioned my ""shitty wine"" in her tirade as she threw things around the office on her way out the door. i felt some degree of pride about that because fuck her for bullying people.

both my parents had other children, my dad's side knows nothing about me but my siblings on my mum's side were told that i am adopted by my grandparents. recently i decided that i wanted to know more about my dad's family and i sent a friend's request to one of my siblings and my dad so i could get to know him. well he freaked out and contacted my birth mum and they asked to speak to me over skype. they both told me that they couldnt risk staying in contact with me and told me that they were going no-contact and to please respect it and move on with my life. 

well i did pretty much the opposite. i contacted my dad's wife and shared screen shots of our conversations and told her everything. she is now divorcing him while on my mother's side i told both my siblings who then went on to tell extended family including her husband's side so now they are seperated and my siblings hate my mother.

"wife told me she wanted to experiment, i obliged, then she attempted to eat my feces.. throwaway account because my wife follows my regular account here. my (28m) wife (26f) and i have admittedly had very vanilla sex throughout our 3 year marriage. we had our first kid a year ago and it seriously slowed down our sex life. however, a little under a month ago she approached me about ""trying new things"". she has been hanging out with a group of moms in our neighborhood and one of them told her that she and her husband tried pegging and it completely transformed their marriage. my wife told me that she wanted to try pegging as well to ""spice things up"". at first i thought it was a joke, but soon realized she actually wanted to peg me. i had never done assplay before and had always lived by the philosophy that the anus is solely an exit, but my wife made it clear that this was important to her so after a few days i obliged.

that next weekend, she pegged me and everything was surprisingly enjoyable. additionally, the week following the pegging was one of the best weeks we've had together since the birth of our child. we were back to our old sex life, doing things like having sex before work and even waking each other up with head. however, that next weekend she told me she wanted to peg me again. i was slightly confused as to why this last week of sex wasn't cutting it for her, but i agreed.

this is when things took an extreme turn. during this second pegging while my wife was inside of me, she grabbed my hair, craned my neck to the right, and pressed our foreheads together. i had never seen her take control like this and thought it was very hot until she looked me in the eye and whispered ""i want your shit"". i pulled my face away and asked her to repeat and she said ""i want you to shit on me"". i pushed her off of me and asked her if she was joking and she started crying. i felt like a fucking dick because she thought i was kinkshaming her. in a way, i was because i thought the request was far too extreme. i ended up leaving for the night and stayed with one of my close friends, but didn't tell him what happened.

after that incident, my wife and i hardly talked all week unless it related to our son. at the end of the week, i asked my wife to talk about what happened. she told me again that she wanted me to shit on her and that it meant a lot to her. i thought it was sickening, but she claimed this was her deepest, darkest kink. i couldn't understand how and why my shit excited her, but she insisted that she has always wanted this.

we fought about this for about a week and after watching some scat porn and reading articles by people who also shared this kink, i tried to put myself in my wife's shoes. i told her that i will shit on her if that is what will turn her on. she was so happy and even though i was still completely nauseated by this desire, i wanted to satisfy her.

that brings us to tonight. we were having sex for the first time this week when i (regrettably) confessed to her that i had to take a shit. she perked up with a smile, sensed my discomfort, and began stroking my hair and whispering encouraging things to me. i still really didn't want to go through with it, but since i had promised her i pulled out and we ran to the bathroom.

she got into the bathtub and i hung my ass over the side of the tub. i started pushing, but unsurprisingly found it very difficult to successfully shit on my wife. i turned my head around to see my wife staring up and smiling at me waiting for me to finish. with enough time, i was finally able to get a turd to start coming out. i could hear my wife breathing heavier beneath me as my asshole started opening. however, before the turd was able to drop on her chest, i felt a sensation around my asshole.

i turned around and saw my wife - the love of my life, the mother of my son - attempting to catch my turd in her mouth as it fell out of my asshole. i was horrified that she would try to do this, and tried to pull the shit back into my body so she couldn't receive it in her mouth. seeing what looked like an attempt by her to eat my shit brought me close to throwing up.

as i clenched my buttcheeks together to try to stop the shit from reaching my wife, the clenching cut off a very small piece of my shit and i heard it land somewhere beneath me. i was too scared and disgusted to look at my wife to see what she had done with it, so i ran to the other bathroom to clean myself. as i was sitting in the other bathroom thinking about how i will ever be able to look my wife in the eye again, i heard footsteps approaching. my wife lightly knocked on the door. i didn't respond and was on the verge of throwing up the more i thought about what just happened. she walked away and then i got a text from her thanking me for fulfilling her wish and asking me to come to bed.

i've been sitting in the living room typing this for the last half hour scared to face my wife. we have plans to take our son to the zoo with another family tomorrow, but i don't think i can look at her after what she did to me. i feel deceived and violated by the woman i love and trust. during our initial conversations about this, there was never a question that my shit would go anywhere other than her chest. she knew how uncomfortable i was with this in the first place, yet she still tried to push the boundary that we had established.

i would appreciate any feedback from anyone who has experienced a similar violation of trust from a loved one. i'm turning to this sub for advice because for obvious reasons, i cannot tell anyone that knows my wife and i. i know that some of you may find this humorous, but please serious comments only - this is something that could lead to the end of our marriage.

edit: a lot of people are saying ""why not both"", but the answer is in the post. being obese has a direct correlation to disease and living a shorter amount of time, so i feel like it shouldn't be accepted (with the exception of metabolic diseases that cause obesity)

"update pa i followed and reported a drunk driver, then i got a ticket for driving past curfew. this is an update to my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/az9zvq/i_followed_and_reported_a_drunk_driver_then_i_got/).

i took the advice that i was given and i pled not guilty. last week i went to court, and here's what happened:

&#x200b;

i brought copies of my cell phone's call log (showing that i called 911 before curfew) as well as the same records from my carrier. i also got a copy of the drunk driver's criminal complaint with the help of the court clerk, and i printed out a copy of the ""justification"" law(https://www.legis.state.pa.us/cfdocs/legis/li/conscheck.cfm?txttype=htm&ttl=18&div=0&chpt=5&sctn=3&subsctn=0).

the hearing started with the officer saying that i was pulled over on the side of the road, that he ""went to investigate"" why i was there, and that i voluntarily confessed to driving past curfew. he said that that was all he needed to prove in order to prove my guilt and basically left it at that.

then it was my turn to speak. i said that while i did drive past curfew, it was because i had noticed an erratic driver and i was following him because i thought he was going to hurt someone. i felt that if i had let the man go, that he would kill somebody and that 911 had told me to keep following him. i gave my evidence to the judge and to the police officer, and i said that i would have been home on time if not for the drunk driver. i argued that i had a reasonable belief that the man was very drunk and that the police are accusing the driver of having a .12 bac. (the judge asked the officer about the driver and he confirmed the bac.)

finally, i brought up the justification defense. i argued that driving past curfew was a summary offense and that drunk driving was at minimum a misdemeanor and at worst a 1st degree felony if he killed someone. i said that the law clearly provided a defense to my conduct because drunk driving was clearly the greater of the two evils and because i drove in an otherwise safe manner.

the judge agreed and found me not guilty! he said that i had proven my defense by a preponderance of the evidence and that i had done the right thing. i'm going to get my collateral back in the mail in a few days and my record is clean!

&#x200b;

tl;dr: went to court. police officer basically said ""the law is the law."" i presented my defense that i was preventing a greater harm under the justification law. judge agreed; i was found not guilty!",2

i contacted and met with a lawyer, and explained the situation to him. he seemed to agree that something was very fishy. to make a long story short, the woman ""handling our case"" has no affiliation with dcs. 

i'm still in complete shock.

one post mentioned how my family, including me, were out of town due to me playing sports. that was the night he said he would finally commit suicide. he mentioned either pills or knives and it still haunts me to this day. i was obscenely scared when i found this post, and was home alone and vowed to myself to never let anyone know that i found this. to this day, my parents do not know, and have tried to keep me in the dark about his struggles with mental health as much as they can, and my brother most definitely does not know. the only person who knows is my now long term girlfriend, and now you guys. i feel awful for never telling anyone in my family, and i feel like this has taken a toll on my own mental health, which in itself is not in a good state at all.

"by destroying the entirety of my family for only $99. throwaway account.

we've all been seeing the recent craze of dna testing and whatnot, so my dad and i decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. we got our results back a few days ago and i went into the dna relatives section to check out my matches. at the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% dna with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. this didn't make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. my cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. we're supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.

i couldn't think of a genetic relationship that would explain what i was seeing and i had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. the only realistic explanation for what i was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin's father and my dad's brother, is my father. reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. all the dots lined up and i felt a sense of *loss*. i sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then i had a feeling of anger come over me. i needed some fucking answers. 

without even thinking, i rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. my mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. she had no idea my dad and i had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. my mother and i never had a 'traditional' relationship. she was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. 

my irrational self didn't even sugar coat it. i asked her if she cheated on dad with uncle david (name changed for obv reasons). i have never seen the color drain from someone's face so quickly. she looked dumbfounded and then mumbled ""what kind of question is this? of course not."" i told her everything; the test, percentages, dna matches, all of it!! shit hit the fan. my mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. 

i left her there and went back into my room. i called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. she ended the call screaming. dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what's wrong with mom. i told him everything too. he didn't say anything after calming down. he left the room and i locked the door. 

for the next few hours, i heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. my parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. my aunt in law and david showed up shortly later and i'm pretty sure i heard my dad and david get into some physical fight. utter chaos. 

i feel like fucking shit. ik it's not my fault but i can't help feeling that this is all because of me. if i had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. i'm too scared to go outside. i don't even know what the outcome was. the only noise i hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and i sure my dad is out of the house. fuck my life

tldr; mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. i take a dna test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. i've locked myself in my room and i'm pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside

so, flashback to undergrad, things are good and i just started dating this beautiful girl that i had met in class. i was enamored with her, shocked that i loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. the first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&#x200b;

after a few months into our relationship, i started to notice some concerning symptoms. as you can probably hypothesize, when i pee'd, it burned. at first, i just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, i decided to stop taking creatine just in case. but, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. i would literally be struggling to stand while i pee'd because the pain was so intense. after, i would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. it was bad.

well, at this point, i was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. no, it had to be what i thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. i hadn't been with anyone else. i hadn't been with anyone else since i began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. i was shocked. things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had i gone wrong? the thought made my blood boil, until i outright confronted her. i told her i knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. she told me no. i demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. she said sure. (looking back at this i feel like a complete dick). we agreed that we would go the next day.

&#x200b;

the same night i confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. she was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. around this time my roommates and i had just moved into a new house. in the process all our belongings got shuffled around. as she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" i heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, i've been pissing out bleach?!?! i instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. she took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr - months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when i pee'd. i told my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an std test. the night before we went, i inadvertently discovered that i had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap.

"ne poisoned at family dinner. i'm currently on vacation visiting family for christmas. i'm 20 f a vegan by choice (however i am allergic to red meat.... i was bitten by a ""lone star tick"" which caused me to develop a severe allergy to meat) 
my family makes fun of me for being vegan (though i cook for myself for all meals and don't mention it much at all) anyway, i guess some of my extended family didn't know the severity of my allergy because my younger cousin 16 m chopped up steak (extremely finely i guess) and put it in my butternut squash soup.
shorty after i ate some of my soup i couldn't breath and was breaking out in hives. i woke up in the hospital on christmas day. (my mom called an ambulance when she saw my face was swelling). my cousin didn't say sorry when i started breaking out in hives. he started laughing and told me what he had done.
i woke up to a text from him saying ""stop overreacting you need protein"" with a picture of a slaughtered cow. his parents aren't very well off (in fact i don't think they have insurance). i just want to know, should i pursue a legal case? or is that an overreaction.

"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) found an engagement ring i was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. she thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.. i've been dating my girlfriend laura for just over two years. we met as i was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. we have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and i love her a great deal. she's definitely been the healthiest relationship i've ever had and i see a strong future with her. 

this weekend has been awful, however. my best friend rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend grace of about seven years. the problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. i offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. i hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last monday when he asked for it back. he (successfully!) proposed to grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

literally five minutes after she posted, laura rang me absolutely fuming. she told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had i given it to rob for grace when i'd clearly chosen it especially for her? was grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? i tried to talk her down and explain that i'd just been keeping it safe for rob and that i'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that i'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. she hung up on me, then texted me that i had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

am i wrong for thinking this is a red flag? i know that she probably was really excited and i absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. we don't live together and i don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. more than that, i am 100% not ready for marriage. we've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. i want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

what do i do? i totally understand why she'd be upset but i just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that i'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. this is the first big fight we've had and i'm not sure if i'm just seeing red flags because i'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

tl;dr: girlfriend snooped and found a ring that i was keeping safe for a friend. she's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by valentine's day or the relationship's off. need help determining what my next move should be.",7

"by sending nudes to my employee group chat.. tldr at the bottom- 

well i recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). with that being said i'm pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. i also mostly work with other men, 30-40. 

we have a groupme for the store i work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.
the previous night i had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that i was with at the time. no biggie right? 
the next morning i had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. noon rolls around and i needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue i was having with a computer i was working on. 
i typed what i needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as i clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, i hit send without thinking and go on about my day. i should also probably say that by this time i was working alone and closing so no one else was around. the customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left i went to check my phone and saw i had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first i thought he was just calling me about the question i had, while the phone was ringing, i went back to look at the groupme, to my horror i clicked not just a picture from the night before, but the whole damn video. my heart dropped, instantly when i realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my ""intentions"" where with the video and that he's never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. i tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. lol on the bright side the coworker i had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼‍♀️😂 


tldr: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out i send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end!

"i suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. i managed to procure specimen in question. what do i do now?. not sure if this is the right subreddit. sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and i don't know what to do. let me break down some background first:

&#x200b;

my dad is currently dying of liver failure. he's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  we have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. the man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. he's taking light doses of morphine and lorazepam so that he can sleep. the consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to thanksgiving....

&#x200b;

my step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  there was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (my dad would be the 5th man)

she's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. not through any vet or other official. she is barred from every animal shelter and adoption agency in the state as a result.

so with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200b;

she brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. he was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. in a matter of less than a minute after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction i've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. before i even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""do you see the light yet??? do you see all the pretty angels??"" (wtf????). he's been in an essentially catatonic state since. out cold for the past 12 hours. it was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. in tears, i begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. i was truly scared and genuinely thought i was going to lose him right then and there. we called hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. they are on staff 24/7). she wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

but he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and nothing like this has ever happened. i'm just a lay person, but that did not seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened immediately following the food, like flipping a light switch.

maybe i'm crazy. maybe i'm reading too much into it.  but i managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. my first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? is that even a thing? do i take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? a hospital?

with him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

&#x200b;

again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, i probably wouldn't think anything of it....

&#x200b;

any and all feedback would be much appreciated. i'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",2
"tifu by sending my wife a random dick pic. so this afternoon my wife was out at the pharmacy that's less than three minutes from our house.  she called because our insurance card wasn't working and asked for the numbers on the new cards we had just been issued. i started to read the numbers to her but she interrupted saying it would just be easier if i took a picture. to be funny i included my man parts in the photograph.  when she got home, i asked her how she liked the picture i had sent. she seemed genuinely clueless and didnt know what i was talking about.  apparently she just handed the phone with the picture open to the pharmacist to grab the numbers off himself.

"can't wait until thursday....my(48m) wife(44f) is going to be shocked. **\*\*\*update\*\*\***(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b9v8sv/update_dont_want_to_have_a_clickbait_title_wifes/)

so, wife and i have been together 17 years.  we are still stupid for each other, and she is the absolute love of my life, best friend, confidant, and co-conspirator.  about two years ago she started having joint aches and pains, and some minor swelling in her hands, wrists, ankles, etc.  so off we got to the gp, who gives us a consult to a rheumatologist.  come to find out, she has rheumatoid  arthritis, no worries, she starts treatment.  fast forward to a month ago, when our north texas weather decided to go full mental, and start changing temps and rain/weather by the hour it seemed.  she woke up after overnight temp changes and thunderstorms, and her hands were huge, worse, her small petite fingers looked like sausages.  and even though she had been previously warned about this, had slept in her wedding ring.  so, off to the doctors office....where they had to cut off her ring.  so, now for the bad, our rings were special ordered from ireland and custom designed, and have words in gaelic around the exterior of the ring, negating any type of ""repair"", and they were designed and made......17 years ago.  she was absolutely gutted.  i assured her we would figure it out, and it wasn't a big deal, but i could tell, to her, it was.

begin sherlock holmes mode.  i googled until i couldn't google anymore.  i was able to find that the original jeweler had closed up shop 10+ years ago just due to age.  i searched some more.  i finally found his personal facebook page, and i message him, and wait......and wait......

i finally get a response from his daughter, that she had noticed a pending message on her da's page, and that he passed away just six months ago.  i express my condolences, and she asks what was the purpose of my inquiry.  i go into this long diatribe about what had happened, etc.  she tells me she understands, and is so sorry about what had happened.

fast forward a couple of weeks.  i get a message on facebook from an unknown person, until she explains this was the daughter of the jeweler.  she explains that she went through all her dads designs and looked up the approximate dates, and thinks she found the drawings, details, and molds in her dads things, and wanted me to confirm.  she sent pictures, and i confirmed that yes - those are our rings!  she said she would get all of this to us as soon as possible, and asked for our address.

i open my email this morning to find tracking information, and pictures.  of our rings.  she went ahead and had her brother, who had taken over her fathers business make our wedding bands again, in her original size, and two extra in two larger sizes in case her condition causes her fingers to swell/change, and mailed them out to us, at no charge.  i asked why they did both as mine was fine, and she said it would not be fair that my wife had to have a new ring, and i was allowed to keep my old one.  she told me we needed to put our original set away, and to enjoy our new wedding bands.  i asked about compensation, and she said she was honored to keep her dads work and spirit alive.

our ""new"" wedding bands will be here thursday.

trying to think of romantic way to present her with them as she has no idea any of this took place.

\*edit - i rarely keep anything from her, but didn't want to tell her i was trying only for her to be ultimately disappointed.  the absolute hardest thing for me from now until they arrive will be to not tell her as we tell each other everything.  so now i not only need to figure out how to do this, but not to spill the beans until then.  (our friends nicknamed us mickey and mallory as well as marshall and lilly from ""how i met your mother"", because we literally tell each other everything)

\*edit 2 - i thought about taking her to our local favorite restaurant, where i actually proposed to her, she's a nurse (va nurse - how we met 18 years ago), and so always goes to the bathroom to wash her hands prior to ordering, when i originally proposed, i waited until she got up to wash her hands, dropped her ring in her wine glass, and....""waited"".....am thinking of a repeat.

\*edit 3 - and to those of you saying ""i"" am awesome, not in the slightest.  she is my world, she brought two sons to this add water family that were my pleasure to raise, and are now my best friends.  she is the reason i breathe, and supported all of us when i went back to school to achieve my two doctorates to advance my career.  she is my hero.  i wake up every day to earn her all over again.  this was one small thing i was able to do to bring her happiness, her joy is why i have a heartbeat.  and i don't give  a good flying f\* at a rolling donut if i seem sappy.  if a man isn't allowed to get sappy over his wife, he shouldn't have one.

tl;dr wife had to have rings cut off due to swelling from arthritis, i went hardy boys and found original jeweler, who had passed away, daughter found original molds/order, and recreated rings without my knowledge and mailed them out.  was seeking advice on how to give her the new wedding bands.

"by trying to play my dad's didgeridoo.. so my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in australia 10+ years ago. my parents wanted to go out for a walk but i decided i'd eaten too much cheese and couldn't be arsed. while they were out the internet went down so i was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when i spotted the didg. i thought to myself in all these years i've never actually tried to play it (it's more of a decoration and i barely take it in when i see it) and maybe it's time. i pick it up and put it to my lips. i felt like i knew what i was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. i take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. i splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. at first i thought it was saliva and ignored it as i had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. it felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. i glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. the second i clock what's happened i feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. i have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. i run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. i urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. i don't think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

according to her, this affair has been going on for years and she also told me that her husband was my daughter's biological father. she confronted her husband and he didn't deny anything.

i wanted to say thank you to everyone that has offered me support. it has really helped me get through all of the self-doubt i have been facing. he really had me questioning this entire situation and whether i was overreacting or not. i am going to confront my boyfriend later this evening. i can update again afterwards.
thank you again to everyone that has shared words of support and advice, it truly means a lot. even if my opinion isn't valid to him, at least it's valid to all of you!


i don't want to cause any political debates. if it's necessary for context: obviously i believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

i'm so confused, i don't know what to think. i'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but i just feel that i need some advice.

in the time i have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so i thought. politics was never an issue between us at all. however he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are american) and that they should not be allowed to vote... he says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

i'm upset and i can't tell if i'm wrong to be upset about this because i know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now i just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. he has assured me that he still thinks that i should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

this is a person i have been with for almost 5 years. we've talked about marriage. i don't know what to think. in all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and i can't imagine my life without him in it. but this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

am i wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? as his girlfriend am i supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though i may (strongly) disagree? i can't tell if i'm overreacting to this or not. the whole situation has made me feel terrible and i'm so confused.",7

after promising it most likely would not result in another hospital trip, she said yes! we're going out this friday for a dinner. i know some people warned me about dating people at work, but honestly after what i happened i think i'm kinda obligated by the universe to go for it.

so remember ladies and gents, if you ever have a crush on them, fucking dab on them. if it works with the haters, it'll work with the lovers.

"my little brother became a transwoman. she's incredibly pretty and it's killing me inside with jealousy as her sister.. i'm drunk and this is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

like the title says, my little brother (who was always the favorite one) came out to my family three years ago as trans and started her hormone therapy to become a woman. it was a bit of a shock but i love my brother(/sister) and i wished the best for her. my parents were another story and essentially disowned her and never spoke of her again.

since then, she's went through insane changes on her hormones, gotten surgery (voice change and adam's apple removal), and now she's fully passing as a woman. but she passes too well, like she's turned into fucking levels of fashion model pretty and it's pissing me off so fucking much. it's like hormone therapy gave her the face the females have in my family, but with all the right proportions and then made her look younger by a decade... whenever we hang out, guys start talking to her and flat out ignoring me (ie i don't exist apparently). i've always been considered to be the ugly duckling between the two of us (before she was a she), and now she's considered the ""hot"" sister. 2 months ago, she's turned into a literal fucking model after someone came up to her on the street and asked her to audition for a new ad campaign (for a fucking clothing chain). they had no clue she was trans because by now she's changed all her id to her new gender. i feel so guilty for thinking this, but i was secretly hoping that she would at least have some trouble with passing as a woman because i've been shit on and bullied for my looks (family, friends, everyone) since i was a kid while he's always had a girlfriend/been good looking/hyper popular/better grades.

but no i'm still the ugly one with horrible cramps that leave me paralyzed whenever its shark week and she's the one getting modeling gigs while hot guys message her non-stop. i'm trying to be there to support her because she has no one else to turn to for family but her fucking face is on billboards and bus ads now smirking back at me daily. she asks me for advice and confides me in me about things that i've never even had opportunity to have. what made me start drinking tonight was that she asked me what she should wear to an upscale party (something i've never been to) on some fucking rooftop penthouse with billionaires and actors. at first i kept my calm but then she went through the ""budget"" the clothing company gave her (20k+) for the night and her measurements (so i'm also morbidly fat apparently). i had to make up an excuse to leave, immediately went home and started taking shots of vodka. it's petty to think this way but i fucking hate my life right now.

"ups just knocked on my door and i received a massive check in the mail: is this safe to deposit?. hey everyone,

&#x200b;

so lately money has been pretty tight for me, i lost my job a few months ago and have been trying to uber full time to keep up payments, but its been an uphill road. recently i posted on craigslist attempting to sell my switch and xboxone, and made a deal with someone where they claimed they'd be sending me a check in the mail...

&#x200b;

so when ups showed up with an envelope i wasn't surprised. however, this check is written by the **harama entertainment corp**, for $1,550. i was only selling the consoles for $450 total. does anyone have any idea where this could have come from? is it safe to deposit? the check had no context attached to it, just the oversized ups express envelope. this seems a little too good to be true...

**update:** /u/sirglass hit it right on the money, the buyer wants me to ""hold"" the cash until his ""shipper"" can pick up the switch and the extra money in the check. i'm shredding the check and relisting my consoles asking for cash only next time. i really was trying to talk myself into thinking this could be my debt relief, but this is clearly a scam. thanks to everyone for keeping me sane.

**edit 2:** for those asking how anyone could fall for a scam like this or even consider it, it's a mixture of desperation and feeling ignorant about banking matters. as a student with bills being automatic and rent going through venmo i didn't immediately see the check as a red flag, just an ""older"" way of paying for things. also when everyone else was trying to lowball me, this guy offers me the asking price which made me want to deal with him. honestly if the check had been the exact amount and not $1,100 more i probably would have just went straight to the bank.",10

edit: this post got more traction than i was expecting. i'd really like to thank all of the librarians/tax-payers out there who got me to where i am. i grew up in a smallish town of 20k and moved to a bigger suburb later. from elementary school through medical school, libraries have helped me each step of the way.

they've had dramatic changes over the years. in high school, only the nerdy kids would go to the library (on top of the senior citizens and young families). a decade later, i can see that the the library has become a place to hang out. it's become a sort of after school day care for high school kids. many middle/high school kids have lan parties. smaller kids meet up together with their parents to read (and sometimes cry). my library has transformed from a quiet work space to more of a community center over the past decade.

even though i prefer pin-drop silence, i have no issues with these changes. **it's better that kids have a positive experience in an academically oriented community environment than be out on the streets, getting into trouble, etc. and putting younger children around books is always a great thing.**

plus, they have a quiet study room for pin-drop silence people like me!",8

"update i 31m found torn-up remnants of a plan b box in the kitchen garbage. my wife 27f should have no reason to use emergency contraceptive because i had a vasectomy years ago. i talked to her.. i would like to preface this post with an apology. i know it has been nearly three weeks since i last posted. to be honest, in no world did i ever imagine people would continue to show so much interest in my situation. i've been online long enough to know that a few weeks here is like an eternity in the real world. not to make excuses, but since my life just fell into the gutter, rolled into a drainage grate, took a trip through the sewer system, and then got eaten by that random ass giant spider from the original it, i have legitimately not had the time or the heart to update you. for that, i am sorry.

for the people who are legitimately concerned about me, thank you. it is encouraging to know that thousands of people are thinking about me.

for the people who wanted to see my situation go about as bad as possible and play out like a greek tragedy, i apologize that it is probably not nearly as interesting as you are hoping for. 

now to start where things left off.

after making my original post, i combed through all of the comments to find reasons as to why she might have torn up a plan b box and thrown it into the garbage. a lot of them made sense. my greatest hope was that it might have just been old. maybe it was before we even met. clinging to that, i hand wrote a flow chart of all of the routes our conversation might take. i'm awful with confrontation and considered every possibility before bringing it up, what i would say in response, and what i would do. i memorized them all.

on the evening after i made my original post, i called her into the living room when she got home from the gym. as i had practiced, i asked her the following question:

>hey, i'm not accusing you of anything, but could you tell me why there was a torn up plan b box in the garbage? 

the second the words ""plan b"" left my mouth, she immediately looked like she had been punched in the stomach. she was completely lost for words. i already knew at that point. i retained eye contact and repeated my question.

>why was there a torn up plan b box in the garbage? you know i had a vasectomy. 

she just mouth breathed, looking at me horrified. then she looked to the floor. then she started weakly sobbing. 

this was not on the flowchart. i had no idea how to respond. i thought if i let her cry it out a bit she might give me a real answer, but she just kept sobbing. finally i prompted her with another question:

>are you crying because you did something you regret?

she shook her head violently. i was so concerned because i thought something horrendous might have happened.

she abruptly shrieked ""i'm crying because my fucking husband doesn't even trust me."" i have literally never seen a person that angry, let alone my wife.

so i prompted her again. 

>just tell me why it was there. you don't have to hide anything from me.

she yelled at me again. repeatedly. ""if you don't trust me, this marriage is hopeless."" ""fuck you for not trusting me.""

this line of questioning repeated itself until she told me to get out of the house. i refused and said that until she was upfront with me about why the box was there, i wasn't budging an inch. she then informed me that either i had to leave or she would leave. since i doubted she had anywhere to stay (her parents don't live anywhere near us), i agreed to go to let us cool down and have a rational conversation like adults later. i went to my best friend's house, the guy who was best man at my wedding, and we got drunk and talked about everything but her.

the following night, i texted her asking if she was ready to talk. she was not. instead, she gave me an ultimatum: i had to 1 apologize, 2 promise to never bring it up again, and 3 learn to trust her completely. only then would she allow me back home. if i couldn't do all three of the above, she was done with me.

i have not returned home and we have now been no contact for over two weeks. i am wearing out my welcome at my best friend's house, who has been nothing short of amazing. i currently have a consultation with a lawyer arranged this afternoon. the lawyer will probably tell me i'm an idiot for leaving the house, and she'll probably be right, but the idea of ever stepping foot in that house again makes me sick to my stomach.

there is legitimately nothing my wife could say to salvage this marriage. i am entirely numb to her, what she's doing, who she's with, or anything else even tangentially related to her. none of my family members know what happened and as far as they're concerned we're still the happy newlyweds. i'm holding off on saying anything until i'm calm and rational and won't do something i'll regret in the future.

**tl;dr** yes, she cheated, yes, the marriage is over, and yes, i feel awful about it. ",7

"for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?. i have waited tables for the last three years.

during my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. they were a pleasure to have as customers. they ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

when i was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, i walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. when i rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. i figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. they ordered their entrees and i went off to handle other tables.

about five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. at this point i started getting concerned, but i took the order and cheerfully said i'd be right back. this time, i went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. he was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, i told him to just trust me. 

a few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and mrs. pregnant woman was also getting into it. i figured that since she didn't notice, things were ok. the problem came when i took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. when mrs. pregnant woman got to the counter, i saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). my bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

it was too late for me to edit them back, so i just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. they all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. they were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an uber.

several minutes later mrs. pregnant woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. i fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. she blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. i said no, but told her that i assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. it was a lame lie and i'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. i did so. then she talked to my manager. my manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

i stood my ground and told her that i'm not going to be responsible for fas. she told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. she also informed me that i could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

but when i talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. the entire staff at the restaurant is against me and i think that i'm going to call in and tell my manager that i quit, but i still feel in the right here. i would like some perspective on this and if i'm the asshole here.",3

"my daughter left daycare and ran into the street and nobody noticed until a stranger found her. (wi) just started work for the first time since having my daughter two years ago. 

left her at a daycare with a group size of 11 and 3 care providers. 

on the second day i was driving and saw her walking down the street several blocks from the daycare with a woman i had never seen before in my life. 

i jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she'd found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (i have no reason to doubt the woman's intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

i drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

i was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a good samaritan that i just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her. 

this occurred on friday and i have yet to receive a response. i would like to know if i can take legal action against them for endangering  my daughter and if i can alert the other parents as to what occurred so they can keep their little ones safe, without opening myself up to slander charges. thanks.

"my mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600v. the doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. it put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.. location: us. original incident happened in indiana.

i should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point i doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

when i was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. she thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. this led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. it turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

it could be some form of ptsd i suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. she told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

"(update) neighbors child has disabilities and won't stop climbing the fence, entering my house and ""freeing"" my dogs. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b93dx3/neighbors_child_has_disabilities_and_wont_stop/

i'm sad about this update for the kid, i took the majority of the given advice and called the police non-emergency number and asked for an officer to come out because i had questions about an issue i'm having and briefly explained it.

officer shows up, i invite him in and explain the whole situation. he isn't really sure what to do about it right now so he asked for a supervisor come to his position. supervisor shows up and i go over the whole thing again, we go upstairs to my computer where i have all the videos clipped and saved (9 times of her entering the backyard and 4 of her entering the house through the garage). 

we watched each one and he gets on his cellphone and goes back to his car. a few minutes later he comes back with 3 flash drives and asks me to copy the videos over to the drive and had me fill out a piece of paper stating what i put on the drive and then signed it, i repeated it all 3 times.

about 45 minutes later after we have been talking and he's been on and off his cellphone the entire time, 2 cps workers show up and review the videos again and take a complete statement from me going back to the first time it happened. this took about two hours because they wanted it to be precise and as accurate as i remember it and left out anything i wasn't 100% sure on.

the officers and cps workers head next door to talk to the parents, parents apparently shut the door in their faces and said they didn't want to talk but because of my statement and the videos of her climbing over, getting stuck, having to be carried back over the times i'm at work or gone and just entering the house they had probable cause to enter the home anyways.

after they were inside their house for about 10-15 minutes another cop car shows up followed by another a few minutes later. i'm in my garage so i don't know exactly what happened inside but after more officers showed up the father was put in the back of a car and the daughter was put into the cps workers van and they left. the father was driven away about 10 minutes after that, then about an hour later the mother is also put into the back of a car and they drive away.

i talked to the initial officer that showed up and asked for a supervisor and he tells me they found drugs (pills not in prescription bottles/not their prescriptions) and that the home was just not being taken care of inside and definitely not a safe environment for a child. said they found drugs not secured and in areas the child had access to them.

i haven't seen them since the day after the post, i feel bad for the kid being in that situation and me being a neighbor not even knowing and my not wanting to call the cops (i didn't think it was anything like they found, i just figured it is really tough raising a kid and add on top of that severe mental disabilities and it's even tougher). i should have called them earlier once the cps reports i was doing over the phone didn't ever do anything.",2

"co my ex lied about vaccinating our immune compromised 8 year old daughter. she now has chicken pox and is in the hospital. i want my ex as far way from my daughter as possible.. me and my ex split up before our daughters birth. there were a variety of reasons for this that i wont get into here. one of them though was her anti-science beliefs. she's an anti-vaxxer and and doesn't trust science or medicine at all. well, this sucks because our daughter was born premature and  immunocompromised. 

&#x200b;

we have have 50/50 custody of her but due to her condition and my wife's anti science beliefs we argue constantly on how to handle her. well, recently our daughter has made incredible progress and last year was given the go ahead to get vaccinated for certain virus's including chicken pox and the flu. my ex went crazy about this and started making my life a living hell. and threatened up and down to take me to court.

&#x200b;

around this time i also got a new job that payed a considerable amount more than my old. when this happened i decided i wanted to move my girl into a private school that has a program for immune compromised children and offered to pay 100% of tuition. the only problem (for her at least) is that this school requires students to be fully vaccinated, up to their medically allowed limit in my daughters case. my ex fought me up and down on this and we ended up in court. the judge agreed with me and ordered my daughter to be vaccinated. 

&#x200b;

ex had a full breakdown but in the end agreed only on the condition she get to take her to ""lessen the emotional damage and make sure the doctor doesn't poison her."" i demanded the medical forms confirming this and she agreed. so, my daughter finally got vaccinated and last fall started at her awesome new school. well, last week my daughter got incredibly sick and had to be rushed to the hospital from school. she somehow had contracted varicella (chicken pox) despite being vaccinated for it. i have been stressed out from the minute i got the call and confused as all hell how she got it. my daughter must have picked up on this and thought i was mad at her because when i was visiting her in the hospital she decided to tell me the ""secret mommy promised to make her keep"".

&#x200b;

turns out my ex didn't vaccinate her. she made my daughter lie about it. instead she has been using ""special oils and salts to keep her from getting sick."" what about the forms i got saying she was vaccinate? there fake. i called the doctor and it turns out she never went in and he never signed any forms confirming she was vaccinated. so my ex lied and faked forms to convince me she was vaccinated.

&#x200b;

i'm pissed to say the least. my daughter is in the hospital because my ex decided to let her beliefs come before our child health. my ex doesn't know i know yet and i told my daughter not to tell her, i want her gone now. how do i approach this to make sue my ex suffers for this. i have the forms she handed me and texts from the day she took her. i also have the doctor on record saying he never signed off on these and that the ones i have a forged. i'm planning on speaking to a lawyer but i would like to know going in what to do. thank you.",2

i phoned my daughter and she said she doesn't want him back. she said some very nasty things. i honestly thought i raised her better than to act in such a manner. but my grandson doesn't want to go back home, i'm perfectly happy to take on the role of legal guardian because the poor child deserves a home in which he's loved, but i want to know what is my best means of making this process as quick and concrete as possible.

"my little cousin cracked my iphone xs max screen. made my aunt pay $329 knowing i have apple care and it only cost me $29. my little cousins are the biggest shits in the world and my aunt pretty much let's them do whatever they want without consequence.

they were roughhousing and knocked my phone off the counter, shattering the screen. 

my closest apple store is about 2 hours away and it's a huge inconvenience for me to drive there not to mention the extra gas. so instead of explaining this to her (she's the kind of person who doesn't care about things that don't effect her directly) i told her it was $329 to fix (which is true if i didn't have apple care). she wrote me a check for $329 and i only had to pay $29 and i pocketed the extra $300. i consider that my non disclosed inconvenience fee.

"after my bike was locked by campus police for being illegally parked, i damaged property to get my bike free and get out of a ticket. when i was in college, i illegally parked my bike onto a sign post. i did this because all the bike slots were overflowing everyday and there just wan't enough parking for all the students. so i locked it to a nearby sign post. i can't remember what it said, probably 'no parking' lol. anyways, i locked it, went to class, and when i came out it had a lock on it from the campus police along with a ticket. it was one of those heavy duty u-shaped metal bar locks. i walked home that day, then later at night when nobody was around, i went back to my bike, worked the sign post out of the ground, which was compact crushed stone, and got my bike free. the lock was still on my frame, but i could ride it. i lay the sign on the ground, rode back home, then the next day i borrowed a stone wheel attachment for a drill and cut through the lock. it wore down the attachment, but i got out of a $15 ticket. yes, i was an asshole, but i was determined not to not let the 'man' win.",11
"me (m34) and fiancee (f27), i am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an ""open"" relationship.. alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as i'm doing it. as it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. i'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (i only found  out because one of her friend's bf contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). i confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. i'll be totally honest in saying that i'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. i manned up, moved on and proposed (which i had planned on doing anyway). this is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200b;

fast forward to recent time. we are due married in november (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. distant, not herself, away with the fairies. even stopped having sex, which was very strange. i put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. forward to christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. i confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. i was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200b;

however, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. i arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. the vibe was bad guys, i could tell. we sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. at this rate i was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. basically, a few of her friends had back in october (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. i'll be honest, the idea made me ill. i said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........i got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. i wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. we got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. i basically said that i needed some headspace, and that i'd spend the weekend at my mates. it was quick after that, and i left without a fuss. i'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. i am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. i suppose if anyone has been in a similar place i could do with some advice

"i'm purposely trying not to get my wife pregnant.. i'm in my later 20's. my wife is still in her early 20's. we currently have no kids, two dogs and have been married for only 7 months. my initial plan was to be married for two years and get established in our jobs, which are fairly new, then start trying for kids. i really do want them and i've expressed my concern to her, but she doesn't want to hear any of it. this person got pregnant, this person is due anytime, her friends from high school/college are having kids, etc. she wants a baby.

we dated for a total of three years before we got married. the first two were a sex filled romp. my wife is a freak in bed and she sure showed it. after we got engaged, it slowed down a bit and she wasn't as freaky, but it was still satisfying. now that we're married, she doesn't want anything intimate unless we are trying. if i say, ""hey, wanna have sex"", or even attempt foreplay, she brushes me off...but...if i say, ""hey, let's make a baby!"" she turns back into freak mode.

my wife is one of those that thought if a guy ejaculates inside a woman, she will become pregnant no matter what. she didn't realize about ovulation and peak times and whatnot. so, after she learned about it, she asked me to download the *flo* app and chart her cycles for her. i did, but manipulated the whole thing. when she thinks she's ovulating, she's not and the chances of her getting pregnant are slim to none. 

sometimes i'll tell her that her ""peak"" day(highest chance of getting pregnant) is coming up in a few days so we should start early. we have crazy sex for 3-4 days in a row and then nothing while she's actually ovulating. 

i'm a bad person. i will eventually give her a baby. just not anytime soon.",11

"for telling my gf's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?. me and diomara (12f) have had a rough summer.  she's been more defiant than usual.  i've been dating her mom mara (30f) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, maple (33m).  both dio and mara have an on again/off again relationship with dio's dad (dynasis).  he's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into dio's life.   typical shitty-ass part time dad.  i've tried to fill the dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200b;

this summer dynasis decides he wants to be a real dad and takes dio in for a month.  good for him, not my business, and mara agrees.  when dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  really mean to me, very dismissive.  a few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  security took her in then called mara, who didn't answer, then called dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  i answered.  they told me i had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200b;

i didn't say anything to her while i picked her up.  i apologized to security, apologized to the store.  i even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  i assured them dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200b;

i'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  not yelling, but in a fatherly tone, i suppose.  i'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how i dont fuck with thieves, and how i absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so i don't appreciate any of this nor will i accept it in my house.  she snaps back that i'm not her dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  from now on, if i wanna tell her something i need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200b;

that killed my soul.  for the past year or so, i've treated her as my own daughter.  i've paid for their housing, i've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  her bio dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  the fuckin check bounced so i had to call him up and he brought cash over.  i told mara about all of this.  she was appalled at what dio said, but she never made dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her dad.""

a couple of days later dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  i say go ask your dad.  she scoffs and says her dad doesn't have the money for it, so i have to pay for it.  i tell her...i'm not her dad so don't ever tell me what i have to pay for.  she cried to mara, who tells me i'm not being an adult about the situation.  mind you, i never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  mara says dio is a kid and i need to stop acting like a kid too.",3
"by swiping on my girlfriend's phone nsfw. so this happened a few days ago and i'm still not sure i'm 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.

i've been with my girlfriend for about a year and i already know she is the love of my life. she's perfect for me. we're perfect for eachother. we're getting ready to move in with eachother and i want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.

we went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. 

she went to the bathroom while i had her phone, and as i was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. if you have an iphone you know what i'm talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you're back at the start of the photo album. it's annoying as hell.

but some photos caught my eye. some photos that i really shouldn't be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.

there she is, the love of my life, trying to get her mouth around the biggest dick i've ever seen in my life. i've watched porn - a lot. i've never seen a dick like this. i'm talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. longer and thicker. as far as i could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.

i could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.

i closed the pictures and i've acted like nothing has happened, but i cannot get these images out of my mind. i've never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats i'm significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.

we haven't had sex since. i can't concentrate on my work. i just wish i had never seen those damn pictures.

"can you legally steal your own property hours after a police officer hands it to the thief?. yesterday my phone was stolen at lunch and i chased down the girl who stole it making a scene in the mall. a plano police officer overheard the commotion and came over.

the girl tried to say i was trying to steal her phone. i told the officer that i could unlock the phone and the girl could not, i told him my pictures are on the phone, my bank information was on the phone, and basically my entire life was there to prove it was mine. 

he refused to give me the chance or believe me. he told me to back off and leave her alone or he would arrest me. 

i left. 

the girl was wearing a uniform of one of the shops in the mall so i decided to check back 2 hours later. i saw her set my phone down by the cash register of her work after failing again to break into my phone. 

when no one was in her store and her back was turned i took my phone back. 

before anyone starts going off on me for it, i know. i know exactly what i did was extremely stupid but i am still paying for that phone so...yeah. 

i am asking for the legalities of it.

the phone was set on a counter and not in an area that would be considered employee only, the store was open, and the phone is legally mine. 

the place is obviously heavily video monitored so there is no doubt that i am on video. my questions are simply did i break any laws?

if the phone was on the counter, not behind the register but on the counter, the store was open and i was not asked to leave, and the phone is legally my property did i break the law?

"my daughter (7) keeps getting touched inappropriately at school, school brushing it off (washington). on a near daily basis, my daughter (age 7) is getting groped by a boy at school.  she says he typically does it when the class is lining up and when the teacher is not looking, or at recess.  so far he has touched her butt, her chest, and proclaimed ""we should have sex.""

we talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  this has not helped.  we escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

the principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  the read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  the principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

we are really fed up that the situation is allowed to keep occurring and that our daughter does not feel safe.  it shouldn't be up to my daughter to ""cause a scene"" when it happens.  what obligation (if any) does the school have to try and correct this issue?",2

"alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn't have the social acceptance it does.. alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven't done many drugs. it slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. in high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance i've ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

there is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don't seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

i really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify i don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly.

jack celebrated his birthday in september, and as many of you suggested, i told him that i'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. that way it didn't look like kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy kim's gift. 

kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that i was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. it's flattering to read that so many of you think that joe and i are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with kim. it was humbling for kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

for those who are asking, i didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because i wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone i know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. but since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, i bought jack a horse. my family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem.

"by missing every sign on a date. so didn't happen today, but rather yesterday. i invited a close friend to the movies with me. a few odd things happened, and it wasn't until i spoke to a friend of mine that i realized i missed multiple hints that she was into me. 

1) beforehand, i jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and i got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). she replies ""don't worry, if that were you and i, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. i laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. i replied, ""i guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. she then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in my car though"". i then replied ""you know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

3) when we get back to her house, she asks if i want to go inside to get a soda, to which i politely declined because i wasn't thirsty.

tldr: i missed strong signs that she was dtf


edit: there is an upside to this however: she's very eager to go to the movies again.

"never look at monthly payments. negotiate on the final price.. this happens everywhere i go.
car dealership, ""so what do you want your monthly payment to be?""
insurance agent, ""great so your downpayment is $xx and your quarterly payments are $xx""
etc..

um, i want to know what the final out the door price would be?

""well tell me what you can afford and i'll see if we can make this work for you. so how much are you looking to pay a month?""

why is this bad? because you cannot compare apples to apples with just a monthly payment. sure they can make your monthly payment super low and just extend your term to forever so they make more money. or for insurance purposes you cannot compare that policy vs another one.

also you should know the true cost of the items you are buying. sure those $150 airpods at 5 bucks a month on your credit card is easy to afford. but once you factor in that 22% interest rate over how long it takes to pay it off were they really worth the $180+ you just paid?

i feel like majority of uninformed consumers should be considering the true cost of items vs they i can afford that monthly payment mindset. no wonder people live paycheck to paycheck thinking they cannot afford to have an emergency savings because all of their money is going towards those monthly payments.

wait emergency savings? i don't need that, i have available credit on my credit cards!",10

i see a lot of posts here about pensions vs 401ks, or people who say ""i'm not worried because i've got a great pension plan"", or something to that effect.

well, this is a stark reminder that pensions are not bulletproof.  yes, all investing is some form of gambling, but with 401ks and iras it's at least your money, which you control and can withdraw as needed.  i am *not* saying that pensions are inherently bad and that no one should ever use one.  they are a great cushion to your other assets.  but please, please, please: do not skip other forms of investing because you think you're going to be set for life in retirement thanks to a company pension plan.",10
"i stole over $20,000 in a very creative way in the 90's. i worked at a fast food chain in the 90's when i was in high school. when i worked there they were in the process of phasing out denominational gift certificates. ($5, $10 & $25) 
the way is worked was if you spent more than half of the certificate they gave you the cash back. so if you ordered $5.50 worth of food and gave them one of the $10 gift cards, they gave you the $4.50 back in cash. my manager was in charge of destroying all the existing certificates as we transitioned to the more traditional credit card looking gift cards. 

so my manager said he shredded the certificates like he was supposed to, but one night when i was closing i found two boxes of the gift cards tucked deep in the dry storage room. they were filled with the certificates that were supposed to be shredded. so, i scooped them up, brought them out to the dumpster in trash bags and threw them away. after we closed, i came back and recovered the back, and brought the certificates home. i counted them. there were 1,000 $25, 1,000 $10, and 500 $5 certificates. none of them had expiration dates. total haul was $40k in fast food certificates. 
my manager never said a word, he couldn't. he had reported them destroyed weeks earlier. 

over the next three years my girlfriend and i toured every location in our state, and the next 4 states ordering food, and getting the change. we never kept track on a spreadsheet or anything, but we got good at knowing what menu items were just about half. 

after the first year, we started saving the change in a shoe box, and let it build up. 

i bought my first car for $7,800 cash from the change.
and for some reason a kiddie cone was $1.05, if you gave them a $5 cert they gave you $3.95 back. we threw away a lot of kiddie cones. 

edit:

holy crap this blew up.  here are the answers to some of the faqs

1. we could hit 10-12 stores in a day if we drove around for 5-6 hours.  both of us would use a gift cert.  it was not that labor intensive.  


2. the only cameras in the store were at the cash registers & take out window.  


3. the manager has no clue who took them, or at least never treated my differently.  


4. each gift certificate had a generic plu on them.  e.i. all the $25 were plu #756.

5.  when we stopped selling the certificates we were told to keep honoring them because they were pre paid.  they were not coupons.  

6.  one can only eat so many ice cream cones.  ",11

"by scatmanning a girl i was dating. 
so quite recently i've been listening to the song ""scatman"", which for the uninitiated is a dope song of a dude scatting which kinda goes like ""scatdobiddlybiddlygiddlydiddlybiddlydiddly...""  and then he says ""i'm the scatman!"".

so i couldn't get this song out of my head for the past couple days and i was always queuing it up on spotify. 

long story short a girl i've been dating came over last night and my brain didn't override my stupidity when i decided to add scatman to my sexytime playlist. 

when she came over it was pretty much 'prepare for battlestations' from the first minute, so i put the sexytime playlist on shuffle. it started off well with some song from the mezzanine album, and then one i can't remember and then a jazzy one. by this point i was just beginning to go down on her. 

this is where i fucked up. the scatman song came up next after the relaxing jazz and it was so fucking jarring. 

i guess a normal person would've stopped and skipped the song. i really regret not doing that now. 

instead of that, without skipping a fucking beat, i started to use my tongue and went down on her at the same exact pace as the dude in the song was scatting. it was so fast that i had to concentrate hard to get the timing right. i know it probably was bad technique, but i started and i had to commit.  
it was probably 9 seconds of doing that before i stopped and came up. i looked into her eyes and perfectly in time with the song i said ""i'm the scatman"".  

i don't know what expression i expected to see on her, my brain clearly short circuited for me to do that in the first place. what i didn't expect was the look of pure disgust.  

that moment went in pure slow motion for me. my brain pretty much exploded and was like ""ah fuck i can't believe i've done this"" 

i saw no means of recovery so i got up and paused the song. and she said ""can we just hang for a bit instead""  and i agreed. we ended up watching an episode of friends, both of us refusing to acknowledge what just happened. then she said she had to go back to her place.

we've only been dating for 3 weeks and i'm pretty sure i might've totally fucked this up. at least i have a funny story out of it, though i'd much prefer having a girlfriend.

tldr: went down on a girl to the scatman song and now she might turn into a ghost",4

"for three years, i switched my partner's tea in the morning because i couldn't deal with his fake snobbery.. when my ex and i started dating, i used to make him a morning cup of tea as a cute gesture and it stuck for the three years that we were together. it's a nice small thing you can do to make someone's day and and it's a nice way to get to know how someone likes things doing. so, my morning tea used to be any old teabag (yorkshire tea if it was on offer), a splash of milk, and the first cup always had a teaspoon of sugar; every cup after was just tea and milk. my ex however had to have a very specific ritual: thompsons punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. he was adamant that he could tell in a heartbeat when his morning cup of tea and at the age of 33, he's never liked any other tea other than fortnum & mason's royal blend.

so, in the beginning when he would stay at mine, i entertained this notion and used to make his morning tea the way he liked: thompsons punjana tea, a teaspoon of milk and absolutely no sugar. he would always thank me and tell me that i make the best cups of tea and it was nice, three times a week didn't kill me and it was a sweet gesture. fast forward three months when he would spend nearly everyday of the week at mine (but not moved in), he was very demanding of his morning ritual and being a student, i couldn't keep affording to buy that brand of tea; besides, what was wrong with pg tips or any non-branded supermarket tea? tea is tea after all. so, i used to always make his cup of tea with any tea bag, a teaspoon of milk and no sugar. i was always sure to only make it when he was in the shower or still in bed so he could never catch me out and initially, he was dubious and was always asking to make sure it was thompsons punjana tea (he used to call it by it's full name to emphasise how good it was). after a few trials of different teas, i finally found that sweet point where he couldn't taste the difference. i would drink it with him and as he sipped, would go on about how you can taste the quality and that there is really no other tea like it.

when we moved in with each other, it was a lot harder to disguise the fact that i was keeping the same box of tea and just filling it with regular tea bags so i had to be a bit more clever. at the time, i was studying at college so i was in control of weekly food shops and only really wanted to go twice a week to minimise costs so we had more to spend on meals out. i used to buy one bag of his tea and two bags of mine a week and kept them in the drinks cupboard. when it came to making his in the morning, i would take one of his teabags and put it in my pocket, giving him one of mine instead and i used to give my tutors at college his tea to drink during the day. he would always comment that i run out quicker of my tea bags because of the quality and that with punjana, one bag is enough for a considerable amount of time; little did he know. this went on for a couple of years and i never told anyone about it out of fear that he would find out, as after all, he really couldn't tell so why ruin the fun? it was saving me money and it was sort of amusing. i never let him make a cup of tea unless i was away so he never really had to find out. 

after we split up, we remained good friends and i've spent some time with him too in our old flat. every time i visit, he always asks me to make a cup of tea the way i used to for old times sake because everyone he's been with or dated after me can never ""make it taste the way i did"". he even says that when he makes it himself with punjana that he could never make it taste right and that i was some sort of special tea maker. i still haven't told him.

this is a long post about tea so the tldr: ex used to play on that he was very fussy with tea, i switched his morning cup to a considerably cheaper tea bag and he could never tell the difference and still can't.",11

"by falling asleep in the back of my boyfriend's car. last summer. we're on a road trip from new mexico to mexico. we have a honda element converted for living in, so i crawl in the back to nap while he's driving. he stops at a gas station in the desert of arizona and while he's pumping, i get out to use the bathroom. come back out, don't see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. i jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. i sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. i reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.

i go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don't have one. obviously they do, but whatever. so i start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we're in the middle of nowhere and they think i'll steal it i guess. i go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. i realize i don't know my boyfriends number by heart so i just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he'll answer. he doesn't. i use one person's phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend's number, but alas, his phone is dead when i call.

i resort to explaining to everyone whose phone i ask to use my situation. some don't believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and i was just being modest. it's been about 2 hours now. the store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, i'm still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.

a cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. i explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. she tells me i can't stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. i ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. we're driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he's at the gas station and there's a guy there looking for his girlfriend. i just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. and there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn't believe he'd actually done that. 

he said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized i wasn't in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he's ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. and that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. he thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. 

edit: i understand ifu by not relaying my need to pee.
also that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. also have never heard of this last man on earth episode until now, so that's pretty funny. i have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened irl.

anyway the consensus with my rl friends was i needed to tell her. we do brunch on saturdays because she does yoga sundays so we met up this morning. 

i could barely eat and she could tell something was up. she got worried thinking i was going to say no or something worse so by the time we took a walk both of us were nervous wrecks. 

i sat her down and told her everything how i realized i was in love with her several years back but was to much of a chicken shit to come clean. i told her that i never said anything because i did not want to jeopardize our friendship. her face turned white then a myriad of expressions came over her face then she started laughing till tears came down her face. 

i honestly was stunned, my stomach was in my throat and i honestly thought that almost 12 years of friendship were down the toilet.      then she started crying, sobbing really  and she lightly hit my chest. she half laughed and sobbed that she was in love with me too but she thought that it would also impede the friendship we had and she wanted nothing to screw up what we have.

we hugged and i told her that there is no one on this earth i would want to have a child with but her. we talked for hours ,in fact i just got home. we have decided that we want to focus on us for now. i want us to be at that point that we can do it together. 

i know that this isn't a rom com, and that things could end up not working out  for us in the end.

i've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what i made on day-care.

so in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""good luck with the mortgage and bills, i've taken my money out of our bank account and turned off your card on my credit"". i would say i was shocked, but i really am not. he's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

i obviously need an attorney, i logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. what resources can i begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until i can find childcare and a job? is there anything i can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? i understand it's all ""his"" money but we are married with a child. i don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.

i wrote up a long ass apology letter that i wanted to read to my brother. i waited until he got home and got into bed for the night.

i knocked on his door and he was so fucking excited that it was me. i couldn't even get through the first few words. i started crying after saying ""i wanted to say i'm really sorry"" and just couldn't get through it.

i just got into bed with him and laid down next to him. he hugged me really tight and said ""i missed you buddy"".

i fucking lost it. i never cried that bad before. he just hugged me for a long time until i calmed down. we didn't talk much. he started crying for a bit too. it was the first time in a long time we just hugged. after half an hour i got up and gave him a kiss and he told me he was so happy. why didn't i do this earlier, fuck.

i thought i could i try apologizing properly again tomorrow. i left him the note to read anyway.

i am feeling very hopeful right now and a lot of pressure in my heart is gone. i swear to god and on my own life i will never treat my brother so badly again.

i have been working part-time for the past year and i was saving some money so my brother and my mom could go on a trip to a place he really wanted to go to. but i think i will take my brother myself instead (when i turn 18).

i also realized that i need to have a relationship with my brother where i am not just taking care of him. it needs to be like a normal brother relationship. like going for movies and stuff. it's going to take some time for me to fix the mess i created though. i'm just lucky my brother is amazing.

my actual post:

remorse


i know this will get a lot of hate and yes i deserve it. i am not looking for any validation or forgiveness. i know i am a piece of human trash.

i just need to get this out.

i have a brother who is two years older then me. he has suffered from a condition since birth that forces him to be in a wheelchair anytime he is out of bed. he cannot use his arms that well either.

we used to have a great relationship until i turned 11 and i really started resenting the amount of attention he took from my parents. and how much stress he put them under.

i had to constantly help him, change him, feed him. i hated it.

there was a few years in his life when he so mean to my parents and it really made me resent him more.

i realize now that i had no right to judge him and i will never know how difficult life is for him.

i stopped hanging out with him and made more friends at school. i would tell my family all the fun i was having at school during dinner to make him feel bad.

i started barely talking to him or acknowledge his presence. he would get frustrated to the point of tears to get my attention.

it started escalating two years ago when i would purposely turn off the wifi and unplug the tv every time we had to leave the house so my brother could do nothing but sit in his wheelchair.

i would purposely delete his favorite saved shows on the dvr. i would make fun of his speech. push things just out of his reach.

i would act disgusted when i had to change or bathe him. it always made him feel bad and he would apologize. i made my own brother apologize for taking a dump. what the fuck is wrong with me?

but my fucking saint of a brother never told my parents. and he never let me have it.

three weeks ago, he was trying to talk to me non-stop and i was just ignoring him. i got annoyed and wheeled him against his wishes to the backyard and placed him under an umbrella and went back inside. i fell asleep and realized i left him out there for three hours.

when i went to bring him back inside he was in tears and wouldn't look at me. he was humiliated. 

i have always felt guilty about how i treated my brother all these years but my anger towards him overpowered it. but seeing that look on his face affected me in a way that was different from before.

i stopped all the bullying after that day. i couldn't even look him in the face i was so ashamed.

last sunday my brother told me he was glad i was his brother and friend. i couldn't even respond. i went to my room and cried.

i'm fucking crying again typing this all out. when did i become an evil trash human being? fuck.

i'm 17 and he's 19 now. i know there is nothing i can do to make up for the past 6 years.

my brother will be returning with my mom from a specialist appointment tonight. i'm going to apologize to him and beg for his forgiveness tonight. i want to start being being a fucking decent brother to him again.

i am a healthy guy with no issues who chose to bully his only brother for something that wasn't even his fault. i am so ashamed of myself.",11

i guess i can shut down some of the disagreement by saying that every field does things a little bit differently, but this is what's worked for me as a soon-to-be college grad, with little truly significant work experience, and wanting to go into education. most american employers/career help centers i've met with suggest keeping it to about a page because employers won't go over every resume with a fine-toothed comb right away. anything you find interesting but maybe less important could be brought up in an interview as an aside, perhaps. 

a few people have mentioned latex. i use latex often in my math coursework, but i'm not comfortable enough with it outside of mathematical usage for a resume. pages (on mac) has been sufficient for me.

"to all the graduating high school seniors and those turning 18 - get a bank account that's only in your name.. for minors, it's generally required for a parent to co-sign their bank accounts.  once you turn 18, it's best to establish an account in your name only, so you have sole control of it.  it would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bank/credit union than the one the minor account was in, to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account.

there are a couple reasons for this.  it doesn't take too long to find stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control.  the parents could have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe.  there could be disagreements between parents and their kids, so they take the money away as a punishment.  or, it could just be old fashioned greed and the parents decide to just take the money.  it doesn't matter who earned the money that's in the account.  if two people are on it, the money belongs to both parties and the bank isn't going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash.

keep in mind also, having your own account does not mean that your parents can't send you money if you need it.  all they need is your account and routing number (the same information that would be on a check) to deposit money into the account.  in addition, there are any number of banking apps today they could use to send money to you if you're still being supported by them.  other excuses may have good intentions at heart, but from a safety and security standpoint, it's best to establish an independent banking account.",10

"(update) nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a2bj15/nsw_australia_last_month_a_friend_began_to_cross/)

i went to a lawyer my parents had used a few years ago and they recommended. she took one look at the letter from my friend aaron's lawyers and said she has concerns about it, and she'd respond. 

she contacted his lawyer, and my lawyer mailed me to tell me aaron's lawyers aren't his lawyers at all, but to contact her if i heard more otherwise no need for more action.

aaron had apparently faked up the letter and admitted as much to me yesterday when he finally decided to talk to me. he wants me to retract my complaint to his lawyers about him using their letterhead. i hadn't complained to them myself so i did the time honoured thing and told him to go pound sand, but it might have rhymed with 'go eat a bag of dicks'.

"update - dog ate neighbor's drone. *edit: original(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5oa42v/dog_ate_my_neighbors_drone_am_i_liable_il/) *

a small update to my neighbor flying his drone in my backyard and attacking my dog:

i was served a summons by a sheriff's deputy, neighbor decided to take me to small claims over his drone. my mil is a paralegal secretary, so i was able to get a free consultation with a lawyer where she works to ask some questions about what to bring and how to prepare. he seemed genuinely amused that my neighbor was even trying to sue. he also suggested i counter sue and how i could possibly add in more damages. 

he also told me that my neighbor and i technically live within 5 miles of an airport, and even though it doesn't have a tower technically that falls under faa regulations. i called the hotline from google and spoke to them about my neighbor's hobby of flying out of line of sight, flying several thousand feet in the air, flying near an airport and made an inquiry into if he was registered to fly drones, saying he owned two very large drones (he already bought a new one, this one is almost 5' across). i don't know the weight of his, but it definitely is at least a few pounds. they took my information and have called me back once, so i know they're investigating but don't know anything else. not sure if they'll tell me anything anyways.

i brought both police reports to court, as well as several photos of my backyard, photos of our shared 8' high privacy fence, medical bills for my  dog, and a few short videos i had of him doing fly bys over my dog in the past. his main argument to the judge was that i ""maliciously installed a table to allow my dog to jump high enough to catch his drone, which i (somehow) trained him to do"". which, yes i had recently bought a new picnic table, but only so i have somewhere to sit and eat outside. i argued that his flying was causing my dog anxiety and that's what provoked it, and thanks to y'alls advice, that my dog could have potentially died from ingesting part of the drone or if the drone hit him. in the end, he now has to pay me just under $2,000 for various vet bills (xrays, dental exams, sedation, medication etc). he is also banned from flying over my property, and i installed trail cams front and back yards just in case. he seems pretty upset with me, so i wanted to be careful. 

the only thing that could make this better is if the faa finds a reason to fine him or take away his drones.",2

i managed to get with a beautiful girl named marcy when i first started getting into the thick of things. she knew who i was but she said she loved me. 

i will regret this for the rest of my life, but i was the person who shot up marcy for the first time. after that, there was no stopping her. she stuck around with me, probably because i was her dealer more than anything, but then i got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

a year ago she reached out to me on facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn't hate me for what happened and she hoped i was still clean.

"by eating the ends off a chicken wing.. yesterday i ate the ends of a chicken wing. someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so i tried it out. i never expected this to happen. 

i must not have chewed one properly. i got something lodged in my throat. to dislodge it i ate some bread and drank some softdrink. some pain persisted but i went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. 

this morning i woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. i walked to the public hospital down the road because i was starting to worry. 

the gp noticed i had a ""crunchy throat"" when pressing on it. he immediately sent me off to get an xray. that showed i have a perforated esophagus. that is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. the ""crunchy"" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. 

to get more information i started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3219576/

they consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. it's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. a few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. they said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. 

now i'm waiting on the results of the ct scan which will determine whether i get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. if i'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. 

tl;dr: i ate the ends off a chicken wing and now i'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.

**update:** a surgeon just spoke to me. i have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. they don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.

**update 2:** the main surgeon just spoke to me. i'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. the critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. so i can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and i need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.

"i slept with my daughters ex boyfriend, he got me pregnant and i had an abortion. they got back together and got married.. this was back in... let me think, maybe 1997? i was 38 and my daughter was 18, and she was dating harry, who was 24. i was an alcoholic and dabbled in other drugs, mostly cocaine. i was not a good person, let alone mother. not like i was abusive to my daughter or anything but i was generally inattentive and cared more about my alcohol and drugs than her, especially in her teen years. i am 14 years sober now. 

i disproved of my daughter dating harry, but i never told her why. he would flirt with me, constantly, and the age difference also creeped me out. also, he was an alcoholic and drug user, just like me. she broke up with him over his alcoholism. 

soon after she moved away, not too far but regardless she didn't live with me anymore. harry kept calling me and asking if we wanted to get drinks, i turned him down, but then one day he said he had a bunch of coke and i couldn't resist. he came over, we did the coke, and we ended up having sex. he was a very good looking guy. he looked a lot like that ridiculous 80s justin beiber picture that was on the front page today, that is actually what made me think about him. 

for the next few months, maybe like 3-4 months, he would sometimes come over and we would have sex and do drugs and get drunk together. any drug addict knows what that is like to have a drug addict buddy in that way. 

then i got pregnant. i knew it was by him, i had sex without a condom a few times stupidly. i never told him i was pregnant, and i went and got the abortion and kept it a secret. 

anyways, i stopped seeing him after that, it was too weird. i also got sober, for like 4 months, before relapsing. fast forward 2 years and my daughter contacts me and tells me that she got back with harry, and that he is fully sober. i was mortified honestly. he was gonna tell her that we slept together, and she is going to hate me for life. they came over one day and said hi, and when my daughter was gone, harry told me that there is no reason to tell her about what happened. i agreed. 

its been 16 years of marriage on their part. they have a kid together. harry got cancer, then beat it. i got sober. that's basically it. 

i don't see them very often, they live in texas and i live on the east coast. but whenever i do there is always that tension between me and harry, its literally the first thing that comes to either of our minds, i can just tell. not like sexual tension, like ""why did we have to do that? what the fuck is wrong with us?"" kind of tension.

"irs will allow employers to match their employees' student loan repayments. https://www.marketwatch.com/story/irs-ruling-allows-401k-student-loan-benefits-2018-08-27

the irs is setting up a framework for companies to match their employees' student loan repayments in the same way companies match 401k contributions. this will be cost neutral for the employer (edit: as in, it would not be more or less expensive for the company than traditional matching).

edit: the employer's match would go into the employee's 401k account.

according to the article, employees with student loan debt accumulate 50% less wealth in their retirement plans (by age 30) than their peers without student loan debt. i think most of us with student debt have at one point or another felt ""behind"".

thoughts? this is definitely a cool idea and would be a great hiring incentive/perk.

edit 2: due to the popularity of this post, i wanted to remind everyone of some of the rules on our sub.

>we don't allow:
 • moralizing issues
 • petitions
 • political discussions
 • political baiting
 • soapboxing

this is meant to be a discussion of personal finance, debt, and retirement savings, not a meta review of the pros and cons of capitalism. please keep things on topic.


edit 3: since a lot of people are confused, i'll explain how a 401k match works. a 401k is a retirement savings plan that came into popularity as pensions fell out of the mainstream. the 401k is a tax-efficient vehicle to invest your money for retirement. like the pension, employers can contribite to their employees' 401k plans as a benefit. this is usually done via a matching mechanism: i contribute 4% of my paycheck, and my employer matches that amount. matches are almost always capped.

with the method laid out in the article, you would be able to make qualified student loan payments and have your company match that amount as a contribution to your 401k, up to a certain amount. so say you make $2000 per month, your employer matches 5% of your 401k contributions, and your monthly minimum loan payment is $1000 (in this example, you have a lot of debt). you aren't contributing to your 401k currently. if your company chose to take advantage of this program, they would put $100 ($2000*0.05 match) in your 401k each month you made a payment on your student loan.

this doesn't ""hurt"" people without loans. this is only subsidized by the government insofaras the 401k is tax-sheltered (you still pay taxes on that money), and this doesn't constitute your company paying your loans. participation isn't compulsory.",10

after my first week and 3 trips to costco i made enough to buy more inventory per trip minimizing my trips to costco and cutting into profits. added variety to what i had(started with coke, then added sprite, then dr pepper). 

at first i was holding in my locker but realize heat was an issue. invested in an insulated bag and had 2-3 frozen waters inside to keep things cool, and added help was chilling the drinks the night before also, i was sold out on average before lunch or at the begining of lunch.

4 months i noticed sales drop and i was leaving school with inventory. found out i had competition of others who not only picked up on what i was doing but started selling flavor variety like cherry coke, fanta, shasta and what not. by this time i had already established myself with faculty and  added diet cokes/diet dr peppers per request, yup, paid then off with free drinks which took a hit on profits weekly but secured me from getting in trouble with most security guards where i made transactions and classes i had and a few trusted teachers from previous semester. on average lost about a 6 pack to 9 sodas weekly, no big. had the principal and a few vice principles buying as well.

needless to say competition wasnt something i needed. had em get pinched by faculty once i found out who it was. out of 6 (including myself) 4 got caught, the other gent i let him continue doing what he was doing because i knew his background and he and his fam needed the money. 

i did get pinched by a substitute in class, was sent to the same vice principle who was a buyer. all i was told was be careful and sat in his office till next class period started.

my end goal was to pay for all senior fees which include cap, gown, diploma, senior night, prom and senior ring. 

by early senior yr i had made enough to cover all fees, including my tux rental and my portion of a limo for prom night.

also bought a ps2 and saved the rest as a base starting point for. used car ( after starting a job and saving for an additional year it ended being a 97 honda accord, so nothin fancy)

end of senior yr i helped 2 jrs continue what i was doing and helped them figure it out and connected them to my faculty buyers.

i have 0 regerts about it all. 

update: holy crap this blew up while i was in class! 

what's gold?! what's silver?! 

thank you to who ever gave them to me...can i buy soda with it!?

i should also clarify this happened back late 02 to early 04. just figured stature of limitations expired and figure some people would enjoy it.

appreciate the love 

answering some questions: 

-yes i'd do it all over again, roughly 1300 in student dues was a burden my parents didnt need on them, not including the 300.00 for tux and limo fees.  i'm glad i didnt have to go sell candy to raise the money in a saturated market in which everyone was doing the same damn sales in the same district.

-yes, i was a snitch, but i felt i was in a position where i had 0 repercussions to face since i was well liked. it was a power move and it worked. 

- the ones caught got a week detention and that was it. 

i'll try and answer any questions i can 😁.",11
"update to: i found out i have a daughter who thinks i was her mother's rapist. it wasn't rape. what next?. ten days ago i requested advice and the post got removed after a day because i didn't use a throwra.  i'm reposting it below, along with an update, since some people asked for one. i alerted the moderators i would be doing this, so hopefully it will allowed.

original

i received an email last week from a woman claiming we are a dna match and she is my biological daughter. it was a long and emotionally charged letter. she said she knew she was child of rape, and while she had no desire to form a relationship with me, she wanted me to know that she existed and to understand the pain and anguish i had caused her and her mother and grandparents. the letter was gut wrenching.

i was shocked but also skeptical. i have been married 25 years and i have three great kids. i have never raped or abused a woman ever! i thought this had to be a prank or scam. i had done home dna ancestry testing two years ago, and it had not shown a child i wasn't aware of. but when i logged into my account, there she was.

i did some sleuthing and figured out that her mother was a woman, terry (fake name), i had dated for about a month during our first semester of college in the mid-1980s.  we broke it off mutually and remained friendly. the very last night of the second semester, we hooked up at a dorm party and went to my room and had sex. it was a casual hookup and i remember it as 100% consensual and very passionate. also unprotected. afterwards we went back to the party and had a great time dancing and mingling with friends. we both went home the next morning for summer break. terry didn't come back to college the next year, which i gave very little thought to since we weren't close and hadn't bothered to communicate all summer. 

one of the reasons terry and i were incompatible was religion. she was catholic and i'm jewish. i was not religious but she had grown up in a strict household. my supposition is that when she discovered the pregnancy, she told her family she had been raped rather than admitting to premarital sex with a jewish ex-boyfriend. but who knows, maybe she had other reasons. 

it kills me that i have a daughter in her 30s who has been fed lies about her father. i can't imagine growing up thinking i was a product of rape. that has to be so hard psychologically. i am in pain for a child i didn't even know existed just a few days ago, and who hates me.

i have been debating what to do. i have not written back to my daughter. i badly want to tell her the truth, in a way that she can believe (but how?). my wife, who has been a rock the last few days, keeps telling me to give this some time and thought. my best friend says i should hire a lawyer. i don't know what to do and it's eating me up. advice, please!

update

i hired a lawyer. he recommended that i respond to my daughter's email to unequivocally deny the rape allegation. i wrote her a short message and described how and when terry and i met. i was careful not to attack terry and to offer sympathy. i explained that our sex was consensual. a week went by with no response.

two days ago my daughter wrote me and said terry now claims she was raped a month after she and i had sex, and that she was told by her doctors that the baby was born premature 8 months later. she's basically saying she was misled by her doctors. i find that very hard to believe, but if it's true it is awful and if it's not i guess it gives terry a way out without exposing her big lie which is maybe best for everyone.

yesterday i spoke to my daughter for the first time. she was crying and so was i, so it wasn't easy to say much. before we hung up, i told her that i loved her because she's my flesh and blood, and i hoped we could get to know each other and meet my grandchild. she sobbed so much after that, and said she's been waiting her whole life to hear those words.

my wife and i told our kids about a week ago. they are teenagers and took it really well. all three are interested in meeting their new sister and niece. my wife....my beautiful, caring, bestest friend ever....she's been nothing but supportive. she has offered that we invite my daughter and granddaughter to visit over the christmas holidays, even suggesting we pay the airfare and offer them our guest room. my daughter is going to call me again tonight and i'm going to propose she come, or offer to fly to her if she's more comfortable. we have a lifetime of catching up to do.

meantime as for terry, i feel like my daughter and i were robbed, but i really don't want to dwell on it. she hasn't reached out to me and i don't plan to either, though i'm prepared to be cordial if she does, and to listen to her story and be open minded.

"doctor's office keeps telling my mom my test results. i'm 22 and no longer even live with her.. background: my mom worked at a very small hospital in a very small town for 30+ years and is close to most of the doctors, nurses, and office workers not only in the hospital but around the whole town as well. my gp who i have seen since i was ~10 years old is one of them my mother is close with. i moved away for college when i was 18 but continued seeing him due to just not wanting to mess with finding a new gp and my mom wanting me to continue seeing him since i've seen him half my life. 

i get routine blood work done to measure how my liver is doing as well as monitor the levels of a certain medication i take to make sure that i'm not getting too little/too much. the results of this information or the fact that i have those tests done isn't a big secret i want to keep, they don't really mean anything unless i were to become sick and they don't test for information like say illicit drugs. 

the first time i had this work done, i hadn't been to that doctor in a while to really remember if this had happened in the past, but they called my mom with my results. they even told her specifics, like what my liver enzymes were and what exact mg/ml the medication level was. again, it's not like to my mother this is anything i want to hide, but it was a little concerning that she got the call and i never received any call about my results. i go in for these monthly, so the next month that i went i told the woman working in the lab of the office that i wanted to update my information to make sure i got the results (i thought also since i had been seeing this doctor since i was 10 i probably had never given them my phone number). a few days later my mother again got the call and called to tell me my results; i again got no call from the office. once again, not a big deal, but since this happened when i explicitly gave my phone number in place of my mother's, i was a little tipped off that i wasn't called again. i chose to wait until my next lab work to say anything again anyway. 

at this visit i had both lab work and an appointment to get a refill on birth control. he asked me to do a pregnancy test in with this blood work due to me running out of said birth control a few days earlier. i wasn't worried that i was pregnant, but i knew that now it was serious time to make them stop calling my mom with my results. i asked the lady drawing my blood to confirm my phone number to see if it even got put in last time. it did, so on my way out i stopped to talk to the women who always work in the office/at the desk and tell them explicitly that i and i alone want to be called for my results - not my mother. they nonchalantly agreed and i asked them to check my phone number on the system they use in the office, and it was there. i happened to be visiting in town during this time and staying with my mom, who, you guessed it, got the phone call right in front of me telling her my results including negative pregnancy test. my mom blew up at me asking why i needed to take a pregnancy test (i didn't think this was a big deal especially since it was negative). that all blew over, but at this point i was pissed that she kept getting this information. 

i ended up getting into it with my mom, telling her that that was a direct breech of hipaa and she knows it after working in a hospital. she laughed it off and said something about the doctor knowing me since i was born, her being friends with the office ladies and the doctor, and the one that hit me the most, ""it's not a big deal - i'm your mom!""

since then, i've been getting my lab work done elsewhere. to no surprise there are no issues. i don't really know what to do here. since i cut ties with that doctor, i no longer have personal problems with this, but i'm sure other people do without even knowing it. i don't have resources really for a lawyer. i might consider it depending on how serious you all think this is. so how serious is it really?

"update: mym25 girlfriend24 of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommatem25. i just heard them through the wall.. it's been about a month since my post, unfortunately the mods deleted it from /r/relationships. i don't know if this one will be allowed but i figured i'd give an update to my situation. 

original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ykrq1/mym25_girlfriend24_of_15_years_broke_up_with_me/

> as the title says, we broke up. it was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. we broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so i can see why it happened.
> 
> this isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any pda while i'm around. i still both consider them friends and i just want them to be happy.
> 
> for the most part, they are quiet at night. if i really listen i can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. except for last night. we went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. i was the dd because i don't really drink. anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. i made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. i then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. as i was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. she thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when i was ready. when i finally got to bed i could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. then it got quiet and then it started.

> i don't know how long it lasted, but it was louder than normal. i've been okay with the break up until now, i'm glad they're happy but last night i fell asleep crying.

> i woke up this morning, made breakfast for everyone and started to clean up.
> 
> feel free to ignore this, i just needed to get this off my chest. i'm sad when i really think about the situation, but that's why i try not to.
> 
> tl;dr: my ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

taking everyone's advice i announced that i was going to be moving out. my now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. i told him yes, but i'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. he decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. it's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. my landlord is xrms(ex-roommate) family friend, after xrm explained the situation i ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

xrm and xgf and a few other friends helped me move in. i had a house warming party and was specifically asked that i not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. xrm and xgf also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. my xgf stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. she said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. she told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. it was great. we've gone out a few times since our first date. 

the past few weeks have been the best in a long time, i never really realized how bad my situation was. obviously everything isn't perfect, and i still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but i'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

tl;dr: i moved out and started dating a new girl. ",7

"by leaving thc chocolate out and sending my mom into orbit on edibles. my cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of thc chocolate for christmas, because he'd mentioned that maaaaaybe he'd want to get high. my parents are 75-year old republicans. that was a big maybe.

&#x200b;

well, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. you put half a candy bar down and yoink, gone when you come back.

&#x200b;

you can guess what happened. my mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\~8-16 doses, depending on one's tolerance) and got so high that she couldn't move or talk. her last words, high as a kite, were ""i think this might be the end?"" before my dad, fearing she'd had a stroke, called an ambulance.

&#x200b;

they took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she'd eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. at which point i assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the redbull orbit jumper.

&#x200b;

anyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. so now she's having a triple bypass tomorrow.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.

obligatory gold edit: thanks all for your well wishes! ! a few things to clear up - mom went into the hospital on saturday. as of now, she's been transferred to a hospital in manhattan where she awaits surgery details. i'm in canada for work, so it's kind of tough not being able to hold my mom's hand, but i'm planning to head back down to ny this weekend to be with her. also....op is not a dude. :)

second update from my dad: mom's surgery may be thursday, with the holidays and all. i decided not to mention that i put the story on the internet.

fp edit - thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. i'm headed back to the states on thursday, the tentative surgery date. will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.

update - mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. all of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.

check out my adorable mom

"overheard my 26m fiance 24f tell her friend on the phone that she ""settled for being with me,"" and that marrying me was her ""last resort."". 

update 2: just did one of the hardest things i've ever had to do. today after breakfast i told her we should ""sit down and talk."" she was hesitant, but i said it was important. we went to the living room and she said to me ""i already know what this is about."" my post apparently made it to the front page, so of course she saw it after scrolling down a bit under ""popular."" of course the water works started happening right away. i told her what she said had deeply hurt me, but obviously she already knew that since she read my post. through her tears, she said ""i was just joking, i wasn't serious."" she then went on saying stuff like ""i love you, i love you."" i told her i can't be in a marriage where my s/o doesn't love me the same way i love them. she tried to tell me that she loved me and that i meant something to her. but it was all bullshit. she said she ""didn't want to lose me."" i told her i don't think this marriage was the right decision. and from there i basically told her it was over. i told her i knew how she really felt about me, and that it was fucked yo she basically played with my emotions. for all those wondering, we have no kids, and i pay fully for the apartment we live in, and i own almost everything we have other then her clothes. i even pay for her car. so after all of this she'll have little to nothing left. before our marriage, we agreed to sign a pre-nup, and at that moment, i've never been so happy with a decision i've made in my life. after that it was a few second of awkward silence, before she said to me ""fuck you."" she started screaming at me, telling me ""you just can't end things like that."" i told her i could do whatever i wanted, and that's when she became very hostile. she screamed at me saying, ""you're the fucking worst relationship i've ever been in. you think i can't find someone again?"" ""do you think you'll ever from someone as good as me? you're a fucking idiot my name."" she grabbed her bag and phone, and said ""i'm leaving!"" before slamming the door behind her. at that moment i felt like i was on one of those dramatic sitcoms you'd find of tv. i sat down on the couch and cried, and i'm still crying as i type this up. it's both happy and sad tears, and i knew it was only time before she cheated on me or left me. she never loved me, it was obvious. our relationship only went one way, and i feel like a complete idiot for not seeing it earlier i live in california, and i'm gonna start the process to annul our marriage. tomorrow, i'm gonna start throwing all of her belongings in to trash bags, cause that's essentially where they belong. (i'm not throwing out her stuff. just using the trash bags as a way to give her back the things she owns.) thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of your kind words and your great advice. all of you gave me the courage to stand up for myself, and i know my life will certainly improve as a result.

edit/update: thanks everyone for the kind words! really has made me feel a lot better! going to be talking to her soon. also, i noticed a lot of people thinking this post is fake, i understand how it could be seen that way, but it isn't. i've been engaged to her for over a year and a half, and just 3 months ago we got married. not really used to calling her my ""wife"" yet. also i used an old alt since she uses reddit. anyways thanks for the advice everyone, it amazes me how people on the internet can care so much about a person they don't even know. i'm going to talk to her today. i will be updating you all soon after.

edit: meant to put wife in the title but now i can't change it.

basically the title. i overheard my wife talking to one of her best friends on the phone while i was passing the bedroom. this friend is in a serious relationship. my wife then said to her, ""sweetie, remember it's your choice. don't settle for just anyone. that's the mistake i made. who knows who else i could of had. my name was my very last resort, and now look where it made me end up."" hearing that honestly broke my heart in two. does she even love me? why am i being treated as a second base? 

am i being dramatic and overreacting? i haven't said anything about it since. i honestly don't know what to do, but hearing her say has really made me upset.",7

i played and listened. there's her voice and a voice of another guy. they were goofing around at the google home device. so yeah. 

i confronted her and barraged her with a lot of messages, she only replied at around 1 am.  she kept on denying she's cheating.

then i laid all the evidences, all the screencaps and even the audio clip recording from the google assistant. 

she finally admitted.

"squatter's rights shouldn't be a thing. imagine going on a vacation and leaving your house locked up and relatively assured of its safety. you have a great time, but come back to find your home trashed and someone living there that the police can't evict.(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dyfi1b/man_broke_into_my_house_and_is_now_claiming/)

or, imagine that you inherit a townhouse from your father and you leave it vacant because you don't want to move or have renters in his old property. only you discover one day that a random family had broken in, changed the locks, and now are impossible to evict.(https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-associations-squatters-20170715-story.html)

squatter's rights are a blight on property ownership. you have to be *proactive* to protect something that you own, something that you paid for or inherited, just because criminals decided you have something they want but can't afford. 

this, in conjunction with other random bullshit like police seizures of money, should be what this country should really fight against. it goes against the very core of american beliefs, which is the right to own property and it is one of the worst laws still on the books.",6

"by stumbling on my 19 y/o sons reddit and reading through it.. dear lord. on my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so i clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  i click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

this is my sons account. it has to be. the comment he posted is about something that happened while i was there. he had a more detailed post about that specific day. he had another previous post about an event in his life i knew about and knew some details about. he had a few other posts which i also read. 

i now know what gets him going sexually. not something i needed to know.

i know what his girlfriend likes sexually. also, not something i needed to know. also quite surprising. 

i know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. i feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

i know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife's room.

in reading through the comments he's made to others, i've learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. i feel very proud about that.

overall, i wish i never clicked that first comment. i know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

tl;dr. accidentally discovered my son on reddit. found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, i shouldn't have read all of it. and some posts i stayed away from. and honestly, i didn't realize it right-right away. the first post i read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. it was after another that i really put the pieces together. and yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. but hey, life isn't always fair. i also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything i read.**",4

"for firing an employee after his parents died?. i'm the vp of sales at a software company and one of our sales development reps parents passed away at the beginning of april, sadly they were involved in a car crash and both lost their lives. now the employee in question in very young 22 year old guy and has been with us for about 10 months now. he's a great employee and we were thinking about promotions in the next \~6 months for him. his job is a high paying one for a new grad, about \~90k with commission and base so we expect a lot from this position. because of the accident we let him take a 1 month paid leave of absence from work and he's returned a few weeks ago and his performance is severely lacking. he's super unmotivated, not cold calling, out reaching to prospects for the last 2-3 weeks enough since he's come back. our whole mgmt team has noticed this and we decided to let him go because we feel like he'd need months and months to be able to produce again and we can't just wait that long.

we called him into a meeting on friday afternoon and gave him the bad news, he was very calm and rude about it. told us to go fuck ourselves and got up and went to his desk grabbed his few things and left. i thought this was very very unprofessional and extremely rude.

i told my boyfriend about all of this and he said myself and my mgmt team are a bunch of asses and pricks with no hearts.

"i kicked a kid in his balls and he had to have one removed.. this happened when i was around 7 or 8 years old. it was my first year in primary school and i had joined the school with some of my friends from the local feeder school in the area. 

one particular boy was a year older than us and was repeating the first year for some reason. he was of german descent, from a very well to do family and a lot bigger than the rest of us. possibly because he was embarrassed at repeating the year he was a bit of a bully. he often picked on me and some of my friends. i'm sure we probably escalated things at times too because i know he was teased for being german. 

so one day, standing outside class i kicked him full whack in the balls. he buckled over but i can't really remember much of what happened afterwards, we probably tucked tail and ran. i can't even say for sure whether he deserved to be kicked at the time or if i just thought i was getting him back for previous behaviour. 

anyway, he missed school for a few days after and i heard some kids saying he was in hospital. soon after that i was called in to speak to a teacher who as far as i remember dressed me down and explained he had gone home and his testicle has swollen up to the size of a tennis ball and it had to be removed. i don't really remember getting into much trouble about it but i do remember some of the other kids going on about it in banter. 

the details are hazy but i felt so bad and i felt i was in so much trouble that i never ever told my parents about it. this was made worse as my dad and his dad had gone to school together, only found this out after seeing my dad chatting to his dad at a rugby match that me and the kid were playing one saturday about a year after. i was freaking out the whole time they were speaking and then started feeling guilty that my dad might have been seen as rude by his dad for not apologising for my action. it didn't come across that way, as they seemed like old friends catching up but i felt so guilty. 

i felt so awful about it, i mean at the time i didn't realise that it may have an affect on him being able to have children but i felt like i'd done something so horrible and always expected my family to confront me about it. when i learnt of the reproductive challenge this might cause the guilt was just amplified. 

the years that followed in primary school were mostly fine, on the odd occasion he would have a go at me, i remember him having a slightly shorter fuse with me than others but i think he ended up being ok and less of a bully. saying that, he did try drown me in a river at our primary school leavers camp as i'd pissed him off for some reason but mostly the in-between years went by without incident. 

i left that school to go to a different high school so i never maintained contact with him. i saw him once during my teenage years and we chatted for about 5 minutes. i remember it being friendly. i never, ever mentioned it. 

i hope he was able to have children. i'm sorry bro. i'm sorry i never said sorry too.",11

"during my first surgery as a 3rd year medical student. 
i'm a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship ""assisting"" on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. in this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. if you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. as this was my first laparoscopic surgery, i soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. like many of you, i had no idea this role even existed, but i quickly accepted my new job as 'vagina sealer'. i approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. i placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. after several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  the attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said ""do you know where the vagina is? get that stopper out of her ass!""

"deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.. the update!!(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200b;

ohhhhh where do i begin. this happened this weekend.

let's lay out some plot points first..

\-i'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. she is 26.

\-i work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. i've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-i've always worked out, done yoga, i'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. this combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. i've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. i know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, i've done it a lot and i know what i'm doing, lol.

&#x200b;

okay. so, the girl i am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. one of whom is getting married soon. she was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. i was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? i agree to the plan. i was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200b;

there are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. this way, i would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. but the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (i can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200b;

so the day comes, i have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. by the time i arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. i prepare myself with the girl i'm dating, and she invites her friends in. they are hooting and hollaring as i'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. the whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, i'm really into this idea now.

&#x200b;

i throw my legs over my head as i've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... i circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. i put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and i hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. i'm trying to look back to see them, but i'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. i start getting more and more into it, and the girl i'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. at this point i'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. the girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200b;

after a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""cum in your mouth! cum in your mouth!""... now to be clear, i normally don't do this. i have before, lol, but it's not my thing. but i'm the entertainment, and i aim to please, so in my mind i'm thinking lets do this. i start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. the girl i'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. the whole thing is so hot and i feel like i'm about to cum, and.....explode. it was a lot. i'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. the girl i'm dating let's go of my legs and i fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - i'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. so i stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and i look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. my assistant.

&#x200b;

she leaves the room, i race to the bathroom. the girl i'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and i tell her. she loses it laughing - ""so and so is your assistant?! ahahahah"". i'm not laughing. assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200b;

it's actually a bit of a scene, the girl i'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling assistant and she is not answering. the girl i'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200b;

i've been working from home all week. i've talked to my assistant via slack and we've said nothing. she is in the office. i can't work from home tomorrow. i don't know what the fuck to do. the girl i'm dating said that assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. i really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. we haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200b;

edit:  the diagram(https://imgur.com/a/rr31ebi)!  i'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  i'm not a turkey, i promise.

edit 2: to clarify, i don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  i think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  the diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until i stood up.  at least this is the logic i am convincing myself of.

edit 3:  i'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl i am dating"" because honestly i wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  i don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

edit 4:  yes, they were staring at my butthole.  i'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. to be honest if,

edit 5:

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts.  no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement.  a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  better than jerking off that's for sure.

and yes, i have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

thanks for coming to my ted talk.",4
"in hbo's chernobyl, radiation sickness is depicted as highly contagious, able to be transmitted by brief skin-to-skin contact with a contaminated person. is this actually how radiation works?. to provide some examples for people who haven't seen the show (spoilers ahead, be warned):

1. there is a scene in which a character touches someone who has been affected by nuclear radiation with their hand. when they pull their hand away, their palm and fingers have already begun to turn red with radiation sickness.

2. there is a pregnant character who becomes sick after a few scenes in which she hugs and touches her hospitalized husband who is dying of radiation sickness. a nurse discovers her and freaks out and kicks her out of the hospital for her own safety. it is later implied that she would have died from this contact if not for the fetus ""absorbing"" the radiation and dying immediately after birth.

**is actual radiation contamination *that* contagious?** this article(https://www.livescience.com/13444-radiation-exposure-contagious.html) seems to indicate that it's nearly impossible to deliver radiation via skin-to-skin contact, and that as long as a sick person washes their skin and clothes, they're safe to be around, even if they've inhaled or ingested radioactive material that is still in their bodies.

is chernobyl's portrayal of person-to-person radiation contamination *that* sensationalized? for as much as people talk about the show's historical accuracy, it's weird to think that the writers would have dropped the ball when it comes to understanding how radiation exposure works.",9
"aren't you embarrassed?. recently, i started a second job at a grocery store. i make decent money at my day job (49k+ but awesome benefits, largest employer besides the state in the area) but i have 100k in student loans and $1000 in credit cards i want gone. i was cashiering yesterday, and one of my coworkers came into my store, and into my line!

i know he came to my line to chat, as he looked incredibly surprised when i waved at him and said hello. as we were doing the normal chit chat of cashier and customer, he asked me, ""aren't you embarrassed to be working here?"" i was so taken aback by his rudeness, i just stumbled out a, ""no, it gives me something to do."" and finished his transaction.

as i think about it though, no freaking way am i embarrassed. other then my work, i only interact with people at the dog park (i moved here for my day job knowing no one). at the grocery i can chat with all sorts of people. i work around 15 hours a week, mostly on weekends, when i would be sitting at home anyways.

i make some extra money, and in the two months i've worked here, i've paid off $300 in debt, and paid for a car repair, cash. by the end of the year i'll have all edit: credit card debt paid off, and that's with taking a week off at christmas time.

"i made my school believe they broke my ipad and made them buy me a new one.. my highschool didn't allow phones/tablets to be on your person throughout the school day, instead they made us all hand our devices in every morning and pick them up at the end of the school day. they provided us with these white cushioned envelope bags to protect them by it really did nothing. 

anyway one morning i was rushing to catch the bus and on the way out of my bedroom i decide to throw my ipad onto my bed. but it bounced off, landing face down on the slate tiles. i knew straight away it smashed from the sound, i stood there cursing myself until i had an idea. i grabbed my phone bag and put the broken ipad and shattered glass in it and took it to school. 

i handed it in acting nonchalant about it and when it came time to pick it up in the afternoon i put my best shocked/sad face on as i opened the bag. i went to the nearest teacher and told her that i found my ipad broken. she took me to the office and eventually to the principal. at first she seen suspicious about the entire thing but when my dad (25 year army veteran) came in to pick me up, he gave her and the entire admin staff a spraying.

she originally agreed to pay for it to be repaired but when that couldn't be done she agreed to buy a replacement model. but the thing is that the ipad was a 2nd gen model and it was 2014 so ended up getting a brand new model as well. 

i never admitted it to anyone in school out of fear it would eventually lead to the principal finding out. 

edit: the teacher didn't pay for it, the principal used the schools credit card 

edit: jesus christ guys why would the teacher paid for the ipad! of course the school paid for it!

"update: i (20f) found explicit child pornography on my boyfriend's (27m) phone.. it's been a long night. thank you all for staying patient. also this will be an immensely long post, so buckle in.

first off i just want to say thank you for the massive outpouring of support and love. i'm still trying to work through all of your pm's because i'd like to respond personally to each of you who were kind enough to send me loving words of support. i have been pretty overwhelmed by the amount of people who have commented and through reading every last one of your thoughts. i never imagined this post would gain nearly this level of traction and visibility and it's my hope that if i can provide some description of the course of legal action taken and what advice i used from reddit users, other unfortunate partners who stumble upon cp and find this thread (at least in canada) will have some idea of what recourse they can take.

i also want to state that for anybody who doubts the validity of my claims, i understand. this is an absolutely fucking insane sequence of events and as much as i wish i had the energy to make something like this up for some arbitrary karma, i don't. to provide proof i have sent photographs of identifications and the related arrest paperwork to mods and have worked with them to verify all of what i have written.

yesterday i was picked up by my best friend alex around 2:30. we drove around and talked for a while. i went to school, discovered it was closed (my scatterbrain completely forgot about spring break) and then we went back to his house to discuss all of the comments you had been leaving and come up with a course of action. we drank, talked and after a few hours took a short break from staring at my phone to play some apex. 

alex dropped me back off at my house around 930. david was home, in my room, and immediately i noticed how he was exceptionally quiet and distant. he said he had to admit something to me. i prepared for him to admit to possessing cp but instead he told me about how he had taken some photos of me sleeping; he felt really embarrassed about it but he just didn't know how to bring it up. i feigned surprise and asked him if he had anything else on his phone he wanted to admit to me. he  said no. i asked him to look me in the eyes and tell me that, and he did. i don't know why i was hoping so badly that he would be honest with me about the cp but i really thought he'd admit to it then and there. instead he admitted he had been feeling suicidal the last few months but didn't think he would act on it. he asked me if that changed my perception of him and i said no. he grew quiet again and i left to go shower. when i came back he was getting changed and said he was going to walk for a bit and grab some food. it was about 1030 at this point. when he left, i finally lost it and broke down. i grabbed my cat and hugged him and cried and cried and cried. i was so tired and wanted to shut my brain off so badly. 

i grabbed my phone and dialed the non emergency rcmp line for my city. shaking and crying i explained to the lady on the phone that i had discovered cp on my boyfriend's phone. she put me through to the report line and i spoke to another constable who told me i would be contacted by another officer who would provide more details. i waited for around 10 minutes. the officer advised me that he would need me to come in and provide a recorded audio/video statement. i asked if i could do it over the phone and he said no, it must be done in person so that if this goes to court, crown counsel has clear evidence that i was not coerced into stating what i witnessed. i don't have my full licence yet and because of the late time i wasn't able to make it down there on my own via transit so the cons table said he would come pick me up, asked me if david was there and if i could safely leave without arousing suspicion. luckily david knows about my close family-like relationship with my best friend, so i made up a lie about how my best friend got in a fight with his dad and he wanted to talk to me about it. david didn't seem to question it and i waited for the officer to arrive. 

he called me from a blocked number and i walked outside and down the block to his suv. the constable and another officer greeted me,  i got into the front seat and we drove to the station. during the ride i asked him about whether seizing the phone on my own was a good idea. he explained that i had done everything correctly; laying low and getting my thoughts together to take it to police without notifying david. he said if i had taken david's phone on my own that it would not have been admissible as evidence in court; they would have returned it back to him and he could have deleted all the evidence since suspicion had been roused. it was about 11:15 at this point. they placed me in an interview room and i sat and waiting for about twenty minutes. the officer came back in and explained the process of the interview, that it would take some time and to be as thorough as possible with my answers. he said we could take breaks and brought me some water.

 he started off by asking me details about my life, where i grew up, past employment etc. after that portion he asked me about david, what our relationship was like, whether he was nice and kind to me and anything else i knew about him. i told him he was sweet, that he had been nothing short of lovely in the time we'd been together but i did express that things had been moving very quickly. he agreed. he then got me to explain how i came upon the photos in question, so i did. then came the worst part. he asked me to go through, one at a time, the photos i explicitly remembered details of seeing and to describe it in very, very graphic detail. ie positions of the children, their ethnicity, any identifying characteristics such as clothing, circumcision etc. it was intense but by some grace of god i was able to keep my composure and not burst into tears (mental/emotional exhaustion was fully setting in and i was almost thankful for not having energy to bawl) and provide a clear statement to the officer. he asked me if i would testify in court and i said i would. the officer left a few times during the interview to discuss with his supervisor more questions to ask during the interview and the legalities of the seizure they would attempt. the full interview took around three hours including all the sitting and waiting.

after i had been sitting for what felt like an eternity the officer came in and explained that they felt my interview provided enough reasonable cause to seize his phone and place him under arrest. they explained how the process would go and whether i wanted a no contact agreement.  i said yes initially but the officer asked me if it would be easier to not have one in regards to sorting out his belongings. that made sense to me so i chose not to move forward with the no contact agreement. 

we got in the constable's car and drove down to my house with 2 other officers in 2 different vehicles, 3 in total. i told them i was more comfortable in a squad car than standing outside (i didn't want to face him) so they moved me to the back of the cop car. i've never felt so anxious in my life. i asked them to be mindful of my cats and not let them get outside; they promised they would make sure of that. about 15 minutes later i saw them bringing david out in handcuffs. my heart which had been dissolving in my stomach's acid all day felt completely gone. i curled up in the fetal position in the back of the squad car and waited to be told i could go back inside. after another eternity (my phone had died by this point but i know it was well past 330) they came back and explained he was under arrest but being released with promise to appear in court at a later date. i was told by the officer i could go back in, and that they would help him find his way back to the place he had been staying previously. the officer gave me a victim services card and a hug and instructed me to snuggle my cats tightly, that i did a brave thing and to be well. 

i went back into my house, put planet earth on for background noise and called my other best friend paige who had been keeping up with me about this since i sent her my reddit post. we were talking for almost 45 minutes when my door burst open. it was david. he was frantic, his eyes were wild and he was hyperventilating. my jaw dropped; officers said they would be escorting him back to his prior residence and i was not at all mentally prepared to see him again. paige asked me if everything was okay and i told her david had walked through the door, i would call her back. immediately david came to the bed where i was sitting, dropped to his knees and sobbed violently. he said he didn't know i would be here, he just came to grab a couple more of his belongings. he asked me what the cops had asked myself or told me. i lied and said that they said they had only told me they had suspicions of possession of child pornography. he sobbed more and loudly said ""that isn't me, that isn't me, this isn't who i am"" and cried more and more. his body was wracked with sobs and he apologized over and over again. it was immensely difficult to witness and i wish i could have told him to get the fuck out but i just sat there immobilized, in shock. it was well close to 5 in the morning and i hadn't slept or eaten much in nearly 48 hours at this point so my body and brain felt like they were essentially non-functioning. 

david began and said that this had been something he struggled with after developing an intense porn addiction in his early 20s. i asked him if he had ever been abused sexually and he said no. he said he knew how horrible it was to seek these images out, but had no inclination or desire to ever touch any children, he had never acted on these thoughts and never would. i asked him why he had never sought treatment before, and he admitted that he was terrified of what people would think, he had no idea what resources to access and he felt ashamed. he said his previous suicide attempts in years prior were directly linked to the fact that he considered himself a pedophile. i nodded. i asked him if they would find anything on his phone that would incriminate him and he said yes, they were going to. he admitted they were very explicit photos and i asked how he even found them; i don't recall we ever got to that. he promised me he didn't use my internet to access it but i don't really believe that. he apologized to me more times than i could count and asked if i hated him. i told him i wasn't sure that i felt hatred for him but i was sure of being beyond disappointed in his actions; i told him how terribly i felt betrayed and hurt and violated. i expressed my sadness in what he had done, the innocence of these exploited children, how he had so much potential to do so much good in the world and how disappointed this was the route he chose.  

then i heard a loud knock on the door and lights outside my windows. three officers were outside, two of whom i recognized from earlier and they asked me if david was here. i said he was, and they said they were coming to perform a wellness check because paige had called in. i realized i had completely forgotten to text her back and let her know i was okay, bless her heart. the officers took david outside and they each asked him if they had any cause to worry about his actions tonight and he promised them they did not. i told them i was okay; that i would finish my discussion with him and if i had any issues i had them on speed dial. they nodded and left. 

david sobbed and sobbed for what felt like a millennium and i just sat and well, endured it. tears just ran and ran and ran from him. he said he knew what he was saying was cliche; that he was sure i expected to hear this great big apology. he said if i thought he was being manipulative he could understand but assured me he was at his rock bottom and wanted me to know how horrible he felt about not only what he'd done, but what i had to go through. i just nodded. there was silence for a long time, i think by this point it was around 8 or 830 in the morning. i don't know how long i stared at my tv screen that said ""are you still watching: planet earth?"" but it could have been a lifetime. i had no concept of time or what to do or say or what was the right way to feel. i think david was either silent or had fallen asleep against my bed. i didn't know or care, i was just numb. i would have probably sat like that until i died but two of my four cats descended on my bed and meowed for food. i got up, fed my little critters and cats and came back to my bed. my brain wasn't capable of thought so i stared at my tv screen until i passed out sometime around 9. 

i didn't sleep for long because when i woke up and checked my phone it said 11:30. david was awake and crying still. when he realized i was awake he sat up and looked at me immensely pained. i just stared at him. he started apologizing and apologizing more. he expressed his life was over, he had nobody and nothing and that i was his greatest light in life, how he never wanted to lose me. he expressed how much he cared about me and how he would do anything to win my affections back; to get me to give him a second chance. i shook my head and he sobbed, sobbed, sobbed,  apologizing non-stop. at this point i finally asked him to leave. i told him i needed space to sort out my emotions, and i needed to get some sleep.  i asked him if he would be okay. he nodded and grabbed his things. he said he would get out of my life and not contact me if that's what i wanted him to do. i said nothing. he expressed how much he loved me and again how sorry he was, and that if there was every any chance of anything happening between us ever again that he would be there. he said i love you about ten million times and grabbed his bag and stepped out of my door.

i've been laying in bed since then and writing this. i just want this to be over. i just want to move on and figure out how to sort the mess that remains. also i think i forgot to add that his court date is set for june. as far as sentencing, if he's found guilty of possession of child pornography i believe he could be sentenced to 18 months max and a minimum sentence of 90 days.  i will post updates again if i feel  they are important; otherwise i will update again in june when he has been sentenced and let you know what charges are laid.

thank you all again for your support, kindness, and love. i have never in my life experienced such an outpouring of generosity and compassion and i would have been so lost without some of your advice. i'll continue working on replying to your pm's, but in the meantime i think i'm going to try and finally get some god damned sleep.

tldr: filed a secondary report over the phone, provided a audio/video interview to police and they arrested david and seized his phone. he signed a promise to appear in court in june. he awaits sentencing.

"grandparents have lost $30k to lottery scams. they took out a $150k loan to pay for another. how can i help?. my grandparents (80 and 85, georgia) get phonecalls from ""the department of treasury"" letting them know they have won $xxx, xxx and all they need to do is send $1000 to some person for ""taxes"" and then they will receive the money.

to my knowledge, they have sent $30k in total.

the situation at hand: my grandma got a letter saying she won $4.5 million from ""mega million"" and she has to put up $150k (the lottery fund is putting up $250k ""on her behalf"") and then she will get 4.5m. she also is told she will receive a 2017 mercedes. she is awaiting a loan for the 150k to come through.

she is keeping this as secret as possible from her two children (50s). i do not know what to do. my grandparents are okay financially, but this loan would be an extreme hardship.

things we have tried (as a family):
- blocking phone numbers on their phones
- calling the scammers ourselves
- showing them google searches that indicate the phone numbers belong to scammers
- having friends in the police come to their house and read the letters and give their opinion

clearly nothing is working. any advice would be great, thank you.",10

"after 13 years clean and 8 years of marriage, i did heroin 3 weeks ago and almost came close to fully relapsing.. i was a heroin addict in the lower east side of manhattan in the 1990s as a teen. i got clean at 21 years old after years of abuse. i got married at 26 to my amazing and beautiful wife. she knows i was an addict. 

i spent all these years not even really thinking that much about the concept of relapsing. it had been *so long*. i still thought about it, but with marriage and my kids and everything the thought of it was just so ridiculously out of sight to even consider trying it again. 

3 weeks ago, it was my friends birthday. he is 4 years younger than me so of course he wants to go to some cool hip sketchy bar/club thing in bushwick. 

i got drunk, really drunk. i hadn't really drank much at all in the past few years so my tolerance was way lower than expected. there was a dealer outside and a few other junkies nearby. i don't even fully remember what happened, i just remember going with them, abandoning my friend at the bar (it was like 1am anyways), and going to some apartment and shooting up. i spent the night there, then all the way until noon the next day. i had 10 missed calls. 

i panicked when i came out of my daze. i told my wife i had gotten way too drunk and was puking and my phone was out of battery so i stayed at charlies house. she was disappointed i didn't tell her but also thought it was funny because she used to tease me for not being able to handle my liquor. this was a ""i told you so"" moment, she had told me not to drink too much before i went to the bar. she wasn't even in new york, she was at a summer house with the kids in massachusetts. 

i spent the next 4 days until they got back just... riddled with anxiety, urges to get more heroin, horrific mind zaps (i dont even know what to call them). it was, in some ways, worse than my withdrawal symptoms when i first was an addict. not because of the physical feeling, but the horrible mental feeling of what i was possibly giving up, my wife and kids. i wanted to fucking get more so badly. i left my house to find heroin 4 fucking times. 4 times, i gave up to get more, but wasn't able to find any and snapped back to reality and went back home. i still thank fucking god i did not somehow run into some street dealer during those 4 times. i would have absolutely done it. 

i feel like everything i thought about myself, that i was strong, that my addiction was behind me, that i had beat heroin... it was all gone. i am not going to say i am back at square one or anything, i am not. but i feel like something inside of me has reset. my unwavering strength against addiction was broken at the slightest temptation. i still am weak. heroin is so, so much stronger than me. its truly unbelievable how much stronger it is than me. 

when i was young, my aunt had cancer. she beat it. then it came back soon after, and she beat it again. it didn't come back, and we loved how strong she was for fighting her cancer and that she had overcome it. she lived with us. i remember her feeling of strength after her 2nd year of not having cancer, her 3rd year, her 6th year.... it finally felt like it was gone for good. her thinking ""its finally behind me now, its a part of my past"", and then it just fucking came back. 9 years after her first diagnosis, it came back and killed her. i remember her feelings and how she felt about it. so many years after she thought it had gone away. 

that is how i feel. like a cancer which i thought i got rid of a decade ago just showed back up on my screening. 

the first 5-6 days after i tried it that time outside the bar were the worst. my kids and wife have come back. the urges mostly went away the second i saw my kids. i hugged them so damn hard. 

and i never told my family what happened, nor will i ever. my wife never understood that side of me, she met me 5 whole years after i was clean. i just cannot have her know, ever. 

i won't do it again. i am planning on not drinking to excess like that again, except maybe in very specific situations like at the summer house where there is no option of drugs. i mean, not like i want to get drunk again like that, but just in case i ever want to get loose? i am never doing that in the city again. 

i am still about 90%+ sure that i won't ever touch heroin again. i am still positive in myself about it. its just... it used to be 99% sure. that is what fucking terrifies me. 

i said heroin is stronger than me. it is absolutely stronger than me. but the reason i won't ever do it again is that it isn't stronger than my family, my wife and kids. i don't care about how good it feels, i will not subject my wife and children to me being an addict. i would rather just kill myself than that.

"update:for objecting to 'girls day'?. hello,

this is an update to my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/au9bhn/aita_for_objecting_to_girls_day/

this last month has been kind of wild for me so i haven't had an opportunity to update this until now. so the descriptions of my family and my family situation in this thread was specific enough that one of my family members found out about it and confronted me. due to the fact that i had deactivated my facebook and was only receiving text messages, i didn't realize what was happening before i was ambushed by it. my sister (oldest) confronted me about it and asked if it was me who made the thread and i confirmed that it was. and she insisted i was being shitty for airing the family's laundry like that. i responded that i in no way did that as i was speaking very generally and never identified who my family was. 

this spread to my family and now the thread was shared on facebook and everyone was shown. i was invited to a family meeting (we never have those) where i was sat in front of a firing squad of angry women who told me that what i did was wrong and demanded an apology. they said that 'i knew' they weren't excluding me and because i gave everyone that impression i owed them an apology. i replied that i absolutely did not know they were not excluding me, and included examples of things they did (such as the birthday dinner, going to an amusement park, and going to a baseball game). once again they characterized this as a girls only event of fun where boys just weren't allowed or welcome because they wanted to talk about things guys wouldn't be interested in. i replied that she needs to stop saying 'guys' because there is only one guy who would have been invited and that's me, so what she's really saying it its a no-op event, not a girls only event.  they explained that it wasn't excluding me because regardless of whether i was interested in the event the conversation would have bored me because i'm not a girl. at this point we were going around in circles so i just explained my perspective, i said that i'm the only male in our immediate family, when the people in my immediate family get together on a regular basis (not a one off or once in a while) and don't include me, regardless of what they called it i feel excluded. i explained that the breaking point was the family vacation, and that there was absolutely no reason to leave me out of a vacation i was always invited to, particularly when that's the only family vacation we do and they've stated they cannot afford a second one. 

at the end of this family meeting, i was never given an apology, no one tried to empathize with my perspective, and i was accused of many things that i didn't do by any reasonable interpretation. i told my mother and my sisters that we reached a breaking point in our relationship and that i was going no contact for a while. i told them i'm an adult, and i have my own life, and the reason i wanted to be involved was because i didn't want one of those family relationships where you only see your family at holidays. if that's not what my family wants then it's okay, but i told them that i was not going to be involved with people who made me feel shitty and intentionally leave me on the outside looking in of my own family. my mother/sisters told me that if i was going to lie about them to everyone that they don't care. at this point, my relationship with my family is over, i left that family meeting and have not reactivated facebook and have not received any contact and have not initiated any contact. que sera, sera.

"paying attention to my 401k saved my company's employees ~$92,000. this is a post about how even a little bit of attention can go a long way for you, and others. 

i work for a company with ~600 employees across north america. since finding the personal finance communities two years ago, my family has been keeping an eye on our budgeting and saving, and i was having fun with it, so i started also keeping track of contributions into my 401k - nothing major, just a yearly look to see contributions, matches (my company matches 4%), and dividends.

one year i logged into my 401k provider (fidelity) and ran my transaction history total for a year, and what caught my eye was a fee for $12.50. to that date i had never seen a fee before. i called my hr/benefits and they confirmed they had jumped the gun but that - starting next year - every employee would have a $12.50 recordkeeping fee charged yearly. they reimbursed me the $12.50 for that year, but i learned a lesson: 401ks (and the hr departments behind a company) were not infallible.  i added 'fees' to my mental thing to check on during my year-end check.

2 years went by, until this last year. this year in february i pulled the 2018 totals for my 401k, and noticed that my contribution and my year-end total seemed off, by about $150 or so. i couldn't figure it out. finally, i went to the transaction history of my 401k and looked through it. and there i saw it: a company **match** of *negative* $153.95, back in march. it was the strangest thing! it wasn't tied to any actual contribution; it was just sitting out there, all by itself. it wasn't even listed under 'fees'. it was just a *negative* company match. (shout out to everyone who has ever complained about their company match or lack thereof - at least you've never had a *negative* one!) and i knew it wasn't just those dollars i was missing - it was all those dollars that those dollars were going to make, and the dollars *those* dollars would make, for decades to come. 

i started asking around. my hr department said there were no reported problems and that if i wanted a detailed walkthrough of my 401k contributions, i could wait two weeks until i had a meeting with the benefits coordinator. i said, 'schedule it'. but i didn't stop there. i started asking my coworkers, and guess what - *everyone* had a negative company match on that date. i had 5 confirmed cases, then 10, then 20. the amounts all varied, but it was always on the same march date. 

by this point i got enough people riled up that i ended up talking to the head of benefits, who confirmed that, okay, maybe there was a problem. it took 2 months for them to confirm, at which point we found out that a payroll 'true-up' calculation had incorrectly counted a week that crossed from year-to-year as two weeks, and then had automatically 'corrected' for the doubled amount. it took 2 more months for them to finally correct it. i'm sure some of my coworkers contribute less and some contribute way more, but 600 employees * $153.95 = $92,370.  meaning that every person in the company had a hand in some $92000 missing from their 401k... but i was the only one who had bothered to check. 

i know most people don't ever calculate out their paycheck or look at their 401k. and i'm not saying you should on a daily, weekly, or even monthly basis. but every once in a while, take 5 or 10 minutes and grab that paper copy of your paycheck, or hit that 'forgot password' button, log on to your system, and take a little look over how much money you're getting - be it paycheck, 401k, or whatever - and see whether it makes sense to you. you might be surprised what you find.

"for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.. i have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that i hang out with almost every day. we've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, john. 

i never really liked john. he was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. he was also incredibly pretentious. a friend of mine said ""einstein"" once and john interrupted him to say, ""i have no idea who you are talking about. do you mean the reknown scientist albert einshtein?"". i once put up a snapchat story saying, ""i love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""it's called gridiron you moron"".  i don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

on one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. john was kind of tipsy. we had some new girls show up so i was kinda working my charm on them. they asked me what i did and i went ""i'm a biomed engineer"". i don't know why that triggered john so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how i'm just a drone in a rat race. he kept telling me about how i'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. he later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

every time i mention work or anything, john would start roasting me. he nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though i expressed multiple times that i dont like to be called a drone. he would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what i do. that really pissed me off. once i told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""what are you going to do, fight me? i dare you to swing"". i didn't want to fight him so now i started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

over the last few months or so i kinda went frontpage a couple of times on reddit and everyone was like, ""damn m0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). that triggered him even more. he'd say stuff like ""his posts suck. they're not even funny. reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


at this point it is relevant to bring up what john does. he's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at starbucks. how good is he? honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a dslr, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. i'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an instagram post about how national georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. at the party, i apologized to him (i hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""i'm sorry you didn't get nat geo"". to which he got angry again and said, ""i'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. what i'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so i actually feel sorry for you"". he said stuff like this in front of a girl i was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

that's it. i fucking lost it. we were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with john and i took that opportunity to say, ""well john, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder nat geo rejected you. you're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iphone camera. you're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *i get cut off here*"" 

his dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. john came charging at me but everyone just held him back. the rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and i got kicked out. no one has talked to me since the incident and john blocked me from all social media. our group chat has been pretty silent too. john also apparently made a roast post about me. idk if i should apologize to him or not. sorry for the long post. i know john is an asshole, but aita?

"(az) our neighbors dog was poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" (a very nebulous term). wife says we should let them because we have nothing to hide. i say absolutely not. how should we proceed?. i guess some background is in order here. earlier this  year a new set of neighbors moved in and they brought with them 3 very loud dogs who they let bark and bay 24 hours a day. we were the first people to go talk with them and they got better for maybe 20 minutes and they just let the dogs back outside to continue on.

 our city has a policy where noise complaints can be made to animal control so we did that which did nothing. the next step was to go to a city sponsored mediation at which point the dog's owners agreed to keep them inside. they did this for maybe 3 days and then we were back to square one. the next step is to take them before a judge who gave them a pretty hefty fine with the admonition to take care of the problem. this all took about 10 months with literally only a days total of these dogs not barking. 

so they were quiet for about a month after the court date but slowly and surely they started barking again at all hours. we tried to go over and speak to them but this time they very clearly insinuated that barking dogs were their ""right"" and we needed to get the fuck off their property. 

so we decided the only way was to start the process over with animal control as well as contacting our own lawyer to see about taking them to civil court. we have yet to contact the lawyer. 

we had made the initial report to animal control last thursday when we got a knock on our door and it was a uniformed police officer who said something like ""do you have any antifreeze?"" i was really taken aback and i think i asked ""i think so, do you need some?"" 

he then spoke something into the walkie talkie on his epulat and asked if he could come. i literally had no idea what was going on and then he explained that one of the neighbors dogs had been poisoned and asked if we knew them. i explained that i actually didn't know who he was talking about (the other two dogs hadn't stopped barking after the other dog died, and i really have no way of knowing which dog is which). he said it was this family and said that they had told him we  had a history of ""being cruel to his dogs."" i got out the whole file folder including my logs talking to the neighbors, the calls to animal control, my copy of the letters, mediation agreement and judges order as well as written down links to the youtube channel we created in order to document the barking via audio. 


the officer then asked if he could take everything. i said i wasn't comfortable with that but i would be happy to make a copies today at work and drop them off at the local substation. i did exactly this. i was met by a uniformed supervisor who said that he would like to send a ""specialist"" over to our house and look through our ""internet history"" to see what we've been looking up. again i was taken completely aback and said that i'm not sure what he'd be looking for. he told me that was up to them to decide what they'd be looking for. it took me as second but i asked him to better define ""specialist"" and ""internet history"" and he said that at this time he couldn't do that for me. i asked him if somehow we were suspects and he said (if i remember) ""not yet."" 
i asked him if i could leave, he said yes and again asked if his ""specialist"" could come over tonight. i said i would really rather not but i would get back in touch with him. he gave me his card and we said goodbye. 

i just got home and told my wife. my wife insists that we invite him over right now to have them look through our computer. we have nothing on there that would tie us to any sort of dog death but i feel it's insane to just the police look through the nebulous ""internet history"" without them being very specific as to who is doing and what they are looking for. 

she thinks that by not letting them we are making ourselves look very guilty. i say we are not guilty because we aren't freaking guilty and it's there job to find out who really did it. it sucks those people's dog died but we have followed the letter of the law and been exceedingly patient even though our once quiet house has been miserable for almost a year. i'm actually really annoyed that our willingness to play by the rules seemed to highlight us. 

thank you very much for any advice. 

tl;dr: neighbors dog was apparently poisoned. police want to look through our ""internet history"" with no real defined purpose or reason. wife thinks we should let them, i say absolutely not.

"my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. nsfw. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

so, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, sarah 31f, my long-time partner, john 34m, and myself 29f.

i've known that sarah has had a crush on john for a long time. it's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, sarah has never crossed any boundaries. but because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(my boyfriend and i had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while i'm sleeping. she took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. she apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

i found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad i'm being abused.

but here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. he took the photos and videos *for me*. the day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so i can watch them because it's better than porn. 

but nobody believes me. they're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. i don't know what to do. i'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

how do i fix my friendships and convince everybody that **i'm** the one who wanted it? 

there is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but i do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. i'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

please help. i'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

edit: since this needs to be said, yes, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. it's a four digit code.

edit edit: 

- yes, i *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- i have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. just *mostly* everybody. i was upset and generalizing last night.

- i am in the us.

- my boyfriend **does have a passcode** on his phone. seriously. stop blaming him. this is *definitely* not his fault.

edit again since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and i: we attended a bbq where everybody left their phones inside. we *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

you guys are being a little mean about this.

**edit** (again): 

went to the police and will update when i can.

## minor update 

i went to the police last night, alone. after everything that was said, i was nervous about having john with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

really. y'all made me nervous.

i went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

at first, the officer at the window was like, ""i think that's a crime? maybe? i've gotta call my supervisor.""

that happened twice before the police were like, okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. we're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

i gave my report and left. about fifteen minutes later, i got a phone call from the local pd. they told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

my comments being that sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue john and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

they suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, i'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

so, that's about it. 

a bunch of hemming and hawing and i don't knows. they'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

i'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",7
"someone used my credit card and ordered two 256gb iphone x's to my house.. weird thing happened to me recently...

i received a call from visa asking if i had recently made some large purchases . i replied ""no i haven't "". 


**the charges:**


$5000 ( triggered fraud alert)


$800 (went through, iphone on contract maybe?)


$800 (went through)








the bank then told me someone just called them pretending to be me and my card was compromised.

a week later i get two packages in the mail. i open them up, two 256gb iphone x's. one silver, one black.

**i'm guessing this is what happened:**

1) the fraudsters were testing the waters with the iphones before they made the big purchase.

2) they were hoping to intercept the package .

3) they just messed up.



anyone have this happen to them? 

**edit :**

- yes the charges were reversed.

- i still have the phones

- i'm going to contact visa about what to do.

- i don't have kids 

- not on any medications / wasn't drunk 

- getting a lot of messages about people wanting to buy them. im going to try and return them. they're not for sale :p 

- i don't need legal troubles. i highly doubt they won't come looking for these phones. 

- my apartment doesn't have gas. (carbon monoxide poisoning)

- what the frick?



**wow front page! , thanks everyone for all of the responses. helps a ton!**


**update 3:00pm pst:** talked with visa & credit security agent. they told me they don't deal with the packages / returns and that i should contact the merchant/cell phone provider. i am going to be contacting the credit bureau in the morning as well.
 

**update 4:00pm pst:** currently on the phone with cell phone provider. closing any accounts the fraudsters may have opened.


**update 4:30pm pst:** talked to the cell phone provider. no account was created under my name and they can't trace this purchase to me because i don't have an account. they told me i should just wait and see if they contact me again. they said they can't accept any returns because i need an account number (which i don't have).

**update 5:00pm pst:** just realized something... the address it was sent to is a number off. my address ends in a 2, the slip ends in a 4. it does have my name on it etc. it got to my house because the delivery guys know our last name most likely. the plot thickens. i do have new neighbours , but i don't think they could pull this off. super strange. 

**update 6:00pm pst:** just checked, the address ending in 4 isn't the new neighbours, they're my other neighbours, and they're pretty old.  i don't think i'm going to get much more info on this. i'm thinking i'll wait for a while before i consider the phones mine. i don't want to open it and then get charged for it. they may even be deactivated from apples side anyways. i'll open one after one month. 
 
**update 6:17pm pst:** proof https://imgur.com/a/lvkwf

**update (next day) 12:20pm pst:** 
i just called credit bureaus. the fraudsters tried to make cell phone accounts in my name. for some reason the cell phone provider couldn't find my name on file.  it's officially identity fraud at this point, and there will be an investigation. if anyone is in canada and this has happened to you, please call your bank as well as the following numbers.

**equifax**

1-866-205-0681

**trans union**

1-800-663-9980

**canadian anti fraud centre**

1-888-495-8501


funny thing just happened. trans union gave me the canadian anti fraud number, and i mistyped it. i typed 800 instead of 888 and it went to a sex line. for a second i thought i had been elaborately scammed and all of the people were it on it, then i realized the mistake.

"a mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up. so, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  he glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  when he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  he thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

a few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  he glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  he thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

the next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  he opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  the mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*ding-dong, ding-dong.  ding-dong, ding-dong.  ding-dong, ding-dong.*

the door opens and standing there is a stout buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

""pardon me, sir,"" the mailman says, ""but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it's only going to end up back at your home in a few days.""

""ah, my letter.  thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  please do so again"" replies the buddhist monk.

""but sir,"" says mailman, ""you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.""

""but that is my intention, dear man,"" replies the buddhist monk.  ""you see, reposting is the best way to get karma.""

"i have to move out at 18, what do i do?. i won't bring up the specific details, but long story short, my parents are legitimately crazy, one of those extreme situations where everything i do must be kept secret (talking to friends, working a normal job, etc).

luckily in the middle of last year i got a job with my brother, he told my parents he would not pay me, then paid me in secret. since then i have about 10k saved up, but recently they have made it very difficult to even work because i am assuming they somehow figured out i am being paid. because of this, i will likely lose my job and my income, however, i do have experience working with people, writing resumes, doing interviews, so i don't think getting another job will be super difficult. the main issue for me is how can i get out of this house as quickly as possible? for a while i thought that maybe these things my parents do were normal, but the more i am exposed to the real world (mostly through the internet, which i had very little access to until about 2 years ago) i found out these things are in fact extreme and unusual.

for a bit more context, i am 17, no car, no license (parents won't let me get one), no friends who would be willing to let me live with them (socializing was very hard because i was homeschooled) i have a associate's degree and as i said, 10k saved up. whats my best course of action to get away?

"found out my dead best friend was in love with my wife. light

i'm writing this as a confession because i don't know where else to speak about this and i don't want my kids finding this out on my main account.

my friend died a few months back due to heart problems. he was taking care of himself so it was a shock to everyone. especially his wife who was with him at their house when he died. due to this she decided to move somewhere else and because she and her daughter were still distraught she asked me to pack up his stuff.

he had some boxes in his basement and after a while i started feeling nostalgic and decided to look into them. i found pictures of us from when we were kids all the way to before we got married. that was enough to make me feel bad and i just got back to taping them up. 

but one of the boxes seemed to be in much better condition, so i decided to check it in case it was something important. to my surprise i found out pictures of him and my wife from when we used to hang out together, as well as more recent pictures from family reunions. the most recent being from my wife's birthday party. 

alongside the pictures there were letters that he never sent her. the first one dated 2 months before i met her. the last one was also the same date of her birthday party. there was one that stood out the most was one from after i started dating her. he wrote that his time had passed and since my happiness was as important as his own he would watch over us.

i'll keep his box safe since it isn't my secret to reveal.",11

my mom and step dad are really into ""new age"" science and beliefs. i've never agreed with them on this and didn't know how extreme it was. recently though they have become involved in a extremely weird ""support group"". i say that in quotes because i have no fucking clue who they are. when i'm around they never mention any group names or what ""organization"" they work for or are apart of. because of this i have not had much luck finding out stuff as ""new age cult"" gives to many results to look into.

&#x200b;

this monday my mom and stepdad sat me and my 4 siblings down. they told us that we will be moving at the end of the month to a more ""stable"" location within a spiritual community. according to them they plan to pull all 5 of us (im 16, couldn't think of anywhere else to mention this.) out of school here and enroll us in their ""mind awakening"" school where ever we move. i tried to get anything out of them but they refused to talk to me at all about it. according to them because i'm still a child in ""mind, body, and spirit"" i need to listen to them not ask questions. i've actually been freaking out since then and have been trying to get advice but i've been unable too. they cut of the internet, phone and tv tuesday and they have been keeping a fucking lazer focus on me and my siblings since then. i'm currently at a friends house and this is the only way i've actually got access to the internet. this seems like a cult 100% to me. last night they had 3 people come and talk to me and my siblings and the stuff they told us was fucking crazy. i was talked to alone by an old man who told me about how my mind is ""closed"" and that i will slowly learn to open it as my parents have and that the ""leaders"" will love to meet me and put me in their programs.

&#x200b;

i need to know what the fuck i can do here. my dad has shared custody of me and since monday i've had no contact with him. he is supposed to have a call with me every night but my mom claims he's been ""informed"" and supports this 100%. i tried calling him this morning but he didn't answer. he lives in another state so it's kinda hard to get into contact with him outside of phone and email. i'm at a friends house because i was able to leave the house for the first time in a week this morning after i told my parents i wanted to go to the park but came here and told my friend everything. her parents are not home but she's trying to call them and i plan to stay here tonight if i can. my parents have forbid me from using the internet because it's ""full of lies from them"".

&#x200b;

i'm so lost right now it makes me sick. i do not want to go with them to this obvious compound and i need to know what the fuck i can do here. can i just run away and if my parents harbor me can they get in trouble. if my mom has been lying about my dad can he do anything? thanks.

&#x200b;

edit:

i talked to my mom and told her because i would be moving soon and this might be one of the last times i could see my friend i would like to stay the night and she said it was ok and that this family was ""trustworthy not to try and corrupt my view"". i got into contact with my dad and he's pissed. he did not agree and was told i didn't want to talk to him. my 15 year old sister's dad was told the same despite the fact he has primary custody and she only spends the summers with us. my sisters dad is going to call cps too and i just got done with my call to them but i wont repeat what they said here. i will be spending the night here and when my mom asks me to come back tomorrow my dad has told me not to go back and tell her that he will be flying down here to florida immediately if i don't check in with him or he hears i went back to her. he says that he is already looking into emergency custody (i want to thank my friends parents real quick because holy fuck have they been great. they both have been great and are working with my dad right now to help me). i also will be going and buying a burner phone tomorrow and withdrawing all my money from the bank. my dad says he will handle getting my stuff from my mom when the time comes. thanks guys for the advice.",2

"police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while i was asleep. this has been a really weird morning... not sure if i chose the correct flair

i have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. he sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. i put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. around 3am i got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. she gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

at 6:30am i am awoken by a single low knocking sound. i get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point i usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more z's). as i exit my room i am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. i dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if i should serve them a drink. one cop asks me who i am to which i reply with my full name and ask what is going on. he continues his interrogation, asking if i live with a woman. fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. i answer that i live with my girlfriend. the cop asks me if i have a son to which i reply yes. he asks me where he is. at this point i lean over the wall and i see my door busted upen. i am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so i look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. i see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" the tell me to step out into the dining room and i put my hands up as i walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. i sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. i look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex i live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 the cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. he says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. he claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. they never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. my apartment has weird acoustics and i cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

he asks me why i didnt hear him and i told him i must have been deeply asleep. he asks if i am under the influence of drugs and i say i just went to bed late because i was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. as the cops leave i could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. the cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. i asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. i asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

so now i am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. i fear when i go outside i'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

i have been trying to understand the timeline of events. i went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. if the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. my son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. the cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" not a crying child. my son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? what about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? was that just an excuse to burst in? he sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

"i lie about having my university degree and it got me a great job. i went to an ivey league university in ontario canada right after high school. my marks weren't great but they were good enough to squeeze me in. i spent most of my time in university partying rather than studying but still managed to pass all of my first year classes. in my second year i skipped a lot of classes and was very lazy with the course work. my marks were terrible and i failed a couple of my courses. in my third year about half way through i dropped out and got a job landscaping. 

&#x200b;

i did that for a year when i realized it really sucked and i began to regret not trying harder while i was in school. i figured i would apply to jobs that would normally require the degree that i would have gotten. i had spent the few years in school i was easy enough to make the timeline on my resume make sense and although i dropped out i had a decent knowledge of the area. 

&#x200b;

the field i was attempting to enter is difficult start out in and it took a few months of sending applications to get an interview. the company i got an interview with (my now current employer) is an internationally recognized name in the energy sector. i was extremely surprised to get my interview. one of the documentation requirements was university transcripts and with an hour or two in photoshop i had my proof of graduation. i sent in the papers with the other required information and never heard anything back describing any problems with my records. i ended up going through three interviews in the process and received a position.

&#x200b;

i have have now been working with this company for almost 5 years. they provided all the necessary job training and nobody has ever questioned my education. i entered with a starting salary of $72,500 cdn and received annual raises. upon hiring me i was told that the management staff was quite impressed with me through the hiring process and that they usually only hire applicants with minimum requirement of a masters degree.

&#x200b;

i basically shit my pants everyday while in the interview/training process but now i don't really think about it ever. i didn't tell me university friends i faked having my degree. the only people that know i did this are my parents.

just did bullet form for brevity 

got a new job about three months ago from a competitor of my old employer. decent pay increase as a project manager, fortune 300

when getting hired, was told my team was getting assembled, and was given some prelim work to do but was warned it may be a week or two. cool with me, got me time to get acclimated

i complete the work a lot sooner than expected, and, after asking my boss if there was anything to do and being told ""not yet"" sit on my thumbs for a few days, assuming hr will be in touch with the status of the hires

about a month goes by, and still nothing. i try to be helpful, e-mailing other managers asking if they needed a second eye on anything, and asking my boss/a few people under me if they need help on any projects, yet no long term goal can be found and for the most part i essentially do nothing but play on my phone and day trade. (i have my own office).

i check in weekly with a member of hr, alternating between a few as to not piss them off, but hear little back.

eventually, my boss retires, and the new interim guy is from another department, i'm friendly with him, but its clear he's a bit over his head, so i figured i'd wait a few days to let him know my situation. eventually though, he comes into my office to ""thank me"" for doing good work on the initial pre setup i had done a month ago. after that, he essentially leaves me to my own devices. at this point, i had written close to a dozen e-mails to hr, and even my bosses boss, but always got non committal responses. eventually due to learned response i kind of give up and just figure someone will tell me eventually.

it's now been close to three months and outside of extremely minor favor tasks and my initial pre planning, i've essentially done nothing, and have not been asked what i'm doing once. i occasionally walk around the production floor with a clipboard taking notes so i'm seen, but i seriously feel like even if i didn't no one would notice. my new boss doesn't seem to realize i'm one of his workers, and essentially leaves me alone, lost in the shuffle of a huge company.

a bit annoying, but i'm not complaining and i have documented proof of me trying to fix this situation. until someone notices though, i'm happy playing words with friends and day trading while getting 35 an hour",11

"running as an adult should be socially accepted. i'm not talking about running sportively, i'm talking about running just to get somewhere faster. why can't i do it without people judging me? i have the body condition and energy to do so and i don't want to spend 15min walking. 

everytime an adult is seen running, people automatically think that he is late, or that he is running from something dangerous, or that something is wrong in general. people are limited to walking.



edit: to people saying that i should just ignore the judgment because no one cares: i'm kinda known in this part of the city, since it's mainly a student's neighborhood, so yeah, people care

"for insisting if i can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?. throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

so i 20m live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend 23f, a guy from my uni course 20m and his cousin 26f. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. 

about six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years 21m. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. 

so the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

my potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and i'm trying to make that point. am i really the asshole here?

eta: some questions people keep asking: 
1. if i knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something i'd have included it. i'm not aware of anything he does and when i ask why 26f doesn't like him i just get a shrug and ""just do"". i will also state i'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners i've had. 
2. we don't hang out in the living room much. we literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that i can't get on my bedroom tv and there's nobody else in there. we use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. a lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26f, *not* my best friend. my best friend is 23f. not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago i was moving out of halls at university and 23f was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. at the same time, a dude from my course - 20m - was looking for a flatshare. we couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26f - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. i only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. by chronic fatigue i mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",3
"my wife has fallen for the anti-vax nonsense and refuses to vaccinate our child! i'm growing very worried. posting this here as well as r/vaxxhappened 

title says it all. we've been married for 3 years now. she's always been one for quirky, ""against-the-grain"" thinking and interests. however, it's not just harmless things like believing there's no gold in ft.knox, taking pictures of trash in ""aesthetic poses"", or doodling interesting little paintings of naked women laying with trees, anymore... no, it was little things like that which made me fall in love with her. but now there's this anti-vax bullshit. 

she got sucked into one of those anti-vax facebook indoctrination camps by one of her brain dead friends who takes pride in the fact she's worked at a fucking wawa for 10 years. she messaged my wife shortly after she posted pics of our newborn on facebook. 

i love my wife but she somehow manages to be the most stubborn individual on the planet while simultaneously being the most gullible and malleable. shortly after birth (because this was pre-brainwashing) our child received her vitamin k shot, and the hep-b vaccine. however, now she's refusing to give our child any of the other vaccines. 

i know that in her mind, she's coming from a place of love for our child but as you can imagine, this has caused a considerable amount of strain and we've had a number of arguments already. all her arguments/counter-arguments follow the same general outline. 

""oh well if you look this graph you'll see that the numbers of cases for <x disease> have risen alongside the increased use of <y vaccine>""

""i'm the mother here, this is a mothers instinct, i know i'm right, a mother knows best, etc etc etc..."" 

i've tried explaining to her the basic idea of ""correlation doesn't equal causation."" by showing her that as ice cream sales increase, so too do the murder rates. she followed that one up with ""we aren't talking about ice cream and murder, we're talking about vaccines and debilitating diseases! they're completely different!""

i've tried showing her the statistics detailing the infant mortality rates in lesser developed countries where vaccination isn't as pertinent and that vaccines are effective. she follows that up with ""those statistics are created by think tanks funded by the government and ""big-pharma""

she won't budge and hasn't budged for weeks now. our arguments are devolving into the same tired routine over and over again and i'm worried that the only thing which will wake her up is our child being afflicted by some horrible disease like measles which could've been easily avoided. 

i am in florida. is there anyway i can sneakily just bring my child to the doctor and have her vaccinated without my wife's knowledge? what are my options here? legally speaking, what kind of leeway do i have? i don't want this to lead to divorce but i just feel quite lost at the moment. 

edit: thank you to everyone for your advice! i come to the decision that i will try and sit my wife down one last time, as i am skeptical to go behind her back because she may take it as an unforgivable breach of trust, and that is not the outcome i desire. if that fails, i have decided to get my child vaccinated without her knowledge and letting her believe otherwise, because i know that is the best thing for my marriage and my child. will keep you updated",2
"traveling only appeals to boring people or people who haven't traveled. i've traveled everywhere. the uk, germany, france, india, bangladesh, about half of the us (including california, las vegas, new york, minneapolis, tennessee, hawaii, you get the idea)

"i 26m upset a woman 20sf and my friends are acting like i'm in the wrong.. hey guys.

i went out clubbing last night with my friends. there were seven of us, three guys including me and four girls. my girlfriend hannah was meant to come too but she was feeling ill. i offered to stay in with her but she insisted i go out and have a good time. 

at the club my friends got talking to a group of women who apparently work in finance. they were here for some kind of conference and were checking out the local places in their spare time. 

one of them, lauren, started trying to chat to me and ask for my number. she was pretty but i was not interested as i have a girlfriend. i told her this but she then started asking for pics of hannah. i showed her and she said that i ''could do better than that''. i was very annoyed and told her to leave me alone. 

later me and my friends were dancing, and lauren and her group came up to us and she started trying to dance with me. i gave her the brushoff once again and moved away from her and she gave me a dirty look. a while later she came back and by that point was very drunk. she smirked at me and threw her drink in my face. i was absolutely fuming and in response i poured my beer on her head. she started crying and ran to the bouncer who got us all kicked out. 

everyone then proceeded to have a go at me. i understand they were annoyed that we were kicked out, but everyone was acting like i was wrong to pour my drink on her. they all saw her splash her drink in my face, but everyone was saying it was nasty to do that to a girl. 

the ladies in our group were talking about how upset they'd be if someone ruined their dress/hair/makeup by doing that, but when i pointed out she did the same to me everyone said that it isn't the same. 

nobody said goodbye to me last night and i made my own way home. i told hannah what happened and she agrees that i didn't do anything wrong. i tried explaining myself again over the groupchat but everybody ignored me. 

how do i sort this out in a mature way?

tl;dr: my friends are acting like i was in the wrong for pouring my drink on someone who threw hers in my face.",7

"for giving my ex wife a large amount of money i won despite the anger of my gf?. i recently won a 'fuck you' amount of money. i won't say exactly how much but it's in the millions. it makes me feel funny even typing it's enough to change the life of myself and my family. 

my ex wife is the mother of my 2 kids. she is an amazing woman and good to the bone. we divorced 6 years ago because i had an affair with my current partner. i was in a low place in my life and i fucked up. she was in incredible pain but - like a fucking saint- she allowed me to still see our kids who mean the world to me, allowed our divorce to be as pain free as possible despite the fact that i know she was hurting. she still is close with my parents. she is respectful to me although she refuses to talk to my gf. 

she was actually the first person i phoned after my mom and pops after i found out i won the lottery. she was pleased for me, joked that i could take the kids on a world round trip, and that was that. nothing else. as soon as i won, i knew i wanted to give her a significant amount. i still love her. she's the mother of my babies and i feel like this is some small tiny way i can show her that i'm not a complete fuck up. she deserves to know that i care despite my mistakes. she also works a shitty job in the public library which pays her peanuts- she would actually be able to pursue her hobbies this way. give our kids a better life between us. i haven't discussed this with my ex yet, but i have with my parents who strongly agree and my lawyer who was very surprised but on board. 

long story short, when i told my gf, she was my livid. screaming that i'm disrespecting her, accusing me of still being in love with my ex wife- i'm not *in* love with her. we've both grown apart, but of course i still *love* her for being an excellent co parenting partner and mother to my kids. my gf is threatening to break up with me, and tbh i'm feeling incredibly relieved over the threats. i don't plan on changing my plans, but aita?

"for spiking my leftovers with ghost pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson. so my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. after several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. a few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. i wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing i'd eat it the next day. 

since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

i'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. after he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and i get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. i hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",3

"by letting my son take my wife's menstrual cup for show and tell. my wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. sometime over the weekend i noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. i asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it's versatility- over the next few days it helped the paw patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. it came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. i loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. 

fast forward to this morning and as we're getting ready for school alexa reminds us that it's show and tell today at school. so my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. i pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. my son looks happy so i figure he's not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he's proud of. 

our conversation:

teacher: ben's show and tell was...interesting. 

me: yea! it's cool right? we've been playing with that thing for days. 

teacher: uh, mr. scott, do you know what that is?

i start to panic- oh shit it's not a toy...

teacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. 

i get confused. 

teacher notes my confusion: it's um, used to collect menstrual blood...

i'm still confused...

teacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood

me: it just...stays in there? 

she nods. 

me: are you sure? i don't think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. 

teacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....

we're both clearly uncomfortable. 

me: alright then.....so where do i get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. 


my wife laughed hysterically when we told her. my son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.

tl:dr thought my wife's menstrual cup was a toy and my son and i played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell

edit: wow!!!! i cannot believe this got so much attention. i'm glad everyone got a good laugh. a bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn't know it was me, though. 

my wife has been reading the comments and insisted that i clarify that i know all about her cycle. we are ttc currently and, just as it was with our son, i know when she's ovulating, i track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. i grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices i was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. i was also confused by it ""fitting"" because, like i said, this device helped save a chickoletta over the weekend. i've seen a tampon- they're much slimmer than this cup is. my wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn't even feel it's presence after it's im position. 

i'd like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife's approval.",4

"8 years ago i caused a ufo panic. one college summer break 8 years ago my friends and i were bored. we remembered a demonstration from a high school science class of a ""solar balloon"". this was just a really thin black plastic bag you'd fill with air, seal, and then set out in the sun. the sun would heat the air in the black bag and the bag would become buoyant and float.  
  
we had the idea to find the cheapest/thinnest black plastic trash bags available and combine a bunch of them to make a huge balloon. we spent a few days driving around to walmarts and dollar stores trying different brands to find the thinnest possible plastic bag and thinnest tape which would work the best. finally we took a number of them, cut off the bottom ends, and taped them together into a huge balloon which we filled up with a leaf blower and then tied the end. after sitting out in the sun for a half hour or so we had done it!  
  
this is a picture a friend had taken as it was just becoming buoyant.(https://imgur.com/1kmebpm)
  
we had to mess around with how the tape was sealing the bags to use as little of it as possible as the weight of the tape added up and made the balloon harder to float.
   
shortly after this the balloon got away from us(https://imgur.com/ejipkfq)

this was dissapointing, but we made another one and got funny looks from cars driving by and were entertained for a bit. shortly after that this new balloon met it's demise smacking into a tree and getting popped. oh well, mission success.  
  
a few years later i happened across this news article(https://www.nj.com/news/local/index.ssf/2010/05/look_up_in_the_sky_its_a_large.html). the balloon that got away had apparently blown a town over and caused a big ufo panic. people were calling 911, the police, and local radio stations about it. our boredom unintentionally created a ufo panic in central nj. i moved out of the area but when i get together with my friend we always bring this up and have a good laugh.

this happened last night.

&#x200b;

this update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than i had hoped but it is what it is. i read what you all wrote and i appreciate all the comments left for me. despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that i'm not being nit picky about this issue. 

i decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. he needed help and so long as i saw that he was trying that was all i asked for. we were out to dinner (i'm sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his ""streak going."" i was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but i figured now was as good a time as any: 

me: maybe you don't have to continue to the streak. maybe you can just try new german cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

j: no way. i have people depending on me to continue this streak. i don't want to let them down.

me: i don't think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, i'm worried about you. this is really unhealthy and it's consuming your life. you're about to go on this incredible trip to germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. i think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

we had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. he doesn't think it's a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he's only 25) and how i was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. i let him know how this is my business because it affects me. we can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

we let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. the plan after was to go back to his place where i would spend the night. the entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while i wished i had just gone home. i should have gone home. i guess i didn't expect the shitstorm that waited when i got to his place.

he flipped.

he began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how i couldn't control what he did or ate. i told him i cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. i ultimately agreed that he was right, i couldn't control what he did or what he ate, but he can't expect that i stick around and watch and enable him like i had been doing in the past. 

it escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when i was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. i could not and still cannot dispute that. he was. i guess the only difference between him and i is that i wanted to change. i acknowledged the issue and knew i could not go on like this any longer. obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. one spirals much faster than the other so i was able to recognize it much quicker. 

i told him i was going to leave because i couldn't deal with this anymore. we kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would ""expose"" me. he has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. he would be sharing it on facebook. i completely panicked. i cried and begged that he didn't use my most vulnerable moments against me. he told me if i walked out he absolutely would. 

that was all i needed to hear. he was going to blackmail me. i think this snapped me awake to realize this isn't love. if i leave he's going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

so i left. i don't have many possessions there but he can keep them for all i care. he emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was ""last chance.""

let him post it. fuck it. i can't control other people i can only control myself and how i react. i deactivated all my social media and i'm ready to move on with my life. it hurts that somebody i trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it's a learning lesson. thank you all for reading.

"update: my (21m) girlfriend (21f) went on an anti semitic rant after getting into an argument with someone. i'm jewish.... op: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bc0gp4/my_21m_girlfriend_21f_went_on_an_anti_semitic/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app


i figured there was an interest in an update so here it goes. this all happened a few days ago. 

the day i made the post she actually came up to me and said that we should do something romantic for our anniversary soon. well, that didn't turn out well. 

before i told her about my background, i asked her why she holds these beliefs/attitudes towards jews. she pretty much sounded like hans landa the whole time. at one point she even admitted that she got suspended from school as a kid for ""teaming up"" with a white supremacist and pulling a horrible ""prank"" on a jewish student. 

afterwards i bluntly told her that i'm jewish. she didn't believe me at all and thought i was joking. i told her that i was dead serious and she just laughed and told me to shut up. this went on for a while and she even asked for proof. 

when it finally hit her she looked like she died inside. things went 0-100 very fast. she got physically aggressive and screamed at me, calling me a liar and a psychopath. she said that our relationship was never real because it was based on a lie and that she feels disgusted with herself. when she insulted me i reminded her that she really liked me despite my ""dirtiness"" which just pushed her over the edge. she cried hysterically and i left. 

the next morning she knocked on my door and insisted that she dumped me and not the other way around.  she warned me not tell people that i dumped her since that would make her look bad. i didn't say anything and closed the door. i heard her screaming and knocking violently, basically asking me how dare i close the door in her face and that ""you people are all the same"". after a while she left and started writing me on snapchat. i blocked her, then she called me from a friends phone and verbally attacked me. i've never seen her act so crazy. 

long story short, i blocked/deleted her on everywhere and she eventually stopped. i knew things wouldn't go smooth, especially after our initial conversation, but i didn't know it would be this bad. some of her stuff is still at my place. oh well

all of these companies are regulated — a government agency is paid by your taxes to make sure you're not ripped off. these companies also rip you off in small amounts in part because they assume you won't do anything about it. when you complain about it to the government agency that regulates them, they not only fix your problem but if enough people complain, they'll fix the whole system, which helps other people.

the types of problems could be billing (they overcharge you), service (you're not getting what you're paying for), unfair and deceptive practices (you were tricked) or more. all of these complaint systems work in 2 weeks or less and it's awesome. it's sort of crazy more people don't know about them.

whenever i start a new relationship i start putting away 50 dollars a month in a savings account. i'm a big romantic so i intend on using this money, in the event this girl is ""the one"", towards an engagement ring far down the road. subsequently, if the relationship turns goes bad and ends in a breakup, i cash out the savings and splurge on myself as part of my healing and moving on phase. is this idea brilliant or am i putting too much attention on these extremes?",7
"by matching with my homophobic uncle on grindr. so i have an uncle (we will call him j) who has always been very vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. there is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

well this weekend in between family gatherings i was looking to meet somebody . i started chatting with an older man because that's how i roll. a lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so i don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. we actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics i wish i could unsee and sending a few i wish i could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

so i'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . it is at this moment i realize my fu, i've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  he tried to play it off like a random encounter but i wasn't letting him get away with that. after some pressing he finally admits that he is the man i've been talking to and i told him i don't judge him like he does me . he apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

he kept talking with me like he was still interested and i had to make it clear that was not going to happen . i had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him i had to go ahead and block his number. i can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

always get a face pic, people.

tl:dr: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . should have insisted on the face pic

edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but i'll answer some pressing questions . i did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who i was . it is pretty disturbing to say the least. as far as blackmail goes i have everything saved but i don't plan on doing anything with it as i think that could actually put me in danger . this man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

"by getting google to ban our entire company while on the toilet. **tldr; company uses google accounts that are all connected. i fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the google account, and all associated accounts. everyone in my company is now blocked by google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

preface, this happened on friday and is still on-going. i've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so i won't be outed since i guarantee someone will read this eventually. i still do not know if i am the culprit, but i am 90% sure that i am. i feel like this is a fireable offence and i will step up and take it if it comes to that. i'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

i work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. we migrated to gmail and other google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. it's safe to say that everyone is using gmail or google in one way or another. now, our gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

i have a friend who creates android apps on the side. i do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called titanium backup. 

as a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), i buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. after that, i send him an e-mail with the cloned version through gmail with something along the lines of: ""look at this cool app i found on the store, it was completely free! try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. it was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

recently he uploaded a new app and i did the same thing as usual. i was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. i was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. i e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

about an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their google accounts. at the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

one of my colleagues requested help and i went to check it out. it turns out that their account was blocked by google due to tos violations. their google payments account was blocked as well. i thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. we got banned by google, all of us. 

the afternoon was pandemonium. we were all freaking out, our it guys were trying to get a hold of google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. we could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. all our work was shared with google services.

eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. it wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. one of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

anyways, we were all told to go home on friday. i went home and looked this up myself, and i found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the google payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. it bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how i said all our work accounts were connected?

yeah...

so it's been two days now and we've been chatting over skype, no one knows what happened and the it guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that google isn't helping us out. their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. the posts i've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

so yeah, that's that. i'm 99% sure that i am the culprit who caused this. i do not know why google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but i fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. i might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**edit1:** this blew up pretty quickly. luckily, i have 3 pms from people close to, or reps who can help me out. if i missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. i am in touch with one of them now and i am getting in touch with it at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. i will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out.

"aita for wearing the ""joke"" bikini my friend got me?. so it was my birthday couple months ago. had a party. got some gifts. my friend ""mandy"" for me a ""super cute bikini"". i liked it. said thanks. she had ripped the tags off but whatever.

haha good joke mandy. 

anyway, mandy invited me over to her place to hang out with her and her bf and a few others. most leave and we're still hanging out. i'm like hey, what if we get in your hot tub? i go change after them. and meet her bf in the hot tub she's getting new drinks. i hop in. immediately, he's looking at my chest. i pretend i don't notice and just make small talk. she comes out a few min after. and just looks in shock. eventually gets in. ""uhh is that the one i bought?"" yeah i love it. i wear it everywhere. make up some stuff about how i wore it to the beach, some party with lots of guys, etc. and she's just like ""oh"". 

we're in the tub for 20-30. eventually get out and change. she approached me after and was like. ""uhm i'm sorry thought you'd notice. but it goes kinda see thru"". i'm like yeah i know why'd you buy me a ducking see thru bathing suit? ""she's like it's a joke. wait you knew? so you just spent last 30' flashing my bf on purpose?"" i reply i'm just wearing my birthday gift from her.

"reddit has become the place where the childhood bullied become the bullies. let me explain. the reddit community is the most condescending trash i have ever seen. they constantly put others down to bolster their own insecurities, subs like r/trashy serve this exact purpose of 'we're better than them.'

now for my title, in highschools of old (maybe 5-10 years ago) nerds, geeks, and just non popular people would be bullied, most of these people now make their way onto reddit.

the majority of people here are extremely critical of intelligence to the point where it could be considered bullying. you get one thing wrong they will pounce onto you and just shut everything you have to say with 'you're not smart, remember when you said this.' one of the biggest targets is the general populace, who are heavily subject to the 'superior' redditors. this is just used to treat their insecurities in saying 'we're special and different right? we're smart' no you're not, you're literally a clone of every neckbeard redditor on the site so stfu",6

well lo and behold, they both ended up bidding on it to try to win it for a birthday present for me and they unknowingly got into a bidding war with each other!!! they ended up driving up the price by about $200 before my wife finally won the auction. they could have just bought it new in the store for $50 less then she won it for!

"update from the loser whose girlfriend's rich parents treated me like shit on christmas. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a9pkm2/i_29m_just_spent_another_awkward_holiday_with_my/)

tl;dr for my original question:  my girlfriend's ~~rich~~ asshole parents think i'm a loser. even though we're an otherwise great couple, i'm thinking about breaking up because i don't think she's willing to risk her financial security to stand up to them, and i can't see this relationship going anywhere if she doesn't.

i posted a few days ago on a throwaway account thinking it probably wouldn't go anywhere but hoping a few more experienced internet strangers might give me some insight. it got some attention and there was some solid advice (thanks u/iamseriouslyaperson!) and a lot of perspective on the whole situation and i was like, ""okay, that was enlightening,"" and went on with my day. gf was working that night so there wasn't much to do with all that info at the time, and i fell asleep while attempting to formulate my side of the big talk.

little did i know that post blew up overnight and made the front page and gf saw it. i didn't give any names/locations, but there was enough specific information that she had no trouble figuring out it was me. so thursday, while at work and still unaware of all this, i got a dreaded ""we need to talk"" text. yep, all caps. and i was like ""welp, i'm dead.""

she was feeling hurt and angry when she sent that text but she said she had time to read through some of the comments and think about things and she wasn't as upset when she came to my apartment later (she brought food). still, she said i had no right to tell the whole internet about our relationship problems, and i agreed/apologized. she knows i'm writing this update and she's going to read it before i post, the reason for that being she admitted the internet actually made some good points regarding our relationship problems.

we talked for a long time thursday night. she said she knows her parents treat people like shit and that they control her and her siblings with money. it's partially a cultural thing, according to her. gf was born and raised in the u.s. but her parents grew up rich in a different country and moved here a long time ago. she said they had a hard time assimilating with upper-class americans and flaunt their wealth because they're socially insecure. gf also implied that kind behavior was a lot more acceptable in their home country in the 1980s and they never changed. she grew up seeing them act that way and, at least when she was younger, thought it was normal.

on top of that, gf's mom was/is emotionally and physically abusive. she said her mom used to slap her for ""talking back"" and once cut up all of gf's clothes and bedding after an argument over her going out with some high school friends. gf said she's still afraid of her mom and has a hard time standing up to her. she also got very little affection from her parents growing up. it seems like that was all replaced with material things. so, to her, being cut off from her family financially is the same as being cut off emotionally.

all that being said, gf doesn't expect me to visit her parents again. she was very apologetic about how they treated me and also about not calling them out. she was really hurt that i said i thought i was ""wasting my time"" in the earlier post and i said i was sorry, and i am. i was still raging a little when i wrote that. i asked her about maybe letting her parents cut her off financially and living on her own. it wouldn't mean she has to go no contact but their relationship would be based on something other than money.

we've been talking about moving in together for a while now and she actually suggested she move out of her townhouse (that her family pays for) and into my apartment. i'm totally fine this. we've been together for almost 3 years and i think we would have moved in together a while ago if her parents weren't so against it. she's really nervous about being on her own financially but she's willing to try it. we spent hours yesterday going through her finances and coming up with a budget. it's going to be a big change in how she lives and thinks about things. i'm managing my expectations as far as spending is concerned. no one can change their habits overnight.

we're not combining our finances or putting her name on the lease. the plan for now is to split the cost of rent and utilities and she asked me to put her on an allowance for spending her own money. she also gave me the credit cards her parents pay for and told me to hide them. it's weird to me to have this much control over another person's finances. we're going to give it until my lease is up in march (my apartment is a little small for both of us and all our stuff) and then, assuming all this works out, we'll look for a place to officially live together. she isn't going to tell her parents right away but she promised she will before march.

tl:dr: thanks, reddit, for telling me to grow some balls and talk to my gf about her family situation. i did and i think things are going to get better.

edit

to everyone who's wondering, her parents are from mexico.

gf has a job and her own income. she is the co-owner of a business and makes a decent living on her own, just not nearly enough to fund the kind of lifestyle she's used to.

also, before you say ""she shouldn't have been mad that he posted about their relationship on reddit,"" please for one second put yourself in that situation. you're casually browsing the front page and find a post about your personal life that was obviously written by your boyfriend and makes you sound like a complete piece of shit. in that same post, your boyfriend says he's thinking about breaking up with you. that's now just out there for the whole world to read. you can't say that wouldn't be alarming. she said ""it felt like a slap in the face,"" which made me feel pretty shitty for posting it at all. all things considered, i think she was pretty reasonable about it. ultimately, she was cool about me posting the update, and actually wanted to make sure i thanked reddit for the perspective. no, she is not ""demanding"" to ""approve"" this update. she's just involved now, as she should be since she's half of this relationship.",7
"update mn school is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. i'm now suspended and they want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.. i'm updating my last post(https://redd.it/764vzw) here.

i did what you all told me to do. i wrote a letter, had my mom sign it and sent it to the superintendent's office. i also called them. they said they will speak with the school.

i was called into school and the principal's office and was told to take the test there in his presence. i did that, the math teacher came and looked through all my answers and said it's another perfect score and wanted to leave.

i said loudly ""i think you owe me an apology.""

she said ""yes, i should not have accused you of cheating.""

i said ""yes, and another apology for saying i don't have the mental faculties to get a perfect score.""

she said ""i'm sorry"" and left.

the principal said ""don't push your luck kid.""

i said ""it wasn't luck, and you also owe me an apology.""

he apologized and said my suspension is reversed and it won't go in my records. i then went to the counselor and told him that now in his 24 years, there is one student who was accused of cheating and proved the teacher and administrators wrong, so he shouldn't give bad advice to the next poor student who is in my place.

so things are sorted out now. but also, i'm not going to be arrogant or aggressive like that with people. i only spoke like that with them because they have said incredibly mean and insulting things to me and i was very pissed off at them. and the counselor had given me horrible advice.

thanks for pointing me in the right direction!",2

"update. my parents joined a new age cult and tried to drag me to a compound against my will.. since my last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ccd4vh/fl_my_parents_have_joined_some_new_age_religion/) got popular and people still seem interested in my situation i thought i would give you guys a update on everything. it's been over a month and i'm sorry i kept you guys waiting. things were pretty crazy and my therapist said it probably wasn't the best idea to rant about it online till i felt ready. well, now that i'm settled down a bit i feel like it might be good to get this off my chest anyway. sorry if this disappoints you guys though as my dad says i should not include any personal details for fear of leaking my identity (so even though i know the group now i won't be naming them for fear of it getting back to me).

&#x200b;

so after i stayed the night with my friends family my mom and step dad tried to get me to come back home immediately. my dad said not to go so i somehow convinced my mom to let me stay the rest of this day and i would come home that night. this plan didn't work out very well though as my sisters dad called the police to report that he couldn't contact my sister and was afraid she was kidnapped. it didn't take long before my mom caught on that i was the one who leaked to him their plans and they freaked out.  my mom then came to my friends house and tried to force her way in to take me because i had been ""corrupted"" and needed to be locked away from bad influences till we left for the compound. my friends parents called the police and i called my dad and he got to talk to my mom. i'll leave it short and say this was a nightmare situation that almost ended with my mom being charged with  trespassing.

&#x200b;

my mom and dad argued on the phone for over 3 hours outside of my friends house. in the end my dad made it so i would not have to go with them but the only ""safe"" place my mom would agree to me staying is with my uncle 4 hours away. i stayed with him for over a week and it was the worst week of my life. my mom called me constantly to try to talk to me and ""save me from the evil energies my father had possessed me with.: my step father also began to send me various threats and told me that at the end of the month i was coming no matter what. 

&#x200b;

after a week of this, everything changed. my mom stopped calling me, my stepdad stopped texting and they went quiet for 4  days. me, my uncle, my dad, all of them couldn't reach them. my sisters dad also stopped being able to reach them. during this time my mom bought my sister a plane ticket home and my sisters dad only learned of this when he got a call after my parents dropped my sister off at the airport.  after this my mom called me one last time.

&#x200b;

she proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". all to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand i was being used by evil.""during these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn i was."" according to her i am a ""evil seed"" and that i not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". i also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. she told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. she ended by telling me that i was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". the last contact i know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

&#x200b;

at the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. i moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. things are still pretty raw right now and i really don't feel like getting into the emotions i feel towards this. but i feel like at least updating this may be a start. thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. i really do appreciate it :)",2

"when i nannied i would read the journal of the mom.. i was only 20 years old and i nannied for this little baby boy. the mom seemed off. she would sleep the entire time i was there in the mornings , or go on three hour runs, or sometimes would just go about her business around the house- completely ignoring me. one time we both sat in the living room while the baby was sleeping in his room- i was reading a book (studying) and she sat there eating mcdonald's and watching her show. she did not say a word to me the entire time. 

well, one day when she was out i snooped around and found her journal- i read the whole thing. then got sad for her- she was so unhappy in her marriage and in life.

i ended up working for her for three years and we became close. but that first year was so uncomfortable and awkward. in retrospect, it seems very obvious that she was suffering from post pregnancy depression.

"hey assholes, you're doing it wrong.. since we just blew past 800,000 subscribers, it occurs to me that a half million of you may have arrived here since the last time i ranted about voting on this sub. so, if you just got here from the front page or subscribed in the last month, first of all: welcome to the sub! second of all, cut your shit out, you're ruining our nice little discussion.

you may not need to hear this, but a whole lot of people evidently do, so here are a couple of guidelines for how to vote like an adult:

* **upvote real dilemmas**. if you see a post where you actually have trouble deciding whether the op is an asshole or not, **upvote it**, because that's an interesting post!!
* **upvote assholes who aren't trolling**. if you see a post where you think the op is an asshole, but you doubt that he realizes he did anything wrong, **upvote it** and grab your popcorn, because this is going to be fun!
* **stop rewarding validation posts**. upvotes are not a political statement. they aren't something you give because the op is really nice. every time people upvote a boring, obvious post because the op is admirable and blameless, they aren't rewarding the op, they're ruining the sub. if you want to tell op they're great, write an nta comment and praise them all you want. don't ruin our front page because you want to reward someone who gave 1,000 free meals to starving kids but still wants to know if they're the asshole because kid number 789 didn't like taste of his quinoa. give them gold, and stay the hell away from the orange arrow.

as you can see, stupid voting makes mods angry. judging by the amount of whining we catch when an obvious validation post gets 5k upvotes, it makes subscribers angry too. what makes everyone happy is using your upvote to promote content *that belongs here and that other people will be interested in*. this is how upvotes work everywhere on reddit, but surprisingly, no one seems to accept this. please be the better person and vote correctly here. interesting content depends on it!  (if you think a post breaks a rule or is too low value to tolerate, reporting is always an option.)

also important: in the comments, show a little backbone. **don't downvote everyone you disagree with.** if you say the post is nta, and someone else says it's esh, you're both contributing, and you're both making the discussion interesting. if you downvote whoever you disagree with, you take a conversation that might have been an interesting interaction, and push it one step closer to being a meaningless echo chamber. there are plenty of places to go and circle-jerk with people who already think the same way you do; if that's what you want, please go there. the whole idea of this sub is to consider everyone else's opinion, not just reinforce your own. if you can't handle seeing an idea you don't agree with getting a little attention, please unsubscribe and gtfo. you have come to the wrong place.

p.s. if you have read this far and not unsubscribed, thank you. maybe you're not an asshole after all.

back in november 2018 i was arrested at work in front of my boss and co-workers. it was the most humiliating thing i've ever experienced. i later learned at the police station that i was being charged with multiple felonies. this came as a huge surprise. luckily i was able to keep my wits and lawyer up instead of speaking with the detective. for $13,000 which completely wiped my savings, i was able to retain a criminal defense attorney. however it cost me everything and i was unable to pay my bond. this resulted in me staying in jail for a total of 54 days. at a status hearing, my attorney presented video evidence of me gassing up my car 3 hours away from where the crimes took place and i ended up having all my charges dismissed. when i finally got out i learned that i had lost my job, was in the process of being evicted, and my son was in the state's care. his mother is a heroine addict and i haven't spoken to my own parents in nearly 15 years. they wouldn't let him go to my girlfriend because they didn't consider her family.

&#x200b;

since my release, i've learned that i can't sue the police and no one gives a shit that i was locked up for 54 days because the detective did poor investigation work. i've gone to the local press about this and was told that what happened to me happens quite a bit. they took down my info but never followed up. so what i did was create a website sharing my story. i also uploaded the police report and some other documents from the discovery. literally the only reason why i was arrested was because an eye witness said they saw me. if the detective had done his job, he could have verified that i wasn't even in town on the day the crimes took place. this is what pisses me off the most. my life was ruined because of a lazy employee.

&#x200b;

i'm writing this now because my website is now ranked #2 on the first page of search results when you type in my town's name. i live in a touristy town and we attract a lot of visitors over the summer. my web traffic has more than quadrupled, and apparently it's gotten someone high up's attention. i received a cease and desist letter recently, which i showed to my attorney. he said sharing my experience online isn't illegal and that everything i had stated was a fact or my own opinion, protecting me from a defamation lawsuit. yesterday i received a visit from two officers and the detective who had arrested me. he apologized, stating ""mistakes can happen."" they then talked to me about my website and asked if i could remove it. i said i would delete it on the condition that the detective leave his job and never do police work again. suffice to say that isn't happening.

&#x200b;

after the visit i received, i'm more pissed off that the only reason the detective apologized to me was to get me to take down my website. i don't plan to and the only one supporting this is my girlfriend. my friends think i'm being spiteful and have suggested that i just delete it. for keeping my website up?

hey guys. i first just want to thank you all for all the support regarding my last post.

i've had a free consultation with a personal injury lawyer and have filed a police report like many of you suggested. i let my cousin and aunt and uncle know this and they immediately ended up offering to pay my hospital bill (and ambulance ride) in full.

my cousin gave me a half-hearted apology and his parents told me he won't be leaving the house for the next year and will be severely punished for this.

i've decided not to press charges, i don't really have the money/time for it, and all i needed was my medical expenses paid. i just plan on not going to any family gatherings where he is for a long long long time.

thanks again for all the love and support.

"i lied to my best friend to get off the phone not knowing he was writing his suicide note and just wanted one last chat.. one day after school i was with a few friends and we were all smoking, at some point during the session i got a call from my best friend who sounded a bit out of it and didn't really seem like he had any other intention than to just have a conversation. we spoke for about 2 minutes and then it was my turn in the circle so i told my friend that my phone was about to die so i was going to have to get back to him. 

the next day i awoke to multiple missed calls from his mother, i called her immediately and she told me that he had hanged himself and that he was in a coma. i would then go on to spend 4 days in a hospital by his side for the most part, on the fourth day they turned his life support off. 

during all of this i checked his phone as i was the only person who knew his passcode and i found a suicide note, the timestamp was around the time that he had called me the day before. i'm not sure if i will ever get over the fact that i gave up my last conversation ever with the greatest person i've ever known for a bong.

"i'm the guy stealing your ashtray off your porch every couple nights.. throwaway because a lot of people know my real reddit.

for the past 3 months i have hit a rough patch. barely making my rent which is $480 a week, barely making my bills. can barely afford cigarettes. (cigarettes in australia cost roughly $25 for a pack of 20's)

a neighbour of mine is an outdoor smoker, he lives in an apartment building just a block away. he has been filling large jars up with his cigarette butts and keeping them in the jar at his front door, the first time i stole it the next day he had already put out an identical jar, i let that fill up for a few days and then i stole that one too. this repeated two more times.

the fifth jar he put out, funny enough literally the next day. was also identical except this one had the message ""please bring back jar :)"" a lot of people would be disgusted that someone is stealing their ashtray but whoever lives in this house obviously knows what it means to be broke.

i listened to whoever it was and after i stole the ashtray with the message on it, i grabbed all the jars i had from my his house and brought them back to his doorstep. ever since then, he has been leaving me half cigarettes in the ashtray, our routine is, he smokes, fills it up, i take it home, and bring back the jar i had taken recently.

it's literally now a whole system.... two jars constantly in rotation between us both. and we have never even met each other, or seen each other before.

tl;dr: starting stealing ashtrays off my neighbour, now we have a whole system together where he supplies half cigarettes for me every couple days.

"by not taking off my apple watch or disabling the 911 feature and accidentally called police while i was handcuffed and being spanked by my husband and the police heard me screaming.. to begin, i'm a female bdsm practitioner. i enjoy it, and i won't apologize. (edit: that came out harsh. i'm sorry)

my husband often cuffs and whips me, and on wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. he put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my apple watch. i didn't realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. 

so we get into it, and he's spanking me and i'm pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly i hear from my watch ""ma'am, i hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. we are sending someone to you. hold tight."" 

""did you call 911???"" my husband asked, ""tell them it was an accident!!""

so i tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name she said my name here? and i say yes... and she says ""we have your address from our database, and we're sending someone over now. im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you're safe.

i said okay thank you, and i hung up.

""the police are coming.""

shit. i'm literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. within a few minutes there's a stern knock at the door. we put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.

i calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. i didn't mention the spanking.

apparently my husband did. another police officer comes in and asks about our bdsm contract. ""he told you about our contract?""

""he felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show state of mind.""

i go get our contract and showed it to the officers. after a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the apple watch if we're going to do that again.

tl;dr by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy bdsm session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.

"""ok boomer"" is a completely reasonable and well-deserved response from millennials and younger generations due to the mess that the previous generations left us to deal with and their refusal to take responsibility for their actions.. facts:

•	millennials earn 20% less than baby boomers did—despite being better educated 
( https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/millennials-earn-20-percent-less-than-boomersdespite-being-better-educated.html )

•	cost of college has gone up at 8 times the rate of wages 
( https://www.forbes.com/sites/camilomaldonado/2018/07/24/price-of-college-increasing-almost-8-times-faster-than-wages/#6ba328a466c1 )

•	there is not one single state in the united states where a full-time, just-above-minimum-wage job can support a 1 bedroom apartment 
( https://www.businessinsider.com/minimum-wage-worker-cant-afford-one-bedroom-rent-us-2018-6 ). 

•	student loans now make up the largest chunk of non-housing debt in america, and many ""entry level"" jobs now require a degree.
( https://www.finder.com/student-loans-account-for-36-35-of-non-housing-debt )

•	cost of living is up 300% or more since the 1970s but wages are only up 50-70%. 


for example, the bureau of census reports that the average price of a new home in june 1998 was $175,900.

according to inflation, that price today should be $271,931. the same report places the average sale price for june 2018 at $368,500, however, more than 35% higher than the price when accounting for inflation alone. 

a gallon of gas in 1994 cost $1.06, making it $1.64 in june 2014, when adjusted for inflation. the actual national average price, as of july 2018, is $2.88 – 75% higher than what it would be if inflation were the only cause for the increase.

the median household income in 1998 was $38,885. the most recent year with full data available is 2017, so adjusting for inflation as of that year gives a median income of $58,487. the bureau of census reports that the actual median 2017 income was $59,000 – higher than the adjusted figure, but not by very much, and certainly nowhere near the percentage that prices have outpaced inflation.

this did not happen by accident - this happened because of greed. ceo salary and shareholder profits have outstripped wages and cost of living by a factor of between 3 and 8 depending on the source you read. 

millennials truly have it harder than our parents did.

•	we cannot afford to ""put ourselves through school"" working a part time job - they could. 

•	we cannot afford to have one parent stay at home - they could. 

•	we cannot afford to buy a house on a single income - they could. 

and yet, boomers have the audacity to tell us that we need to just work harder, pull ourselves up by our boot straps. that we're lazy and entitled. 

no, we're not. the data shows that millennials work just as hard as our parents generation, but we struggle more. 

for years now, when boomers have told us, ""you're lazy and entitled"" and we need to ""just work harder"", we've tried to explain this to them - and they don't listen. 

we learned that there's no point in trying to convince them - nothing will change their mind. so now we just say, ""ok boomer"".

"if you start suddenly getting email/spam ""bombed"" there's probably a reason. i'm not 100% sure how well this fits here (it is financial), but i wanted to warn as many people as possible.

last week on tuesday morning i was sitting at my desk and suddenly started getting emails. lots, and lots, and lots of them. 30-40 every minute. they were clearly spam. many of them had russian or chinese words, but random.

i called one of our it guys and he confirmed it was just me. and the traffic was putting a strain on our mail server so they disabled my account. by that point i have over 700 emails in my inbox. they were bypassing the spam filter (more on that later). after a different situation that happened  a few months ago, i've learned that things like this aren't random.

so i googled ""suddenly getting lots of spam"". turns out, scammers do this to bury legitimate emails from you, most often to hide purchases. i started going through the 700+ emails one by one until i found an email from amazon.com(https://amazon.com) confirming my purchase of 5 pc graphics cards (over $1000).

i logged into my amazon account, but didn't see an order. then i checked - sure enough those cheeky bastards had archived the order too. i immediately changed my password and called amazon..

i still haven't heard from their security team how the breach happened (if they got into my amazon account by password, or did a ""one time login"" through my email.) the spam made it through our spam filter because the way this spam bomb was conducted, they use bots to go out to ""legitimate"" websites and sign your email up for subscription etc. so then i'd get an email from a random russian travel site, and our filters let it through.

either way - we got the order cancelled before it shipped, and my email is back to normal - albeit different passwords.

and i honestly thought about shipping a box of dog crap to that address (probably a vacant house) but i decided against mailing bio-hazardous waste.

either way - if you see something suspicious - investigate!

"i stole $40 from my mom to buy a can of pringles. back in grade school when i was about 10 i stole $40 from my mothers purse to use whenever i wanted to buy something. once i got to school that day though i saw one of the other kids had a can of dill pickle pringles which are still my absolute favorite to this day. so my stupid 10year old self gave him all $40 for that single and enjoyed every single of those delicious fuckers. 

when i came to school the next day though the same kid i bought the pringles from, gave me back the $40 while crying because apparently his mom screamed at him to give it back and now he couldn't buy candy with it because his mom wouldn't let him keep it. i held on to that money for a couple days until my mom started looking around and asking if i had seen the money laying around since it wasn't in her purse, so once i realized how i'd get my ass beat if she found out i hid it under the couch and 'found' it about 30 minutes later. i never got caught but still look back on it and laugh that i essentially got some pringles for free from the whole ordeal.",11
"i conspired with our local brewpub to stop selling my husband growlers of ipa because the beer made him smell so bad.. i may get downvoted for this but here goes. my husband loves ipa beer but it makes him smell so bad it's not even funny. it just reeks out his pores and will actually make our sheets and his pillow case smell bad. it also really doesn't matter what brand or how high quality it is, whatever is in ipa doesn't mix with his body chemistry. 

his favorite beer by far is from a local brewpub. i'd say he was drinking about 2/3 growlers of their ipa a week. i finally couldn't take it anymore so one day at lunch i went in and asked to speak with the owner. he is a very super cool guy and he said that he also can't stand ipas because it's the reason so many bad breweries have been able to open because ipas take very little skill to make and people often cover up mistakes with the intense flavors. so he and i worked out a deal that any time my husband came in, he and is workers would tell him they were out of ipa but they would offer him a more traditional lager at a discount. our hope was that eventually he'd lose the taste for ipa and stop stinking up our house. i even offered to work out a deal with the owner that i pay him whatever he was losing in the discount and he told me not to worry about it. 

so it's actually worked. i've tricked my husband's taste buds into liking lighter beer and he seems to be past the disgusting ipa stage and he smells way better.

"by living in a dark bedroom for 6 years.. the overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. 

6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. i bought a replacement bulb but when i put that one in it was also barely lighting up so i realized the unit was bad.  

the fan still worked great, it literally is the best fan i've ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. the fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so i didn't really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn't get much natural light so it is pretty dark. 


so since then over the years my wife and i have had to make due with no overhead light. we open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. it's never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so i keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. 

after 6 years of living in the dark, this winter i just decided i would replace the damn thing. but before i did, i decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it's possible both bulbs i had tried were bad. 

so i'm up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as i'm turning the light on i realize:

the goddamn thing is dimmable. 


for 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to ""dim"". 

fuck me.

for 6 years i lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time. ",4

usually on dates, we split the bill. i don't really care like in the past, i've paid for the full bill and my ex would pay for the bill other times. like we'd go back and forth. 

my current boyfriend wants us to each pay for what we ordered. from the first date, he said that's how he likes to do things. i was fine with it, i didn't  really care if he wouldn't pay for me. paying on a date is sweet to me and i like it but i have my own job so it's whatever. i figured maybe he doesn't have a ton of money and he can only cover his own bill. 

anyway i didn't really have any problem with it. but we went out to some random spot. like a local chipotle, it tastes way better though. so he went down the line and he got his own meal. i ordered mine and then when i went into my bag, i realized i forgot my wallet at my house. i told him that i forgot it by accident and i thought he'd offer to pay and id pay him back but he was like ""oh that sucks..."" and sat down to eat. 

i was just like what the fuck..? this guy standing behind me in the line paid for my food and i paid him back through cashapp. after we ate, i lied and said my mom needed me to come home for something and our date was cut short since we were supposed to go shopping in the city.

it happened again around a week later: i was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. this time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. i called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  i went across the street and knocked on his door. he didn't answer. we set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and i kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so i could talk to him.

&#x200b;

i reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. why our yard? no clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. the next time i saw him walking to his car, i confronted him. i simply told him that i knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if i caught him doing it again i'd call the police to report him for trespassing. he denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200b;

so i review the footage from the last few days. dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. he then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. what the absolute fuck.

"update: for continuing to call my teacher by her first name when she refers to me by my last?. this is the original post: /r/amitheasshole/comments/dcvwmo/aita_for_continuing_to_call_my_teacher_by_her/

i first want to thank everybody who commented on my post. it honestly helped me so much and without it i don't know if i'd end up in this position.

so i went up to my parents and asked them for the millionth time if they could come with me to talk to my principal. they of course said no. i'm kind of ashamed to say this but some tears were shed when they said this. afterwards my dad came up to me and told me that he'd come to me if it meant so much. however he told me to go up to my teacher just one last time and if it didn't work he'd definitely accompany me to the principals office.

so i went to my teacher. i already knew how everything was going to go out so i didn't have any hope. i told her that i don't appreciate her making fun of my name and if she continues i would continue to call her by her first name ( minus the mrs.). she told me that i was a very disrespectful child and that she could do whatever she wanted and that she was fair. i told her that many people don't think she's fair and in return she just looked confused. i handed her my phone with reddit on it and had her read the comments ( luckily she's my english teacher). her face went from nothing to just sadness. i swear it was so weird. it's like a realization hit her because she just changed everything.

she apologized to me and told me that my name for her was associated with someone else in her life who affected her a lot. and saying my name just gets her bad memories i guess? she told me that she was caught up and just kept apologizing. at this point i kinda felt guilty because i never took this thought into consideration.

she told me she'd try to say my name ( and won't cross it out of tests anymore) but it might take time, and that in the meantime i can still call her by her first name. ( all my classmates are jealous because i'm the only person allowed lol)

we've talked about the past detentions she's given me and she said she'll talk to the principal about it and will try to get them removed.

honestly this isn't how i thought things were going to turn out. and i'm pretty sure you guys wanted some epic revenge like her getting fired or something, but all we have is a happy ending.",3
"my brother beat me up so i ruined his relationship. no regrets

my brother and i have a very bad relationship, there's a lot of yelling and cussing but we never got phisycal until one night he came home very angry and just started punching and kicking me. our parents weren't home so i guess that's why he felt brave. i ended up with a busted lip, a black eye and a bunch of bruises all over my body. after that our father sent him away for a while. a few days later i used my mom's phone to ""accidentally"" call his girlfriend and left it on while i talked to my mom how worried i was that he was capable to beat up his little sister, imagine what he could do to his girlfriend.

the next day the girl showed up at our house saying that she wanted to hang out with the family, which was really weird because she would only do that when my brother was at home.  but when she saw me she started freaking out asking what had happened and if it had anything to do with my brother. my mom ended up telling her and she dumped him the same day.

"for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.. i'm(22m) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. we're very close and we have always been like that. he lives with me now obviously. he often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so i comfort him as best as i can. 

so, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. she doesn't live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn't wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. she woke us up and made a scene in front of him. she said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it's extremely concerning that he's so affectionate towards me. my brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. i brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

i went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. i told her to get the fuck out. she got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. i grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. i didn't hurt her, she was following me, i didn't use any force. she left, she called me few times but i didn't answer.


update: thanks for all the comments. i talked to her, she still said that she didn't do anything wrong,she didn't hurt my brother and it wasn't her fault that he started crying. i broke up with her.

"when i was a server i threw a customers phone into a trash compactor. i had just started serving tables at a restaurant,  and i was working my first super busy brunch shift. i had 6+ tables and i'm not gonna lie, i had a tough time running all the mimosas that my tables were ordering. i could tell that one table of all women were getting abnormally angry about their drinks taking a while. i apologized for the delay and made a joke about it being an especially busy shift. i offered them a round of drinks on me to smooth the situation over. when i walked away, one lady murmured under her breath that i was an ""incompetent cunt"". 

let's stop there, its common for people to treat servers like shit, but this was the first time i ever had experienced being spoken to like i was garbage. i shook it off and continued to be nice to them, but it only got worse from there. they started to laugh at me, and shit talk me to one another. they told me that my future career looked pretty bleak, considering i couldn't even serve tables, ""honey, even a toddler can deliver drinks"". when i took their order for food, one woman refused to speak to me. she just stared at me while her friend ordered for her. by now i am pissed. i asked her why she felt the need to have her friend order for her? she laughed in my face, looked down at the menu, and said because i was a dumb little bitch. 

due to the fact i was at work, i couldn't argue or tell her to eat shit for treating me like i was a dog, if i did my boss would have fired me. they ended up stiffing me on their 200 dollar check. once they left, i realized the woman that gave me so much shit had left her phone. i took it and went out the back door to smoke a cigarette and try to calm down, who the hell did that women think she is? so i promptly turned off her phone, threw it in the trash compactor, and turned it on. she came back minutes later and asked multiple staff members if we found it, i told her that i didn't see it when i bussed the table, and that i would call her if it turned up. i never told anyone but i never regretted doing it. when you treat people like shit, expect shitty things to happen to you


edit #1. thanks for my first ever metal kind stranger! 

edit #2. i should have clarified that they stiffed me, as in they didn't tip me. they did pay their bill before they bounced

lastly, i've been in the service industry for a hot minute and i've only experienced this level of disrespect twice. whether you believe it or not, some people actually think they have the right to talk to servers like this and many restaurants dgaf",11

&#x200b;

so i want to start out by saying that i was wrong and i want to apologize to anyone i may have hurt with my last question. it was wrong of me to defend my brothers actions and i wish i could have seen that at the time but thats the past.

i went to my parents and talked to them and they have begun to see that they were wrong too. me and my dad went last night and apologized to the shop owner for our actions and how we treated him and the victim of my brother and that we agree with his ban. the owner was genuinely happy with us for this so i'm glad we did that. the girl who who my brother touched was also at the store and despite what many of you said i felt that i needed to apologize to her too because she deserved it after my actions and she thanked me for it. my parents are now looking into different options to deal with my brother including therapy and other programs. 

&#x200b;

i really want to end this by saying thank you for helping me learn i was wrong. like i said i'm sorry if i hurt anyone with my post, i didn't mean to do that but it was wrong of me too. this has been a learning experience for me and i hope that i can become a better person because of it.",2

--------------

i apologize if this is not an appropriate sub to ask. i posted this on  r/relationships but it was locked, and the mod suggested i ask on r/parenting. but i also want relationship advice on how to deal with my wife, so i want to ask for advice here, too.

--------------------

first of all, i'm sorry if this ends up being long and rambly, i am not really in the best state of mind. my world has been turned upside down over the last couple of weeks. i just want to write as much context as possible so i can get the best advice needed. for obvious reasons, i am not yet comfortable talking about this with my friends/parents/siblings.

---------------------

background: i met my wife when we were in highschool and we married in college. we have 5 beautiful children together - really, i consider them a total blessing regardless of what i'm about to bring up - and up until a couple of weeks ago i thought that we had the perfect marriage. we were typical highschool sweet hearts, we go out together, we never fight, i feel like i've done everything a loving husband should do. i am saying this not to make myself out as the perfect husband, for example my work has always meant i work long hours and maybe haven't always been there when she needed me, but i want to stress that i've never felt our marriage was in any trouble. and never in a million years would i ever have suspected my wife of being disloyal - she's always done everything she could to support me and take care of our children.

now, my eldest daughter recently had an ancestry test done. and the results of the ancestry test strongly suggested i was not her father. she confided this to me privately, showing me the results and i could tell she was visibly upset by this. of course, the first thing i did was reassure her that no matter what, she's my daughter and i'll always love her unconditionally. but secondly, the two of us decided to get an official paternity test since the ancestry tests are not completely reliable. it comes back and i am indeed not her biological father.

this news really broke me. i'm ashamed to say i broke down in tears in front of my daughter. the combination of finding out about my wife's infidelity and how upset i was making my daughter by how i was reacting. i really wish i had kept it in for her sake, but i didn't.

following this i asked my other children, except my youngest, to come and see me. i wanted to know the extent of my wife's infidelity - if it was a one off, i could maybe work past it, especially given how long ago it would be. however i didn't want to tell my youngest as she is still in school, a teenager, and really i didn't think it was appropriate to tell her yet.

we tell the other three what has happened, i reassure them that i love them unconditionally and that i'll always be there dad, but that i need to know how long this has been going on. god, i can't begin to explain how touching their reaction was. they didn't care i wasn't their biological father, they were just upset at how heart broken i was. i feel like the only thing that has kept me going these last couple of weeks is their unwavering support.

so we have paternity tests for each of the three done. not only are none of them my biological children, together four of my children have three different fathers. which somehow made it worse. it's like, she wasn't just having an ongoing affair, she was having multiple? i can't explain how this make it worse, but it just does.

so i confront my wife with this, expecting her to confess and beg for forgiveness. she doesn't confess. she doesn't even take it seriously. she says the tests must be flawed. all four? how the hell am i supposed to take that seriously?

i keep bringing it up and she keeps brushing it off, getting progressively more annoyed at me. when i bring it up she will try and guilt trip me. ""we've been together since highschool, do you seriously not trust me?"" etc. but how am i supposed to trust her in the face of such overwhelming evidence?

now that i have rambled and explained what has happened. i guess let me ask a few direct questions for advice

1. how can i reassure my children this doesn't change anything between us? i feel like the way i have reacted, total break downs, has made them second guess this despite however many times i reassure them.

2. how do i handle my youngest daughter? i feel like our marriage is beyond saving, and i will need to tell my daughter something. i don't want her to know the truth until she's older, but i also don't want my wife lying and making me out to be the villain.

3. is there anyway, anyway at all, you think i could or should save my marriage? i've been with my wife my entire life it's almost impossible to see a life without her. i know that the answer should be a clear cut ""leave her"", but we have 5 kids together. if there's anything that can be done to save our marriage, i want to consider it seriously.

tl;dr: found out at least 4 of my 5 kids are not mine. wife refuses to confess her infidelity. unsure of how to do what's best for my children and marriage.

--------------------------

edit: thanks so much to everyone for all the support and advice. i have not replied to as many comments as i should have, but i've read each and every one and taken your advice to heart. i'll continue reading any comments or messages you send me. again, i can't begin to thank you for all your support. if this is resolved i might post an update, but if she continues to lie then i don't think i'll bother, as there's not much more i can add. from the advice in this and the r/parenting thread i've decided to:

1. get second tests just in case some freak accident has occurred.

2. confront my wife with all four of my older children present.

3. tell my youngest of the situation. ask her if she wants to have a paternity test. it will be entirely her decision.

4. i'm 100% going to get some form of therapy. my mental state has really been deteriorating over the last couple of weeks, and i owe it to my kids to hold it to together.

5. depending on whether my wife tells the truth, and what her explanation is (if any), i have not ruled out some form of counselling. but at the moment i think divorce is inevitable unless she changes her attitude drastically.

6. contact a lawyer and prepare for divorce, if it comes to that

once again i'd like to thank all of you for the time you took to express your support and share advice.

--------------------

edit2: i guess i should clarify some things that people have been asking

1. **how did the ancestry results suggests i wasn't her father?** my family is entirely irish. no relatives outside of ireland other than my immediate family, and i even have the stereotypical red hair. my daughter's ancestry results showed nothing from the british isles/western europe/northern europe. that's what set off alarm bells, but it's by no means conclusive, hence the paternity tests.

2. **which two children share the same father?** my two eldest daughters share the same father.

3. **how did your wife conceive your children?** our eldest daughter was not planned. all the others were planned. each time we conceived several months after we started trying. our first three planned children were both our ideas, while she pressured me into having our youngest. she was in her late thirties and wanted one last child before it was too late, and eventually i agreed. she was conceived several months after we started trying, too.

4. **are you infertile?** i don't know. i've never had a fertility test done. but the fact that none of our planned children are mine makes me think that i might be. i will have a  fertility test as soon as possible.

"once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam.. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... 

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note.  people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  words cannot do justice to the experience.  the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday.  all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note.  from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted!  the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  soon the entire monastery was aflame.  by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

i watched the vhs tape and it was of my uncle going on a 25 minute speech about government conspiracies and how banks cannot be trusted. that's why he kept his savings in cash. he didn't even trust a safe deposit box. that's why they were kept in his walls. and it was $120,000 as he said it in the video. i found the other $20,000.

i went to a lawyer and showed her the will, the video and she said  it's surprisingly common for people to leave cash inheritances in our area. she talked to the executor of the will as well, and then wrote a letter for me to give to the bank which explained this is from a cash inheritance with contact details of the executor in case the bank needed to contact them.

i scheduled an appointment with the bank. when i told them it's for a cash deposit they told me i don't need an appointment for that but i told them it's for a large deposit. they still said no appointment is necessary, but then i said it's a very large deposit. so they booked the appointment. everything went smoothly at the bank. they made a copy of the letter that my lawyer had prepared. money was in my account a few hours later.

**we noticed massive increases in time until top comment**

> before, the top comment was posted within the first 4.47 minutes average. 

> with the 30-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 6.82 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). (around 30-40% increase)

> with the 60-minute contest mode, top comment is posted around 11 minutes after the thread's creation (on average). this is an incredible increase and very rare for reddit as a whole. we're taking this as a win. (around 120-150% increase)

> unfortunately, we can't ever address the issue that a comment posted 10 minutes earlier will get more visibility and upvotes. however, this has mitigated the issue slightly, and now there is a much larger window for people to write more quality comments. 

**currently, the average top comment is approximately 246 characters long (or 41 words according to google).**

> we don't have concrete statistics for comment length prior to the change. however, we know it was much shorter. i think it was somewhere around half?

> this shows that the contest mode has allowed users to write longer comments without worrying about being first. longer comments don't always mean higher quality, but we have noticed a powerful improvement to the overall comment quality (based on personal use and community feedback).

# original thread info

hey all you assholes and judges. we recently ran a few statistics on our sub and we found a major problem. a huge percentage of our top voted comments are made in the first 5 minutes after the thread's creation. take a look here(https://m.imgur.com/a/vzvv1ag). 

we think that's a problem. a comment shouldn't be considered ""top"" just because it was posted first. we want to encourage quality and thoughtful comments, rather than 3 word quips. so, we've decided to fuck with the sub.

# introducing ~~30-minute~~ 60-minute contest mode

for the first 60 minutes after a thread is posted, it will run **contest mode.** the comment order will be random, and not sorted by popularity. you will not be able to see the karma score of comments. after 30 minutes is up, you will be able to see everything again. the comment order will be ""best"" instead. 

**why did we do this?** the first comment shouldn't have an unfair advantage. by opening 30 minutes of randomization, everyone posting in the first 60 minutes has a more fair and equal chance of having their comment seen by the community. no one's comment will be buried into oblivion anymore. we tried contest mode in the past, but for much longer (a few hours). it didn't work out well. a 60-minute length will not have as much of an impact on a thread's popularity, and hopefully you guys will like it better.",3
"for 100% refusing to let my dad/mom see my child for something done 10-15 years ago? /petty. ok so this is kinda complex, i'll make it short.  this acc is just for privacy reasons

-i always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. i never had problems with my parents before this. 

-i went to med school, still living with parents when i was 20, i dated someone who was 23

-dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says i cannot date j. 

-argument breaks out, dad says it's his house so either i agree or i move out. i say it's not fair as j has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. dad kicks me out. mom agrees with his decision. little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-i moved with j, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (i went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-years later, me and j (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (like really small but i'm happy with it). i ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. i let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  he came a few times. 

-today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when i was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. i said never and that i wasn't going to forgive them. bro says i'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, i say that's bullshit because dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. bro says i should at least let mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. i say mom was able to do something but didn't,but that bro's situation was different because he was only 15. bro is upset because he says mom and dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that i am dragging this entire situation. i told him that if he thinks i'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. he's angry and says that i need to move on and that i shouldn't be withholding them from seeing their grandchild. i say that they disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

aita? i don't hate my bro and i (kinda)  get what he is saying, but i just have a resentment for my parents. it's not like i had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks i'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. i'm curious on what reddit thinks. i want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",3
"update to: someone is threatening to release nude photos of me that were taken when i was underage and i'm terrified that i'll lose my job and be arrested for what is essentially child porn (ohio). original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/4xrn91/ohio_someone_is_threatening_to_release_nude/

so as the title states, last year i was dealing with blackmail from someone who got a hold of nudes from when i was 14/15. i thought i would update now that it's come to a resolution.

i went to see a lawyer the day after i made that post. he drafted a letter formally telling the guy to fuck off, and was very kind in assuring me that i had nothing to worry about. it was radio silence from the guy, for about six months. then i got an email from another address with the same demand, saying that the money needed to be sent in 24 hours or the pictures would go live. 

i panicked and called my lawyer, asking him to meet me at the police station. he was really understanding (literally left his daughter's birthday party to come help me) and when we got there, we met with a detective, who was also really nice and heard me out. 

long story short, we found out that the guy blackmailing me was actually (drumroll please) my ex-boyfriend masquerading as someone else. he was arrested, and it was also discovered that he had broken into my apartment on a few occasions (he had things in his possession that he could only have gotten by getting into my residence). i wasn't the only one who was being stalked, and they also discovered other illegal activity that i wasn't really allowed to know about.

anyway, my ex was just sentenced a few days ago and he won't be getting out anytime soon, plus i'm getting married in a few months and i'll be moving to another state far away from my ex. so i thought i'd update here with the good news! i was afraid that i'd be arrested and lose everything, but thanks to you guys i got up the courage to deal with the situation. i really appreciate the advice i got here! thank you again so much.

"my 45m wife 42f revealed she was unfaithful and i'm divorcing her. our children 15f & 17m hate me for it.. edit: guys, i appreciate the advice. but i'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. i've made my decision, and it's not something i'm willing to forgive. i'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

my wife and i have been together for 18 years. we had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. we've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

about two weeks ago i brought up an advice column in the paper i had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and i could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so i asked her what was bothering her. she confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. this was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. she says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. we talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. i realized i knew i'd never be able to let this go, nor would i be able to forgive her. she's distraught.

we sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. obviously this was extremely tough. they acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. my wife and i agreed to tell them it was mutual, but i guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. this had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. my wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. i don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so i'm being trying to explain as tactfully as i can, but they're gone as far as saying that when i get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that i still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. my wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since i've told her of my plan to leave.

i love my kids, but i don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. i don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that i'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. i just know that i cannot get past this, and for my own happiness i need to leave. any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

tl;dr wife revealed past infidelity. i'm leaving. kids hate me for it.",7

"meta: this sub is moving towards a value system that frequently doesn't align with the rest of the world. i've enjoyed reading and posting on this sub for many months now, and i feel like i've noticed a disconcerting trend, lately. over time, more and more of the posts seem to have a- a universal consensus on every post, with any dissenters massively downvoted and b- a shift towards judgments that seem (to me at least) to be out of step with how people in the real world judge situations.

given that, i think it's important to remember that even though the sub is not intended to be for validation posts or to be an echo chamber or to give advice on how people should behave in specific situations- in practice, a lot of times it is.

so just as a reminder- offline, people in your real life will think you're an asshole if you take the last cookie when you know the child behind you wants it.

they'll think you're an asshole if you don't stand up for an elderly person on a bus. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. they'll think you're an asshole if you don't try to be involved in your child's life, no matter how much support you pay. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you're childfree. they'll think you're an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. they'll think you're an asshole if you can't detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.

the internet has its own values, and that's fine. but in the real world, people who can't just go along to get along most of the time? people who don't want to mildly inconvenience themselves to help out the people around them? people who don't seem to put any stock into the idea of collectivism? the people around them are going to consider them to be assholes.

so yeah. i love this sub, i love reading the stories and i find it very interesting to hear people's opinions. but i personally think that probably more than 50% of the time, the people i know in real life would disagree with the sub's judgement of who's the asshole in a given situation. i don't know if the disparity is just because of reddit's demographics, or because people with alternate perspectives see the writing on the board and don't want to get down voted to oblivion.

so even if you get 4000 replies on reddit saying that you're totally in the right, if everyone in your real life thinks you're an asshole, well… there's probably a reason for that. and maybe this is just me, but i really wish we could have more discussion about if someone is being an asshole if they're being inconsiderate or selfish, even if they don't technically ""owe"" anyone anything.

or maybe you believe that people offline are wrong, and we should continue to promote the individualistic value system seen on reddit both on and offline. that's a discussion worth having too.

edit: thanks guys, this is very interesting discussion so far. and lol don't just downvote the people who disagree with me/you, engage them without being combative.

"for telling my wife and in-laws to fuck off after they told me to stop cuddling my daughter?. i have 3 kids, 15f, 12f and 7m. my oldest has always been a cuddler, and that suits me fine because i am too. recently my in laws were over, and we were all watching a movie together. it was a kids movie, and so my 15yo was bored out of her mind and tired, so she started to snuggle up to me and go to sleep.

after the movie was over, we sent all the kids to bed/their rooms and got chatting for a bit longer. there was a fair bit of wine involved (i was sober though), and eventually after a short silence my fil let it drop that he thought it was inappropriate i still cuddled with my 15yo. i don't really know why he brought it up suddenly, but i was prepared to laugh it off and just assumed it was the alcohol. to my surprise, my wife and mil both agreed with him.

i have a lot of respect for my in-laws, i get along with them great and i consider them closer than my own parents. obviously i'm quite fond of my wife as well, but i outright told them to ""fuck off and go fuck themselves"" and then left them and went to bed. i've never spoken to any of them like that before, but it felt like the right thing to say in the moment. they all want me to apologize for being so rude to them. aita?

"by sleeping with a married woman.. so, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. nsfw or for anyone, really. and i may not be alive much longer, because i'm probably going to be murdered.

i'm at the bar the other night, watching the hall of fame game. after it's over, i go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before i uber home. this girl sitting next to me, very attractive. out of my league. like wayyy out. i'm just scrolling through memes on my phone. and she asks me 

""hey! can i trust you to watch my things and not drug me?""

 ""uhh what?""

 ""can you watch my stuff while i go pee and not drug me"" 

to which the bartender said ""oh you can trust greg, he's really nice"". annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.

girl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. just random shit. showed pictures of our dogs to each other. talked about shows n stuff. typical 'meet a girl at a bar' flirting shit. she asks if i've ever seen the show years and years. i say ""no, but i've seen the band perform live"". so she goes on about how great the show is, and how i need to watch it. asks if i have hbogo. ""yes because i forgot to cancel my cable after got"". so she makes me download the app, so i could start watching it when i get home. thanks for the recommendation! i'll probably check it out never. so a few minutes later, she said

 ""hey do you live close by?"" 

""yea, like half a mile""

 ""we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. i have a bottle of whiskey in my car""

""idk, my house is kind of a mess right now""

""that's okay, i have pets too"" (or something like that. all i was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)

""i mean i guess, but i have to be at work early tomorrow""

""that's okay, i can only stay 30-40 minutes and then i'll have to go home""
""that's fine"" heh, cuz that's all the time i'll need! am i right, fellas??

no. nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.

it's about, 11pm at this point. i think? and mind you, i've only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.

so we tab out, get in her car. which is a stick shift. and i say ""oh no shit, i like you even more now! no one drives a stick anymore! i drive one every day!"" which i'm excited about, because at this point i'm thinking to myself ""hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows i like, and imma bout to get laid""

we talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn't the first time that this subject came up). which is just a half mile away. so was a short drive. she parks behind my car, blocking my car in.

go inside, i try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. while i try to get my chromecast set up on my living room tv. ya know, to ""watch hbogo"".

she runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.

it's fucking evan williams.

and this is the first time where an ""oh no"" thought crosses my mind.

kids, i've slept with some strange in my time. i don't know how or why i get myself into these situations. i honestly feel that i'm a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. sure i troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but i do genuinely care about other people. being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. but in this case, i was dead wrong.

so after some talking about random shit. we get the show playing. i couldn't even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.

sex.

so after, we're just laying there. pillow talk. was a good night. i just got laid. she asked if she could stay the night. we're gonna go to sleep. everything is cool. i let her know that i have to be at work in a few hours, so i need to get some rest.

now, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* right?

wrong.

i say ""that was great we should do this again sometime""

""i don't think so""

""what why?""

""i don't think my husband would appreciate that""



i am speechless. i don't think i've ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. like, how the fuck did i not see this coming. omg imma home wrecker. i'm probably gonna get shot of he finds out.

me: ""ummmmmmm what? is this an open relationship? does he know where you're at? like, why didn't you tell me that?""

her: ""idk, does it matter?""

""uh yeah, i'd be pretty pissed if i was him""


now i've been cheated on before. and that feeling sucks. i've been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. where i didn't know that i was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. i had found out a couple days later, and i found him on fb and let him know. he thanked me, and didn't get mad at me at all. cheating is the worse thing ever.

so this is where shit starts to hit the fan. i don't remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:

her: ""we're getting separated soon""

me: ""well you're still fucking married to him""

""yea but that's okay""

""how is that okay?""

""he's been..... abusive""


there's a slight pause, then she starts crying. so this is where the sober me starts to kick in. this girl is struggling. she's in a bad spot. and no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. and now i'm trying to empathize with this trashy evan williams drinking bitch. like i legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.

que the panic attack.

she starts going nuts. ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. knocking shit over. basically trashing my house.

she asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. which i do. she takes it. and calms down. (for the most part).

now this is like, 2 or 3 am now. i tell her that we need to go to sleep. because i have to work in the morning. she tells me ""(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy"" btw, evan williams isn't that bad when you're slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.

we finally get to sleep around 4? maybe? i wake up late, she wants round 3. and who doesn't like morning sex. i'm still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. so i gave her a fuck.

anyways, i need to leave for work. but her car is blocking mine. i tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can't because she didn't know where her clothes were. and told me i couldn't move it because ""i didn't know how to drive it"" 

""uhh, this is the third time we've had this conversation. i drive a stick every day, i can move your car""

i move her car. i leave for work. and i just let her stay at my house. i let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. two, i was already running late, and fuck it she'll probably leave before i get home.

a couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. i get concerned, because i'm starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. i came to the conclusion that i should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... but, i see that she had already messaged him. from my facebook account! my computer was still logged into fb when i left, and i didn't think to log out or shut it off or anything.

i tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. he lets me go home. when i get home, i find her still naked in my bed. i get her friend to get her an uber. and i leave. oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷‍♂️.

go back to work. thinking everything is over. that's the end of that. wrong again.

i get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. and only that shirt. like vag all out and everything. this girl is afraid to go home. which i'm worried about at this point. because i want her to go somewhere safe. she's refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.

oh yea, she had me find her phone. which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. and several others from other people.

she hands me $20 to order a pizza. and after we eat the pizza, she'd uber home. fuckin bet. i ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.

i kid you not. i'm sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. and she just opens her legs and says ""make it quick""

this bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and i'm just ready for her to leave.

sex.

after, we're just sitting there, and she starts crying again. asking to go home. and i'm like 

""i'll get you an uber home, but you gotta put pants on""
""no""

""what do you mean 'no'? you can't get in an uber with your pussy out""

""no""


so i gather up all of her belongings and clothes. and try to help her get dressed. to which she refused to allow me to do.

most guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... that ""arch"" thing that women do when you're pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.

#i had the same feeling when i got her panties on.

pizza arrives. i go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. come back inside. panties are off again. god dammit.

we never even opened the pizza box. she's saying that she wants to go home. but is refusing to get dressed. i'm starting to panic myself. because i don't know how i got myself into this situation. but, am me.

she eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that's she having with her husband. and i read through the conversation, it's her sending multiple texts saying ""i'm so sorry babe"" ""idk where i'm at"" ""come get me"". and him saying ""nope sorry"" ""this is on you"" and ""call 911""

that last one though. that's what i did.

before i called 911, i offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because i knew the husband would give her a ride back there. and not to my house. because now i'm starting to worry about my safety. i don't want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. but then again she states that ""you don't know how to drive my car"" with it being a stick and all. even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.

i told them that i have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. etc. i tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn't answer.

the ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. this girl is drunk crying. trying to get me to go for yet another round. where at this point, my dick hurts. also, ""girl you need to get dressed, you're gonna be going home""

finally got her panties back on, i didn't tell her that i had called the cops. i told her that the uber was coming. and was trying to get her to put her pants on.

cops show up, i go outside. explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. but i kept my calm. i told them that i was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. but they can't force her to go anywhere she didn't want to. she wanted to go home. officers ask if she was presentable. i pop my head back in the door. she's still wearing my shirt and her panties. so i'm like ""i guess?"", and then i let them in.

she yells ""are you fucking serious? you called the cops?"" 
""uh yea, you didn't wanna leave. even though you said you did. plus your husband said to call 911, so that's what i did""

the officer said to her ""you're on this man's property, and he wants you to leave""

que crying and what not.

cops ask me to gather all of her stuff. which i do. her husband calls her phone, so i accept the call, and then put it up to her face. tell her to tell him what's happening. and that she is getting an uber home. apparently her card and paypal was getting declined for the ride. so she couldn't do it herself. they live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. i live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a lyft/uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... girl finally decides to get dressed.

i had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... i could see the officer's partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. lol.

anyways, i hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she's still wearing mine) to the officer. made sure she had all of her belongings. we get her to walk out of my house to the uber. but she tried to grab the bottle of evan williams. to where i audibly laughed. ""i don't think they'll let you take that""

cops didn't let her take it. she got in the uber and she was gone. policeman handed me the bottle back. where i say ""usually this is the other way around, ha""

po-po leave, i call it a night, and it's over.

flash forward to today. i get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she's asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. i was at work at the time. so i wasn't able to check. but i'm 98% certain i handed those over to the cops. i look for them when i get home. found nothing.

oh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.

so that brings us to now. i haven't heard anything from her. or the husband. and i'm not sure if it's safe for me to go home. but ya. know what? fuck it. i'm glad i could share this story with y'all. there might be more to come, but you'll probably have to read about it in my obituary.

the moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂

jk don't do that.

and don't stick your dick in crazy.

tldr: took a girl home who i didn't know was married. she trashed my house.

edit: i'm not gonna change ""que"" to ""cue"" because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while i deal with mine.

edit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2gia

edit 3: her car is still there. can't get it towed, because it's on a public street. i'm still alive. i see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. i'll get to them when i can.

edit 4: fml. i sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. no response. bartender texted me late last night and asked if i used a condom. which many of you have asked.... and no. i didn't. the girl told me that she was on birth control and that she's allergic to latex. so i think i may have been baby baited.

edit 5: i'm still not dead. her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor's house. i just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. so i walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it's front of their house... this woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. and she's most likely high on meth. because when i asked her ""hey do you wanna get this car that's in front of your house towed?"" she said ""no, noooo hehe"" i'm like ""yea, i'll talk to y'all tomorrow"" just wtf.

**update**

i've been texting a mutual friend of the couple. apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. i'm in the works of a tifupdate. but i'll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. i'd like to protect the privacy of those involved, but i'm just too lazy to do it right now.",4
"the us sounds like a truly horrible place to live. scrolling through reddit it's full of ridiculous medical bills, companies like at&t fleecing people for more money while providing rubbish service, out of control student debts and requiring degrees for entry level positions with rubbish pay, no good minimum wage and high taxes.  

it appears as though companies can do what they want to the ""little people"" as long as the right peoples pockets are being lined, nothing seems to have any regulation and no one who can do anything about it seems to care.

"update - mi, usa considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now i have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

i promised an update so here it is. first off, i want to thank everyone who strongly suggested i go see a doctor asap. i went to see an ent and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. my hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. the tinnitus was still quite bad, so i wanted to see if the doc could help with that. he put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. i saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (this was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

the ringing has gone down considerably, and i'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. it still bothers me at night and while i'm trying to work sometimes. the biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so i haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. this has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point i'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

my uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. i'm not planning on suing him. he knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what i was going through. my aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. i haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. they have offered to call me and apologize but i don't want to talk to them. i just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. i'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but i don't care. fuck that guy. thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice.",2

"got laid off and now the company that laid me off is trying to hire me back at a discount.. three months ago i was laid off as part of a 60 person lay off in a small company of 125 people.  i do occupational health and safety work as i was the manager.   i was given unemployment; been searching for jobs.

fast forward 3 months, tax bill passed, etc.  i get a phone call from the president of the company asking me to come in because he has an opportunity.  he tells me things are picking back up and the company needs me back but he's trying to shop me at a discounted rate.

i had been with the company 6 years and he says he wants to give me 20 hours at 60% of what i was making to do consulting work for 4 months until my lease is up.  this seems like a super low ball offer especially because they don't have to train anyone, i already know all of the employees, i am familiar with their policies as i wrote many of them.  also after 4 months i cant get back on unemployment and having taken such a drastic pay cut i wouldn't be very well equipped to ask for more money in the future.

i feel like this is a slap in the face and i want to counter offer their 60% slap with a 125% slap back.

does this seem unreasonable??  just seeking some guidance.

faq:

> where do they come from?

the source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. ligo observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). 

> how fast do they go?

gravitational waves travel at the speed of light (wiki(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speed_of_gravity)).

> haven't gravitational waves already been detected?

the 1993 nobel prize in physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, psr b1913+16(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/psr_b1913%2b16).

in 2014, the bicep2(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bicep_and_keck_array#bicep2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. a joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the planck and bicep2 team in january 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the milky way.

> does this mean we can control gravity?

no. more precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. it takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. for more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see here(http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/waves/gwave_spectrum.html).

> what's the practical application?

here(http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.

> how is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? is this gravitons?

here(https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that! (see limits on gravitons below!)

"for ignoring a coworker who refused to use my actual name?. i've worked at my office for 8 years. i'm on good terms with management and most of my co-workers.
​

five months ago, a new guy was hired on a 6-month probationary period. i'm not his supervisor, but i'm definitely a senior employee. i'll call the guy ted faro, because he's a dick.

​

supervisor was going around introducing ted to people, and when he got to me said ""this is john"" and described my job.

​

ted: ""hi, jack.""

me: ""it's john.""

​
ted: ""what?""
​

me: ""my name's john, not jack.""

ted: ""it's close enough for me.""

supervisor: ""his name's john, not jack. let's move on.""

​

this continued for a few months. despite reminders from supervisors (when he referred to me when i wasn't present) and myself, he continued to use the name jack. i finally told him ""you either use my name, or i ignore you completely, no matter what the situation is.""

​

his response was ""sure thing, jackie boy.""

​

since i don't work directly with him, i figured ""screw it"" and that i'd ignore him.

​

recently he had a 2-day business trip that required car rental. i work late some nights, and ted came to me and says ""hey, jack, i'll be dropping the rental car off at 7 when i get back. see you there for a lift back to the office!""

​

(they closed at 6 and there's a drop box)

​

as promised, i ignored him.

​

7:15 rolls around on the night he's dropping off and i get a call. i recognize his number, so i ignored it. he called 7 more times, then starts e-mailing.

the first one was along the lines of ""jack i'm at enterprise. come pick me up.""

e-mails pour in every 5-10 minutes, addressing me as jack, jack-o, jackie, and jackie-boy. the emails also started being laced with profanity and a couple threats.

​

i signed out and went home. it was raining hard.

next morning, i saw that ted had sent a few more e-mails. i printed them off. at 10am, he storms up to my desk and  screams ""where the f-bomb were you? i told you when to pick me up! i had to take a cab! do you know how much that cost me?!"" he goes on like that for a bit until his supervisor came and hauled him away and asked to speak to me.

​

supervisor: ""ted tells me that you ignored his requests for a pickup when he dropped off the rental. he was caught out in the rain.""

​

i relayed what happened, and showed him the printed e-mails. i'd highlighted the threats.

supervisor: ""i can see why you wouldn't want to spend time around him. but it was still kind of inconsiderate to leave him stranded in the rain. that's not the greatest neighborhood and he could have been hurt."" he sighed and said ""with the threats and him being on probation, he no longer works here. just try not to be an a-hole in retaliation to your coworkers.""

​

a few people at the office have commented that i'm the jerk for ignoring ted and getting him riled up, which got him fired.

"seriously, get and use a credit card. i've encountered many people, both in my personal life and online, that insist upon using a debit card for their purchases, instead of using a credit card -- either because they don't yet have one, or because they have some fear of using a credit card. there are literally no cons to using a credit card if, and here's the catch, **you're responsible**. that's all. there are so many pros built in to using a credit card over a debit card. here are a few:

**it's safer!** when you use a debit card to make a purchase, you're essentially handing the merchant direct access to your bank account. should the waitress at the restaurant you're eating at write down your debit card number or should your favorite grocery store experience a breach, that's direct access to your account and your money. yeah you can file a fraud dispute with your bank and get your money back eventually, but in the meantime, that money is poof, gone.

compare this to using a credit card - when you do this, you're using the creditor's money to make your purchase and you don't have to pay it until your statement closes. you have a 30 day window in between payments to make sure that all purchases on your card are yours. and if there's a purchase you didn't make, that's not your money missing. 

**it builds your credit.** when you use a credit card responsibly, it will build your credit over time. which if you're young may not be a big deal to you, but eventually you might want to buy a car or house, and unless you have a lump sum sitting in cash, you're going to need to finance it. low interest loans are granted to people with good credit scores, meaning you pay the bank less in interest to use their money. compared to someone with poor credit who will either get a high interest loan or no loan at all.

the caveat here is that you never miss a payment. ever. a good rule of thumb is to only spend on credit what you can pay cash for at the same time. you should never buy something on credit that you couldn't otherwise afford at that same point in time with your debit card.

**purchase protection.** a lot of major credit card companies (like american express and discover) offer a suite of purchase protection features. this is especially useful when you buy big ticket items (like a flat screen tv or laptop, for example), because it adds a layer of protection to you, the consumer. some features are:

* accidental damage coverage - if you break your device in the first couple months of owning it, you can get it replaced by your credit card company.
* better price guarantee - just bought an expensive item but found a better deal somewhere else? the credit card company will cover the difference.
* theft protection - if your item is stolen within the first few months of owning it, your credit card company will replace it for you
* extended warranty - all my credit cards offer 100% of the manufacturer's original warranty on any purchase. 1 year manufacturer's warranty on my iphone becomes a 2 year warranty including the extra year of coverage from the credit card company. 

and many more.

**the credit card company will reward you for using it.** most credit cards offer points or cash back that you earn every time you swipe your card on things you'd already be buying anyways. same applies for paying bills. so by using a credit card, you can get a percentage of cash back or points that you can redeem later or put towards a purchase or vacation/trip.

some tips on using a credit card: 

* never miss a payment. ever. you will destroy your credit with as little as one missed payment.
* only buy on a credit card what you can afford to buy on a debit card at the same point in time. this is how people end up with $1,000s in credit card debt - because they use their card irresponsibly and then can't afford the payments. being responsible is the only thing it takes to use a credit card.
* pay in full - only suckers make the minimum payments. when you only pay the minimum each month, the credit card companies will charge you interest for using their money longer than the 30 day statement period. whatever you heard about making the minimum payment to boost your credit score is false. paying your card off in full achieves the same score improvements.

hopefully this post is enough to convince you to make the move to responsible spending with a credit card. they're awesome financial tools to build your credit and build your future as a responsible adult, and all it takes is responsibility and self control now.

here's a success story for you now that you've gotten through this post. a couple months ago my credit card number was skimmed and used several states away from me. the purchase was at a small convenience mart and was only a few dollars, as the thief was likely testing the card to make sure it works. my bank notified me immediately of the fraud alert. all i had to do was say it wasn't me who made the charge and it disappeared. never had to deal with it again. granted, a couple bucks didn't do any harm to me, but had that been a purchase of $1000 or more, that would have stung if it was my debit card that made the purchase.

i applied for my first credit card the day i turned 18. i now have four credit cards with $50,000 in available open credit across them and a credit score of 780 at age 23. all it took was a little persistence and responsibility. if i can do it, believe me, so can you.

"for telling my waitress's manager she did a great job?. not a clickbait title, that's actually what happened. i got called an asshole for it, so now i have come here out of curiosity for you fine people to help settle the disagreement.

i met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. two nights ago was our third date and i was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. nothing fancy, i just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. this girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. she's funny, charming, and smart. we had had several great dates and i was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. she is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

our waitress for dinner was great. actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. at one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

at the end of the meal, she brought the check and i told her i would like to speak with her manager. she asked if there was something wrong, and i calmly repeated that i would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. she leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and i proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. he thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

the only one not happy was my date. she said, ""if that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that i was full of myself. she didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. i texted her saying i was sorry for whatever i did wrong and that i'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

"my (22f) fiance (25m) want his father to check my hymen tomorrow night before i get married.. my fiance proposed to me about 8 months ago. we decided on having a relatively small wedding which is in two days. everything was going great. he seems absolutely perfect and we are very much in love.

i am a virgin and so is he, he wanted to save it for marriage and i wasn't fussed so i agreed to saving it. he has told me earlier that in his family the father checks the virginity of the bride the night before the wedding. i laughed this off as it seriously sounds like a massive joke. no turns out he was dead serious. he wants me, the night before to open my legs up in a small ceremony type thing so his dad can check me while him, his brothers and uncle can watch so that they know i am still 'pure'.

i told him fat chance i am going to do that and he was begging to me to go through with it and how important it is for him. he said he knew it was slightly embarrassing for me but his mom did and it will prove how much i love him and that i have nothing to hide anyway as i am still a virgin. i left and he was crying, it was very dramatic tbh.

i want to call off the whole wedding because of this and never talk to him again. but at the same time its only one thing and other then that we are genuinely perfect for each other and i dont want to spend my life with anyone else and it is very important to him and his family.

edit1: well this went out of proportion. rip my inbox. 

some clarification about my opinion. no i am not saying 'the first world countries should adopt kids from third world countries'

geez stop assuming that your country have figured out all the shit already. and now you have no problems and are left with helping the third world countries. so stop saying, hey i'm from norway and i don't want to adopt an african child. your country have zero orphanage?
it's funny how most of you guys assumed that you have to adopt a kid from african countries.

no i'm not pro 'let's adopt and help the third world'
i'm pro ""can't feed em, don't breed em""! 
but if you have money to raise a child, try adopting one, it'll make you happy and you'll be giving a child probably a new beautiful life.

and someone said the adoption cost is ~30,000$ like wtf!
your country needs to figure out some shit for that man. this cost is an average cost to raise a child for 10 years fulfilling his basic needs and school fees in my country man!

"i used to steal tons of food from my old job by pretending to be a customer ordering food and then calling 30 minutes later asking to cancel it. i used to work at this restaurant and the management there was just awful and the gm was just very verbally abusive. she always would complain about everything and one thing specifically was how there would be 1 or 2 customers who would order food and then never show up, she ended up letting the servers and hosts eat the food. so it gave me an idea. 
one day she said something that really pissed me off, so i called my job and ordered a bunch of food under a different name and then that ""customer"" would never show up. it made her livid and it gave me the bold idea of doing that whenever i want a lunch. i started to do it an hour or so before my break and i would order whatever i felt like eating that day and when they'd call and cancel i'd ask a supervisor if i could have the food and they'd say sure. 
i did this for the entire 3 years that i worked there 2 times a week, sometimes even 3. i didn't ever get caught , and i've even had a coworker help me by being the one to answer the phone. it was kinda funny and that place was awful, so i kinda deserved it.

"update: old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues i'm having."" found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (mn). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

&#x200b;

**old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that i was having a ton of issues. i found out my therapist is her husband, but i didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200b;

**new developments summary**: there's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. i even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200b;

**new developments, continued**: therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). i have a very peculiar family dynamic, so i think he talked about that. however, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that i was depressed and had family issues. neat. one of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200b;

**resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than i thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. i don't know if he'll practice again.

&#x200b;

***thank you all -*** you were a huge help, and a confidence boost that me complaining about this would actually get it somewhere and not just create more stress in my life. it's apparently led to a ton of drama at my old workplace, which has been sort of pleasant to hear updates about from afar. glad to not be there anymore. i also found a new therapist who's great, and she's really helped validate that the old guy (and his wife) was one bag egg in a sea of otherwise well-meaning people.",2
"because i finally learned how to wipe my butt. i asked my girlfriend the other day, ""why do the doors of the bathroom stalls have space on the bottom?""

she told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

i followed up by saying, ""but sometimes, people can see my butt.""

she started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

so i had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; i wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

i then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/(http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and i was shocked.

we were both curious where/how i even learned that from.

was it a potty training error? apparently not. we asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

so, i've been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.

\#dead

tl;dr

for 20 years, i squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt.",4

a few hours ago a woman contacted me asking if i was able to design a logo for her and her perfume brand.
the conversation was polite until she said she was unable to pay me and might was able to pay me in a different way (which i think nudes and  i am under age).
she told me she would fuck me up and i didn't take it serious,  just had a good laugh out of it and posted it on reddit (post(https://www.reddit.com/r/choosingbeggars/comments/au7ygj/sure_ill_make_a_logo_that_i_have_to_work_3_hour/?st=jsjae8gg&sh=35d7b55d)

lately i've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. the last time i caught them i threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.

i caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police i grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard. 

i just had a group of angry parents come to my house complaining about my actions. absolutely none of them was willing to apologize for their children's actions. one parent in particular is threatening to sue me, because her son's iphone 10 was ruined with water. i told her that was her problem for letting her eight-year-old son have a $1,000 phone. then i threatened to spray them with my hose if they didn't get off of my property.",3
"180 days later, bank of america is refusing to refund over $700 in fraudulent charges made in texas while we were 800 miles away in illinois.. back in july we were wrapping up our yearly road trip to illinois. we purchased gas around 8 or 9am right before we started the 12 hour trip to texas.

&#x200b;

two hours into the trip my wife gets a notification on her phone from bank of america alerting her to fruadulent charges being made. we only have one debit cad.

&#x200b;

while we were starting our driving home, someone in austin, tx purchased around $500 in merch at home depot, drove towards houston, tx attempting twice to use our card at the atm, which did not work because they didnt have the pin. they made their $200-ish last transaction at tj maxx north of houston before were alerted and had the card shut off. (austin to houston is about a 3 hour car ride)

&#x200b;

my wife immedately makes a claim. 10 days later, we get the money credited back while they continue the investigation which seems pretty open and shut to me... they also say it may be another 45 days before they finish their investigation.

&#x200b;

october 5, they send a letter stating that they have completed their investigation: ""our records show the transaction activity in question was authorized for and posted to your account."" the letter states they'll be taking the $740 back on october 22.

&#x200b;

wife calls and has them reopen the case or escalate it. we're told it could be another 45 days.

&#x200b;

december 22. we call bank of america again. this agent has no record of anything being escalated. says he will escalate it and we should hear from someone in the next few business days. nothing.

&#x200b;

jan 3. wife calls them again. this agent states that while an escalation sends an email to their investigators notifying that we are still asking about they case, they are under no obligation to complete it.

&#x200b;

after reading a bit into the law surrounding this, we have realized we can request the documentation they used to close the investigation.

&#x200b;

what else can we do? do we need a lawyer? if they had to reimburse us for the first 45 days of the investigation, why do they not have to temporarily reimburse us as they continue to investigate ""for as long as they need"" with no date set for resolution on our end?

&#x200b;

it is blatantly obvious that someone skimmed the card at some point and had a dummy one made. are they able to continue to withhold our $750 indefinitely and just keep saying. ""nope! looks good!"" until we tire out?

&#x200b;

our kiddos missed out on a lot of christmas gifts because of this and now bills are starting to get a bit tight. we really need this money back. thanks yall!

**update:** started posting on social media before i start filing complaints. 20 minutes later bank of america contacted me on twitter. will update later. thanks for everyone's advice.

**update 2: 3 hours later...** i continued to post on social media, reaching out to local news stations on twitter that have community protection or investigative segments and linking to this post. bank of america has now reached out in one of these posts, referencing my wifes name. fingers crossed.  http://imgur.com/gallery/i4gwtc0(http://imgur.com/gallery/i4gwtc0)

**update 3:** wife got home 30 min after my last update. a rep with boa actually called her asking what was going on. the rep said she would need to call the fraud department and get them all on the line together. we are at our kids practice so opted for them to call us when they have someone on the line who can help us. will update later.

**update 4:** just got off the phone with someone in the fraud department at bank of america. i recorded the whole convo and will be uploading it to youtube. she says the call on oct 22 did in fact reopen the case. (even though the rep on dec 22 said otherwise and the rep earlier today said they have no timeline to adhere to and can take as long as they want)

they now have 60 business days from oct 22 to finish the claim once again.

she says one of the reasons that the claim was denied was because the didnt attempt to drain her account. (they hit up two atms and failed to use the pin to drain the account, so they don't even have the correct info to base their findings off)

i requested documentation about the claim as law allows and she says i should get that in 10 business days. they now have until jan 18 to notify us of their findings. i'm going to continue with filing reports and posting on social media.

i'll update in a few weeks i guess.

**update 5: 10 hours later,** they have blocked me on facebook for sharing my problems on their page. i also filed a complaint with the cfpb .

**update 6:** 24 hours since this post and david, a bank of america employee in the ""regulatory complaints department"" left my wife a voice mail  in regards to a complaint sent to them by the cfpb. they close at 4pm est. (they're closed by the time we got the voice mail since she is at work). will update monday.

**update 7:** wife woke up this morning and the money has been returned to our account. time to turn and burn!

thank you everyone for your advice. we learned a lot from this.

"for sleeping naked on top of the covers to teach my flatmate's gf a lesson?. new to reddit, please bare with. 

so i (21, guy) live with my childhood best friend (22, also a guy) and have done for 2 years now. up until last week, things were perfect between us. 

however, he recently got a new girlfriend (23, lady) and she honestly seems absolutely great except for one thing; she seemingly has a complete aversion to knocking. she and i have quite a lot in common, and i actually like spending time with her. however it bugs the hell out of me when she just barges into my room without knocking first. now, she's never walked in on me doing anything untoward; i'm usually just chilling on my bed or studying at my desk. however, on at least seven seperate occasions now she's done it first thing in the morning to ask if i want coffee. i sleep naked. every time prior to the last one, i've been under the covers and she hasn't seen anything. i always point out that she *could* have and she just giggles and says ""but i didn't"". 

when she stayed over last week, in order to make my point, i intentionally slept on top of the covers. sure enough, she barges in at 7am, begins to ask if i want coffee and sees my you-know-what. she immediately backed out of the room and didn't speak to me for the rest of the day. my mate later pulled me aside and said i was bang out of order, accused me of deliberately exposing myself and pointed out that i'd ""threatened"" to do it before (i literally just said ""okay but what if i had no covers and you saw everything"" before). they're now framing this to others that i'm some sick creep who intentionally got naked and lay in wait of her because that's how i get my rocks off, and i'm kinda seeing how it came off that way. for doing this?",3
"by thinking divorce was an april fools gag. let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on april fools day.

so here it goes... yesterday i got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (barb) house. 

i immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven't all got together since christmas so i overlooked it and said we (my wife and i ) were in. 

we were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. we all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (tim) informed the family that his wife (ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. the affair was with a long time close family friend (chris) who lived a block away.


chris' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law tim. 

both families have been friends for years. they live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. honestly, i have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. 

anyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. 

i broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. saying this was the best april fools gag i've ever seen but i wasn't falling for it. i told ashley and especially tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. 

being the newest member of the family (my wife and i married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. i probably should not have said anything. 

everyone in the room looked horrified. 

my mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. she left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. 

tim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. then berating me for being so insensitive. 


the rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...


i am still dumbfounded. in hindsight, i probably should have sat in silence... but i honestly still feel like i was calling out an april fools gag. 


#tldr

my borther in law's wife has been cheating on him. they told the family they are getting divorced. i broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying i'm no april fool.

wow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.

"(update) nebraska i just closed on a new house, sellers allege that i owe a portion of their 990$ security system cancellation fee because i did not take over their contract. threatening small claims court.. https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9h80ot/nebraska_i_just_closed_on_a_new_house_sellers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

thank you to all of the people who commented on the original thread. this was my first time dealing with small claims court and all of the helpful advice and information really helped set me up for success.


so, short story is that the sellers did end up taking me to court for roughly $1,400. this was for the total cost of the contract buy out for their security system, travel expenses since they moved out of state and would need to pay for gas and lodging to come back to sue us, as well as court costs. 


small claims court was surprisingly straight forward and informal. i've never been a big talker, but i honestly don't think i was able to say more than three words at a time without the plaintiff interrupting me. the judge eventually asked her to please stand in the hall way so i could speak my side fully. she absolutely refused to leave, but did stay quiet for a short minute so i could say that i never agreed to take over her security contract, and there was no documentation to suggest that i did.


the judge agreed and ended up ruling in my favor. i thought it was done there but the plaintiff swiftly appealed the decision. so now we had a new court date early this month with a different judge. 


during this time the plaintiff continues to send me hostile emails and voice messages. the seller's broker (their realtors boss) called me while i was at work to tell me he was very displeased i filed a formal complaint against his realtor. he told me i was not welcome to pursue any future business with his company, and i assured him the feeling was mutual. the broker said he supports all of his realtors and will not be acting on the complaint in any way. so i went and talked to the mayor's office about the situation. the mayor asked me what i wanted out of this, and i showed him the hostile emails from the seller and told him i felt it was the realtor's job to act as an in-between, even after the sell was complete. the mayor said he would step in and speak with the broker. (this is a fairly small town, they probably already knew each other). 


i never heard from the seller again after that, thanks mayor. so now it comes time for round 2 in small claims court. the new judge goes through and reads the write up from round 1 and asked the plaintiff if there is new evidence or information that has not been covered. long story short, there was not. the judge ended up sustaining the previous ruling in my favor, and strongly advised the plaintiff not to appeal unless there is new evidence or information that has not been seen by the court.


it's been five days and no word on an appeal so i think it's safe to say i'm finally done and ready to put this whole ugly thing behind me. once again thank you to all of you who helped me on the original thread. i'm very pleased that resources like this community exist.


on a final note, gossip, but i got a call from the mayor at 2am the night before last because there was a house fire down the street from me. (the mayor and i know each other well). so i went to go help the volunteer fire brigade put it out. we got it under control and we were winding down when a deputy from the sheriff's office comes to tell me that the lady who sued me waited around the court building the day of the appeal for the judge to get off, then tried to confront him about the ruling in the courthouse parking lot. i didn't really care to hear about it, but it sounds like she's in some pretty deep shit now. kind of cathartic.


tl;dr: they lost and i think it's finally over.

edit: thank you for all of the very kind and thoughtful messages! to clarify some common questions, the ruling stipulated that the plaintiff pays all court costs, including my own. yes, i could probably countersue, but i'm very interested in dealing with the seller and broker as little as possible for the rest of my life. :)

"at&t ran my credit not only without my permission, but after i explicitly stated i did not want a hard hit. i called in to ask what internet speeds were available in my area. he tried to sell me on cable, which i declined. he asked for my social and my date of birth. i asked him why he needed this and he explained it was to make sure i didn't have any past due balances with at&t. i then double checked and asked him if it would hit my credit and he chuckled and said ""no no sir nothing like that"". 

fast forward an hour, i have an email stating my installation for phone, cable, and internet is scheduled(???) and then a few minutes later an email from credit karma saying i had a hard inquiry. 

called in and spoke to 3 different departments, finally to a woman to tell me she couldn't remove it because calling in to inquire about service was all the consent they needed. 

this clearly doesn't seem legal, and wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences and what i should do next. 

tl;dr - spoke to att, they asked for social, i made sure it wouldn't hit my credit, i was told it wouldn't, and then it did. what next?

edit 3: filed a complaint with the cfpb. all the support and advice here has been a true blessing and i thank each and every one of you for taking the time to comment with good advice and/or possible solutions. 

edit 2: i called back in, and actually had a great conversation with someone who was super understanding and willing to help. she got me to the fraud department. i spoke with dorothy. she told me that it **did not matter** that i asked my credit not to be ran. that when someone calls in to inquire about service, they are consenting to a credit check. doesn't matter if i didn't give my social, they would have used my dob or dl #. she told me that i could not speak to a supervisor as this was standard practice, and she wouldn't escalate it. she also said some calls are recorded and some weren't, and she did not help me in finding the call from my first conversation. i then asked her for a copy of this call and her response was ""i don't know if it's being recorded so i can't help you"". she had nothing to say about the rep lying to me, and she said their credit disclaimer statement didn't sound anything like a credit disclaimer statement and i probably didn't even know it was read to me. unbelievable. this is their fraud department. jesus christ. 

edit: i see a lot of folks saying ""what's the big deal, couple points will fall off in no time"". i just got an email from credit karma that a hard inquiry from 2 years ago just fell off my report, and that left me with one hard hit which was back in january. i've been working very hard on rebuilding my credit, checking quite frequently and really boosting my score. one or two points may not be a big deal to some but after working so hard to improve my score, having it lowered without my authorization or consent is devastating.

"for grounding my daughter because she called my sil a ""slut""?. my daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. a boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. i believe he sent a video to her as well. before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. it appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. i notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200b;

my husband and i are respectful and non-judgmental of my sil's profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. my daughter is understandably upset and i feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. she unfriended my sil from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. she refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my sil house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. i tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200b;

my sil is hurt from all of this. not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. last weekend, i went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. my daughter refused and referred my sil as ""a vapid slut"" and her husband ""a pathetic cuck"" along with other slurs i don't want to repeat.

&#x200b;

i grounded her for three months and took away her internet. my husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that's too much. he also admitted he struggled accepting his sister's career path at first. he thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200b;

edit: seems like my husband is right and i went too far with the punishment. i just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. i'm going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. will decide with the husband later. we're definitely concerned for our daughter about what's happening at school and we're looking into therapy.

"by having my reddit history revealed by jimmy kimmel live on tv. this happened to me yesterday and i'm still baffled.

it all started when i posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor william h. macy. i couldn't stop laughin over it but i never thought it would gain so much attention. 

however it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes i could have imagined. this alone was crazy for me because i never expected to have a submission on the front page.

when i checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links i received. i checked them and found my submission on the latest jimmy kimmel show with reddit co-founder alexis ohanian. i was mind blown over this.

they proceeded talking over reddit users and jimmy ended up checking my history. well i hardly ever post filthy stuff but i commented on a nsfw a few days ago and i think jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.

keep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and im getting a lot of crazy messages now.

i don't know if this perfectly qualifies for a but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with 'filthy stuff' as he said. on the other hand it's just cool and a story to tell. however i regret nothing!

tl;dr: jimmy kimmel had reddit co-founder alexis ohanian as a guest. they ended up browsing my reddit history and jimmy made it look like there's filthy stuff going on.

"i (26f) am an escort and i am falling in love with one of my clients (39m). if you are going to pass judgment on my profession please dont, if you are going to tell me i am being exploited please don't i am not here for that.

&#x200b;

i took on this client about a year ago. i was immediately struck with how handsome he was. as i got to know him he showed himself to be a kind, sweet, charismatic, utterly brilliant person. he is always gentle i never had to enforce any boundaries with him. over the last year i have come to look forward to visits with him above any of my other clients. if there's a scheduling conflict i will give him the priority, lately i have been more intimate with him then my other clients, cuddles, kissing, hugs, and other things i dont do with my other clients. i love my overnights with him. we have long deep talks about everything we have a lot of shared interests and we just get along really well. i feel very safe with him.

&#x200b;

i am falling in love with him. its never happened to me before. i have always kept emotion separate from my work but i cant help it with him. i will spend time with him i dont bill him for, i spend extra time with him and just love to be with him. i've been spending time with him casually, going on... dates i guess for lack of better word that i'm not billing for either and the lines are starting to become very blurry.  i dont know what to do. i think i want to move the relationship from professional to personal, truth is it's already becoming personal to me, but i cant imagine he would be ok with my work if i was his gf. i am afraid of being rejected by him and ruining our work relationship, i think i would give this up to be with him but that presents a whole new set of problems for me in finding a new career.

&#x200b;

i dont know what to do. do i go for it? risk rejection and ruining our professional relationship? do i give up my career for him if he says yes? i dont think i could continue this if i was with him personally. do i just keep silent and continue our relationship as is? or do i drop him as a client altogether? i was never looking for a guy to ""save me"" but i cant help what i'm feeling for him.

edit 3 i'm about to leave for lunch with him. i'm not going to bring it up yet but i do intend to ask him if he ever sees himself getting married again. thanks for all the support. i didn't expect to see this much support.

edit 4 lunch was nice. we had a good time. i did ask him if he felt like he could ever be married again. he said 3 years ago the answer would be a hard no but now he wasn't so sure. then he asked me if i ever saw myself getting married and i had a similar answer, i told him i asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my place tonight, not work, personal. he said he's like that. i'm going for it.

well i truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. i didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. i really didn't expect all the support i got. i was flooded with comments, pms and chat requests. some were about what i expected. accusations of gold digger, and ""cant turn a hoe into a housewife"" type comments thats really the response i expected. what i didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. you were all right in that i did know what i really wanted. i did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push i needed to not waste anymore time. shoot your shot right?

&#x200b;

i'd like to address a few things before i get into the update

&#x200b;

a few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. i was pretty sure he wasn't married i did out-calls to his home and my married clients never take me to their home always a hotel. but i was regularly in his home, i saw the pictures of her around the house i know she was real. 

&#x200b;

how can i trust a guy who uses escorts? well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what i do. i cant imagine judging a man for using my service. i was his first too and unless hes a good actor i know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. i never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business. 

&#x200b;

i should wait for him to approach me. unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. as the lines became blurred i did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous i had to drop. i am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. i had to be the one to make this move

&#x200b;

do i want to do this forever/do i really want to give it up? different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. some in favor some against. bottom line is i don't think i see myself doing this into my 30's. it used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets i look forward to anymore are the ones with him. i also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. i heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but i just cant. even if he would be ok with it i just cant. another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what i do. shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

&#x200b;

a lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our ""working"" relationship. i imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so i'll put it here. we have been. for some time now. we meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. we also text throughout the week. 

&#x200b;

ok on to the update. i think i left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. this was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. i posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. he said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. then he followed up with a question about if i would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. and i sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. he had to go back to work by this point and i invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. he has never been to my home. i dont bring clients back there only friends. i hoped that sent a strong signal to him. 

&#x200b;

i went back home and started getting ready, i had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. i called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more ""normal"" i told her about the reddit post and said i was making the jump. i also let her know i wanted to take her up on her offer. i called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. i said something had come up and i wouldn't be available. i'm out. i'm done regardless of what happened with him if i cant get my head in the game anymore and i'm getting too personal, plus now i am realizing i want to be in a relationship and i cant separate sex from my feelings like i thought, its time to call it. this isn't what i want anymore. this choice was for me not him. even if things didn't work out with him i realized i really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. one thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when i told him. i honestly didn't believe he would but i asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. she knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

&#x200b;

i got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. he came by at around 7. he had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. i invited him. he said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. i told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. i dont bring clients to my home. i was really hoping he was getting the hint. dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but i could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. so i put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and ""shoot my shot"" as you all put it. i told him i was dropping him as a client. he looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? what did he do wrong? did something happen. i assured him it want about him. i was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. i told him about the job i took and he wished me good luck, he said i was attractive and charming and he was sure i would do well in sales. he said he was going to miss me. i took a big deep breath and said. ""you dont have to miss me if you dont want to"" and then i spilled it. he was the only client i brought home to tell in person. i laid it all out all the things i mentioned in the post. how i felt about him and how i didnt want to be his escort anymore. i wanted to be his girlfriend. i said i understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now i was asking to stick around and i would understand if he didnt want to continue on. he said who told you that? that he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. he said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. he was still hurt over his wife and that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. he asked me if i was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. i told him i could work with it and that i wasn't trying to replace her. we kissed. i led him into my bedroom and we made love. 

&#x200b;

we spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. he offered to help me make the transition but i told him i wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. i appreciated his offer and if i needed the help i would ask but i need to do try on my own at first. he respected that. i told him that things would change now. as his gf i would have expectations of him i never had as an escort. he was ok with that. i told him i never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now i wanted monogamy i would give it and i wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and i reminded him i dropped my clients. he said that wasn't a problem. i was the only one. he spent the night with me and left this morning.

 

&#x200b;

where is this going to lead us next? i have no idea. maybe i am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was god working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. i'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. my whole life has drastically changed in just a day. i didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it. 

&#x200b;

to everyone who said i was a worthless whore who could never be loved, fuck you too, to everyone who expressed concern thank you, maybe this is a mistake but i have to find out, to everyone who encouraged me to go for it thank you, you were right, without the thousands of responses to go for it i would have languished in that limbo for a lot longer. 

&#x200b;

as a final thought i want to say that this isn't normal. if you see sex workers please dont see think this is the norm and that the women you see may also fall in love with you. while i'm sure it happens and ive heard from others who were in similar positions to mine its really not the norm. if you're considering sex work because you think you can find prince charming know this outcome is very unusual. oh and i hated pretty woman btw. i never thought it would be me one day.

"by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.. obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

i had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. i proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! or so i thought. 

about 3 weeks after our proposal, i notice she starts acting different. not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. she had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of m-f each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. i went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when i have work the next day, so i often opted out.

we would also share our google location with each other at all times. mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and i would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. i looked at her location one day and it was turned off. i texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. hadn't been a problem for the past year. she turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. she also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. i only had the location for the personal phone. eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

two days ago, about a month after the proposal, i decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and i just wanted to put it to rest. i used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. she had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. i called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. she said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

i waited until she got home and confronted her about it. she said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought i would get mad. turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. i kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time i asked.

the next day when i got home from work, i asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. she said she deleted them. so i said i wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. i started recovering the data from the last backup. she sat down beside me while i was doing it, and asked what i was doing. i told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! so she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. i asked her one last time, ""before i look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" she was silent. i asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. so that's a win i guess.

planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. havn't told her yet. still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. feels shitty but i'm keeping my head up.

tldr; by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. it has been one month since the proposal now.

"for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?. i know from the title, it definitely sounds like i would be the asshole but please hear me out. i have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. my nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (i don't know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. the first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. he drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. my wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. he told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

this weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. his mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. he got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. when my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. i stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. here's the part where i may be the asshole. i told my cousins i didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and i know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. i told them i couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. i apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. they didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

i guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that i should've been more understanding and that i was wrong to ask them to leave. 

am i the asshole?

edit for added info: 

thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. there's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when i saw how many had reached out to me), but i wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. the first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. my dad is an only child so the cousin i refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). i'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). the reason i refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. a lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, i don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. i apologize if it was misleading in my post. without being specific, in the western state i was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. i call him my nephew because my cousin and i were close and i still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though i don't know how after this situation). 

2. some have asked if i was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. the first time, i thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. remember, in my mind he's my nephew and i never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. regarding the situation that happened this weekend, i was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. i didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. i don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but i don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",3

"by accidentally asking my wife's sister for a three way.. this fuck up mainly involves three people me m32, my wife f27 and her sister f25.

so for context a normal saturday is for my wife and i to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

this week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

so off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our saturdays.

as we are about to leave her sister says ""have fun"" in a cheeky way which i completely don't pick up on.

my brain decides that as my wife and i spent thursday together for valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

so straight after the ""have fun"" and without consulting my wife, i say ""you can tag along if you like""

the atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and i'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so i double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""as you said it will be fun"".

my wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when i've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

i've apologised and explained. i know we will laugh about it later but for now i'm playing lego lotr on my own. 

tl:dr i asked my wife's sister for a three way without realising sisters talk about the things they do.

edit: well this post went nuclear! oh and thanks for the golds kind strangers. 

a couple of things i'd like to address, many of you seem to think its bad we don't spend saturday with our kids. well i work from home 4 days a week and my wife is a stay at home mom. our kids are not yet school age so it's nice for us to have time as a couple on a saturday.

yes, i spelt invite as invight, oh well.

"as a former car salesman, these are the common fallacies that people used to justify purchasing a new car.. there are 4 basic reasons people came in to purchase a car.

current car is messy:
i sold a ton of cars to people who's current car they hated simply because it was dirty. some elbow grease or paying for a good detail could have saved them $20k.

wanted new technology:
i sold $50k cars weekly because of bluetooth capabilities. no matter how old your car is, you can add this to any existing car for around $200. cheaper if your diy.

wanted it as a status symbol:
cars always look amazing at a dealership where they are waxed, clean, and smothered in armor all and tire shine. in two weeks the difference between your old car and your new car will probably be negligible. the whole status symbol thing really only lasts a few weeks. most of your peers don't know the difference between a new and much older models if they are both dirty.

mechanical problems:
this is the only reason i would advise anyone to purchase a car. eventually the repairs get to the point where its more expensive to keep it than to move on. if you are buying a car for anyother reason than this... don't!

edit: reading the comments, i figured i should address some general thoughts. 

safety isn't something i meantioned before, but probably should have. regardless of how reliable a car is, if you are driving something with a rusted frame and 20 year old safety features its time to upgrade (assuming you can afford it). my wife and kids drive in a 5 star crash rating car with every modern safety feature. we have chose to be stingy in other places in our finances so we can afford to have a car with these types of features. its worth a little bit of money to us to know our family is safe and to be able to see when backing out of the driveway. 

that moment when repairs out way the cost of upgrading is tricky. i have been burned several times by spending money on repairs that i thought were a good investment only to have more and more repairs pile up. i wish i knew some perfect rule for this. i don't. i have repaired cars i shouldn't have and i have gotten rid of cars that probably would have been great with minor investments.

"update i take prescription medication for adhd. started a new job and drug test collection site released a preliminary result to employer of me failing drug test. company rescinded job offer despite a clean result from lab. left old job for new one and now i'm unemployed.. link to original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms\_i\_take\_prescription\_medication\_for\_adhd/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8u3pzg/tnms_i_take_prescription_medication_for_adhd/)

i am surprised how quickly this situation was resolved.

i met with an attorney for a consultation thursday. after talking and explaining my situation, she told me this strikes a nerve and hits very close to home with her because her husband and one of her kids has adhd. i could tell how furious she was by her expressions and mannerisms. she told me that she would contact the company pro bono, but if it came to a lawsuit, she would take it on contingency as i could get punitive damages. i told her i don't want to sue anyone if i don't have to, i just want this job offer back as i have been waiting a long time for a job like this. she also explained that if her attempts at contacting the company were unsuccessful, i could file an eeoc charge and go through them before filing a lawsuit with her if needed

ultimately, she told me this is discrimination. due to an unrelated incident a while back, i have an app on my phone that records all phone calls (one-party consent in my state) and saves them to my google drive. i played the calls with my manager to the attorney. when my manager informed me of the preliminary result i explained to her my prescription medication and my adhd. the attorney told me it was good that i disclosed that at the time because now the company can no longer claim they didn't know about my disability, which would be a defense to discrimination (also this is an office job and my meds and adhd would not cause any issues in performing my duties). i was not terminated at this time, just ""suspended"" pending the lab test. the call after my lab test came back, my manager said the offer was rescinded and my employment was being terminated due the preliminary result conflicting with the lab result but i would be paid for my one day of work. as far as not being ""honest"" in my interview regarding the drug test, my attorney feels that is just a smoke screen. any reasonable person would think that question is being asked specifically to illegal substances so essentially we don't waste each other's time if i knew i would fail. i had no obligation to disclose any legally prescribed medications.

i asked about the collection site (apparently the collection site is not directly affiliated with the lab, they just have a contract with the lab to analyze the samples they collect) disclosing the preliminary result and she said she wasn't sure if they did anything illegal because i signed a release before providing my urine sample and this is a separate issue, but she thinks an argument can be made for negligence. she would check up on it because she is not 100&#37; familiar with collection sites releasing preliminary results in lieu of a lab test. she said that if it was a positive test for a substance that had no legitimate medical purpose, then ""maybe"" they would be ok releasing that but even still, dipping some strips in urine is not a certified or accredited test. she said ultimately the point of having a lab test and mro is to remove all potential variables of a false positive and the point of the mro is to have someone that is knowledgeable with what can cause a positive result and that can analyze if that positive result is valid or not, to prevent sending false positive results back. if it comes down to a lawsuit, she would name the collection company as part of it, but ultimately this is about the company discriminating.

anyway, my attorney called me the next day saying she had a conference call with the head of hr and their legal department. when she initially talked to the head of hr, he had been on vacation when all this went down and he had no knowledge of my situation and would look into it and get back to her. he called her back with legal on the line and they decided to re-offer me my job and pay me for all the time missed. my attorney goes on to say they want to have a conference call with me present and if i could come into her office that afternoon. i agreed.

when i was at her office for the conference call, those present on the call were the head of hr, legal department, my manager, my attorney, and myself. essentially this call was an apology to me. the head of hr profusely apologized for this. he went on to tell me that this decision was made by someone new in hr and despite the head being on vacation, he always makes himself available to his employees and he should have been consulted at the very least. if he had known about this, he would have gone with the lab result and we would have never been in this situation. he went on to say that he talked with the rep that decided to rescind my offer, and although he was apologetic, the head of hr felt that the rep did not fully understand the legal position he put the company in and he is no longer employed with the company. they want me to come back in monday (tomorrow) to continue my employment. he stated that my manager spoke very highly of my qualifications and interview and they ""want nothing more than a person with my background on their team."" he even said he would treat me and my manager to lunch monday.

he told me that they will give me a private office to accommodate my adhd. i told them that wasn't necessary as i am perfectly capable of performing my job in a cubicle, like everyone else, but he insisted.

so now i have my job back, getting back pay, have a private office, and being treated to lunch by the head of hr. i owe much thanks to this community for all the advice and support you have given me. i wish i could personally shake hands with all of you. i was so scared before reading your comments. thank you, thank you, thank you!!!

edit: i'm going to disclose my medication. i take vyvanse. a lot of people assume i'm taking adderall. i used to take adderall but my doctor suggested i try vyvanse when it came out. although similar and made by the same company, vyvanse is a much better medication for me. the release is more controlled, it's not as ""intense"" as adderall, my appetite is not affected, i sleep much better with it, and it doesn't give me the ""crash"" that adderall does when wearing off.

"(update) school wants my son's facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. wtf? florida. this is an update to this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

i went to school and asked what's going on. i did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

first, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. second, the principal explained the situation to me. it had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

when i asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. i asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

i told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. i told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat i'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

i talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. he only knew that she had left the school. he showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

in short: they backed off after i made sure they understood that i won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. i will try talking to them to make sure. they deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at.

"for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?. train is packed, it's hot, i'm tired and looking for a place to sit. everything was occupied, but at one point i see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. i went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. i asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. i noticed she had headphones in, so i figured i'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as i'm sitting down.

as soon as i touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck i was doing. i explained. she then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. i told her i knew for a fact she was alone because i just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. so i started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

this released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. i saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so i figured i'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""oh i'm sorry, i didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. my bad, i'll get up now"". i got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as i was walking away.

i noticed some people gave me dirty looks, but others were chuckling, so i kinda wondered if i stepped too much out of line there.",3
"alcohol is overrated and drinking in general is not that fun.. i personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me i personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. i never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am i missing something ?

and before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends i doubt that since i have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. hes probably part of the reason i dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

im trying not to come off as someone saying im holier than thou, this is just something i couldn't understand why its as popular as it is.

(not part of my opinion just a bit of detail and a big old thank you to the awesome community!)

the daughter replied, ""i'm 35 and still living at home with my parents and this is the closest i'll ever get to a husband.""

later that week the father was in the kitchen and heard a humming sound coming from the basement. 
when he went downstairs, he found his daughter naked on the sofa with her vibrator. 

""what are you doing?"" he exclaimed.

the daughter replied, ""i'm 35 and still living at home with my parents and this is the closest i'll ever get to a husband.""

in there, she found her husband watching the super bowl on television with the vibrator buzzing away beside him.

"as a reaction to butt worms (almost certainly nsfw). this is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.

also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

for background: at some point in my childhood, i developed pin-worms. in the interest of science, i must admit that i don't know for certain that i had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that i had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

i'm afraid that i don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all i remember is that as a young child i walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and i don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

fast forward a decade and a half: i am living on my own. single. re-acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone i am still close to refers to as ""she-who-must-not-be-named"". i don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....i had worms. my butt was beyond-normally itchy. sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. the confirmation came when i showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

i hoped they would go away. i showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. but every morning, i would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

i was horrified, but i made an appointment at my local clinic. when i told the nurse over the phone that i thought i had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. she said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

i went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly south-east indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

i was already frustrated, but i waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. later i drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before i would get results.

in the meantime, i remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.

i would like to say that as a liberal american male, i wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that i did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, i dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what i had done.

now to add: i had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. we had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; i wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and i found ourselves showering. my hand drifted down to my butt-crack and i realized i \*needed\* to share my story with her, despite fears that i would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. so i spurted it out: ""uhm, so yeah, i...uh...think i have butt worms....""

she was so practical about it. she asked to see. i pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""see,"" i said, embarrassed. ""worms.""

...

""that's toilet paper"", she replied.

""w...what?""

""yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""that's toilet paper.""

everything fell into place. about a month ago, when finances got tight, i swapped my normal tp roll with dollar store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after i wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

my relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . my shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

tldr: i spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because i bought cheap toilet paper.

"serious just a reminder to be careful when telling jokes that may be offensive.. a few days ago i was talking to some friends, and friends of those friends, at a bar.

i decided to break the ice with the new friends with a few jokes, most of which went down very well...until i decided to tell a few more offensive ones...and picked the worst possible one to start with.

here's the joke i told:

""what do you do if you see an epileptic having a fit in the bath?

throw your washing (laundry if you're american) in.""

one of the new friends instantly became enraged and swung for me. when i asked him what the hell his problem was he replied that his younger brother was epileptic and died in the bath many years ago.

obviously i felt mortified as i didn't know about it, and said ""i'm so sorry to hear that. did he drown?""

"new york- mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while i was babysitting 4 year old step sister. hi folks

i'm a 21 year old college student. my parents separated soon after i was born, and my my mom raised me alone until i was 15. she met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister eliza. she's grown up with me, and i often baby sit for her for short periods of time. i live with a roomate in apartments owned by the college

late last week, my stepfather's mom died. he's polish, so my mom and he left for poland leaving me to babysit eliza for a week. yesterday, i got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in poland. i've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

i have no idea what to do. my biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. my mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the usa that i am aware of. i'm studying political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but i have no job and no salary. 

eliza has no family other than me that i can turn to. i'm not ready to take of a child, but i also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and i've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. but we also look very different- my dad is jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. so i'm a tall, mixed race dude while eliza is a small blonde girl (i bring this up because i was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

so what do i do? i'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and i haven't even told eliza yet. it just hit me that we're now alone, and i now have to step up to the plate and take care of eliza. i have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

edit: thank you for all you advice. i apologize if i do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

edit 2: thank you to everybody who has offered to send me financial support. however, i am currently ok, and my mom's friends, and my college friends have kindly offered to help me out, and i also have a little bit saved up. but i greatly appreciate your generosity",2

"no regrets after a briefly successful suicide attempt 8 months ago, i visited the bathroom i died in and words cannot express how grateful i am to be alive right now.. on june 27th 2017 i intentionally overdosed on heroin in the handicap stall of the ladies' room in oglivie transportation center. and it worked. i was found with no pulse and not breathing. for months i resented the fact that i was brought back. i laid awake every night sobbing, abusing every drug i could get my hands on, and even attempted suicide two more times but to no avail. 

since then i met the love of my life, and she makes me want to stay sober. i want to remember every moment i spend with her. she proposed to me a bit over a month ago and i want to live as long as possible so that i can grow old with her. on our first date we went to a protest, and got cold so entered the first building we saw. it was ogilvie. we ate panda express and had our first kiss there. i didn't even realize it at the time but she gave me life in the building where i had almost successfully taken my life. yesterday we went back there and i showed her exactly where i died. i am almost 5 months clean now and am so fucking happy that i was given another chance at life.

the road leading here was rocky, but i'm grateful for every bump along the way because this was the road that lead me to her. that's not to say the road isn't still bumpy, but we have each other to ride it out with. 
we've had some devastating financial hardships recently and are homeless. but home is where the heart is. home is holding hands and laughing at our situation from a bus stop bench. home is cuddling up in an alley to stay warm in 0° weather. it's kind of funny that now i want to live, and i have to worry about surviving. this is a new feeling. it's stressful,  but i'm happy. the only tears i've been crying lately are happy ones.

edit: i'm not depending my life and sobriety on one other person, i was already on medication, sober, in therapy and on the right track when i met her. she just makes me extra grateful for life because i didn't think love would ever be an option for me and she supports me and my healthy goals.",11

"update(az) our neighbor's dog was apparently poisoned and because we had complained about the dog barking, police wanted to go through our ""internet history."". original here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/a75f0o/az_our_neighbors_dog_was_poisoned_police_want_to/

>edit: hey guys i'm involved in the discussion at best of legal advice, a lot of good questions in dm but it would sure be easier if i could just answer them once. i'm sorry but since this is still potentially a legal and civil issue, i really don't want to say where i am and my attorneys name. all the laws i found regarding barking ordinances were on google. 

so thank you to everyone who responded. and i guess thank you to everyone in the dms who accused me of torturing dogs by forcing the owners to keep them inside because god forbid, i want to sleep in my own house. just to allay the fears of the other nice dm's, i did not in any way shape or form hurt the dog. also a legit thank you to everyone who offered tips on anti-bark devices, the problem is these people aren't next door to us (which goes to show how loud the dogs are) so we don't have the ability to set up any sort of device. 

i took the advice of 99.9% of the posters and did not call the officer back on monday night. i also showed my wife this thread and she was pretty convinced so thank you for all the rational responses. i called a criminal defense attorney first thing yesterday morning. 

he was very cool and said that he didn't want to waste our time any money because the chances of the da actually pursuing this were slim to none. he did tell me to not answer any more questions and if the police did come for me again, i could refer them to him or if god forbid they arrested me, he gave me the number of his answering service. he said that he had a good friend who worked as detective and he'd try put a call in to figure out ""off the record"" what was really going on. 


so basically nothing happened yesterday (of course the other dogs are still barking, even as i type this) but i just heard (wednesday morning) from the attorney  and basically he had talked to his detective friend who looked into it. basically regardless of what the neighbors say, there is actually zero evidence of them owning three dogs. in fact the best evidence that the now dead dog ever existed were my calls to animal control, the mediation records and the judges ruling. the people could not provide any pictures, social media posts, any shot records, vet bills or purchase receipts for any of the dogs, let alone one that died. they also had not done any sort of medical exam to prove the dog had been poisoned and they immediately buried the dog in the desert when they found it dead (for all i know they buried the dog instead of taking to the vet, they are the trashiest people i've ever encountered). the can't even really remember where they buried it (or don't want to say). so with almost no evidence of the dog ever existing, let alone being poisoned we shouldn't hear from the police again. 

so our complaint to animal control from last thursday is still on the books. the lawyer is going to refer us to a civil attorney who he thinks will take our case to bring a civil suit against the dog owners. our city and county ordinances  very clearly state that dogs can't bark for more than 15 minutes a day and you have the right to an expectation of quiet in your own home. the criminal lawyer doesn't know how successful we'll be but he does think that maybe the threat of lawsuit will get them to address the barking problem, because it would be easier them to just bring the dogs inside as opposed to a court case which they stand a chance of losing.

"taylor swift has a victim mentality. she is not a role model, she is a ""mean girl"" bully in disguise and everyone is falling for it.. **update** on the situation if you care. this(https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.etonline.com/big-machine-records-offices-shut-down-due-to-threats-amid-taylor-swift-feud-136467%3famp) article says that big machine had to shut down their office yesterday because taylor fans were sending death threats. the article also quotes a label exec saying: 

> taylor can 100 percent perform all of her catalog, past and present, at the amas. big machine has no issue with her performance going out on live broadcast because it recognizes it doesn't have the right to block her. labels can't block any artists from performing any songs live.

so take it however you will. lots of cool and differing opinions in here and i've enjoyed reading them. thanks for participating you guys 💕

(**original post below here**)

have a feeling this is going to be an unpopular post, because regarding the recent news(https://twitter.com/taylorswift13/status/1195123215657508867) about taylor's record label dispute, reddit has been overwhelmingly in support of her.

taylor swift is always playing the victim. almost all of her songs are about how some boy came along and broke her heart, and how tragic that is because she was a perfect angel girlfriend and he was the absolute devil.

example. she put joe jonas(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amh859mneki) on blast over their breakup. told everyone on ellen that he broke up with her in a 20 second phone call. but joe jonas came out and said that the only reason the phone call was so short was because *she* hung up on him.

ok, but she was only 19 with this happened. surely she's grown and changed as a person since then?

nope. i'm not gonna link sources because you can find them easily on google, but she continues to have relationships like this. they end bitterly and she writes a song or makes a snarky public comment about how awful her ex is. examples:  john mayer, calvin harris, harry styles, jake gyllenhaal.

look at her feuds with other celebrities. kanye and katy perry are kind of insane, but she's fought with many others: rihanna, miley cyrus, tina fey, amy poehler, the list goes on.

look at how she defends herself in all of these situations. she has literally told lies (ex: the kanye west debate and the joe jonas thing) to paint a better portrait of her as the victim.

and didn't she lie about her masters situation when the news first broke, too? didn't it come out that taylor did know about the deal and did have the opportunity to buy her masters, but she passed it up?? it seems she had the power to stop this from ever happening in the first place.

now she's posting some pretty big accusations of him publicly, but she has nothing to back up her claims. she is literally asking her fans to brigade someone and have blind faith that what she's saying about him is completely true.

it definitely could be true. and i do feel bad for her if that's the case.

but she's a 30 year old grown ass woman. worth half a billion dollars. she could afford the best attorneys in the world to take this guy down. but she decides to vent on twitter and ask her teenage fans to attack someone based on her word alone (which has historically been unreliable). i get that people think this is an important message to spread. but the way she worded it sure seemed like it wasn't about spreading awareness so much as it was about getting revenge.

taylor swift reminds me of a high schooler. her ""squad"" is a clique and she is their regina george. she has a pattern of unstable relationships and an inability to see her own flaws in them.

taylor seems to think everyone else is the problem. nah taylor, you're the problem. the common factor in all these situations is you.

oh and her music sucks.",6
"because i ate more than ""my share"" of a 6 foot party sub last night?. what i thought would be a total non issue has ballooned into a huge problem and i'm up at 7:05 am dealing with it. i figured while i wait for a text, i could post here to see if what i did was really that bad. 

i'm a big fat ass, there's no way around it. i love to eat which probably borders on addiction but i figure since i'm only hurting myself it's probably better to just live my life. i have some great friends although there is no doubt i'm the ""harmless, funny token fat guy"" of the otherwise pretty good looking group. i guess that sets the stage enough. 

last night my friend hosted ufc and i was invited. he got a 6 foot party sub. i also brought homemade wings that are sort of my specialty. well of course people flocked to the food and i had basically one serving of the sandwich but people devoured my wings and i didn't get to have a single one. which is totally fine that's why i brought them but maybe an hour later i was starving. i kept eyeing the sandwich and i'd say there was about 3 feet of it left. i waited an hour, then another half hour and no one had touched it (but they were still munching on chips, pretzels and what not). so i was like screw it...i took about half of what was left and ate it. then the last half sat for another 10-15 minutes and no one said anything so ate the rest. 

well to be sure as i was swallowing the last bite the host's girlfriend asked where the sandwich was. like i was the guilty party pretty much everyone pointed at me. i guess they'd noticed me eating the sandwich. she was furious and said that i was an incredible pig and that i had been super selfish to eat 3 feet of a sandwich. i felt so bad i tried to explain to her that i really did wait over an hour and thought people had lost interest. i also tried to explain how everyone had ate my wings and she said something along the lines of ""you brought them to share alan, if someone had eaten over half by themselves that's not fucking sharing is it?"" 

i offered to order pizza or even go get subways and she said that it was a pathetic offer because the party sub had been from a local shop owned by her friends. i said i was sorry but the night was so tense from then on out. 

i woke up this morning to several texts from my twin sisters (the host's girlfriend's best friends) saying that i had to get my shit under control and that everyone is really mad at me and that i embarrassed myself last night. i tried to explain to them what my mindset had been and they haven't responded. 

was i the asshole for eating that much of the sandwich last night?

edit: i guess i've been banned from responding but my inbox has 1200 notification so i can't find out why.

to answer what seems to be the most common misconception, this wasn't a subway party sub so definitely not 4x the size of a regular sub. this is a local place so it's about 1.5 times the width of a regular sub. its still a ton of food don't get me wrong but i can down 5 subway footlongs in an afternoon easily; this is probably about equivalent to that, not 12 like some people are saying.",3

"us, ok disgruntled neighbor has installed a strobe light to stop epileptic kids from using a school bus stop.. to give some context on where we live: we're in a small neighborhood of about 5 homes; it's a very small cul-de-sac area in the middle of farmland. there aren't other homes or buildings for about 2 miles.

i have 3, young, elementary aged children that all have a very serious case of epilepsy: it does not take much to cause an episode. by some luck, two of our neighbor's kids also have epilepsy, and are also around the same age as our kids. for the past few years they have been able to successfully group together and go to the end of our community to catch the bus.

the family who used to own the house at the street recently moved out, and there is a new owner who has been an absolute hell to everyone. from the second day on, he has harassed our kids telling them to get off his property, even though they were technically on a public road. through the grapevine he somehow learned that a majority of the kids were epileptic, and has installed strobe lights in his front lawn. these are very powerful, very fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

we've contacted the police, and they won't even come out to talk to the guy. we've contacted the school to see if they could come into the neighborhood to pick up our kids, and they really can't: the bus just couldn't drive into our neighborhood and easily back out. they have to be picked up on the street.

what can we do?

"i f25 received a letter from my mother f49 yesterday in the mail. i've never cried harder.. so around a week ago i posted on reddit that i was having issues with my mother. my husband and i took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. we are now working on adopting them. she has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. so i decided to take a step back from her.

i've been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. it broke my heart and i broke down in tears. probably the most i've cried in so long.

it was such a heartbreaking letter. she said that ""i was a worthless space of a human"" and that ""those kids would be better off in foster care then with me"". it was a full page of just insults. the one that really got to me was ""you've never accomplished anything and you've never made me proud"". i broke down that line. throughout my life all i wanted was to make her proud.

i ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. i'm glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. i talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. he truly is my rock.

i truly can't believe my mother would do such a hurtful thing. it broke me down but now i have to pick myself up. i fully think this would be enough for me to cut her out of my life forever. does anyone have any advice? anyone ever cut a parent out forever?",7

every sunday, for about 2 hours, i cook and cook and cook. i make sure i make enough for my fiance and i to have lunches for the entire week. that's all it takes, two hours!  and like $40 in groceries. when i was really struggling for money, i would still find myself going out to lunch every single day and spending $10-$15 a meal. that's $50-$75 a week!  now i cook for two people for less than that. 

just a little advice and personal success here - meal prep your heart out and your wallet will thank you. 

edit: wow!  did not know how popular this would get. i can't keep up with replying to posts so i'll address two common comments here. 

1 - a lot of people keep bringing up the point that the ""cost"" of my time is not worth the meal prep and i beg to differ. these two hours i use are two hours that i would just be playing overwatch or something like that. and the money i'm saving can work for me in paying off debts and investing, so personally it's my best option.  i realize this doesn't work for everyone. i also can't take the easy way out with $5 boxes at taco bell or something similar as my body doesn't tolerate gluten which cuts out most fast food options. 

2 - every week i go to aldi and stock up on brown rice, black beans, corn, ground turkey or tofu, a bag of chicken and some veggies. most common meal prepped is burrito bowls. which is 1 pound of ground turkey, 2 cans of beans, 1 can corn, 1 jar of salsa, and brown rice mixed with cumin, chili powder, garlic powder and coriander. makes 12 cups of food at 1,220 calories total. i divide this up into six 2 cup containers. then usually make chicken with veggies or gluten free pasta for the remaining two days of meals for us. utilizing four burners, a stove, and a microwave all at once produces a surprising amount of food very quickly. i store it all in tupperware for the week and it stays well. some people recommend prepping and freezing as well. are there some days where i dread eating the same meal and eat out?  heck yes, but it's not every day like it used to be. and my wallet and waistline has rewarded me greatly for that.

"because i refuse to go and visit my special needs stepsister in hospital even though she's very sick? i low key hate her.. i'm 15 years old. i have a stepsister who is a couple years older than me and she is really seriously disabled. i'm not sure what's wrong with her because no one ever wants to discuss it with me but she's non verbal, breaks her bones a lot, and has severe epilepsy and will have many fitting episodes. she also doesn't understand stuff. that's probably the easiest way to put it. she's just a human body with nothing inside. 

she's my stepmoms daughter. my stepmom married my dad 3 years ago and they dated only for a year before that. i don't know my stepmom very well and i don't really get on with her. we are respectful to each other but i'm basically living with strangers because she's so busy with her daughter and my dad. i am always on my own and i used to hate it but i'm used to it now.

ever since they moved in to live with us life changed drastically for me because all the care now revolves around my stepsister. that's fine, i get it, but both my stepmom and my dad ask me to do things for my stepsister that i don't want to do and i resent doing. stuff like staying home when i want to go to the mall with my friends, they're disappointed that i don't get her anything for her birthday with my very limited funds, etc. 

my own mom passed away when i was small so i can't go and stay anywhere else and all in all i'm just a lot more angry than i used to be because they seem really disappointed whenever i say i don't want to do anything for her. even stuff like feeding her- like- i don't want to sit there feeding her banana pudding and wiping her drool. i didn't ask for this. 

anyway, she recently fell a few days ago and had a seizure for 8 minutes. she was taken to hospital and the doctors want to keep her in and look after her. i don't want to go and visit her. i remember seeing my mom in hospital before she died and i just hate hospitals and i sort of hate my stepsister and i just don't want to go and visit someone who doesn't even know i'm there. 

my stepmom is really upset with me and so is my dad. they haven't yelled at me or anything but they are both being super cold towards me because i don't want to visit. my grandma who lives in canada called me up out the blue and told me it was okay and i don't need to force myself to go to the hospital so i'm assuming my dad has told her i'm refusing to go. he keeps pleading with me but i keep telling him i'm not doing it. i told him hospitals remind me of mom and he got even more upset and said my stepsister might die and i need to stop being so selfish towards my stepmom.

---------------actual update---------------

after the post i decided it would be best to end things through a phone call. i mentioned ghosting, but it's probably best he knows how and why he fucked up. i waited until saturday to reach out to him, told him ""we need to talk."" i'm paraphrasing here, but this is basically what the convo went like:

dan: this is about the dinner, isn't it?

me: yeah it is. 

dan: and?

me: i don't think i've ever felt so unwelcome in a group before. it felt like a shitty interview, all they did was test my knowledge. no one tried to get to know 
me, and when actual conversation was going on i was ignored or interrupted if i tried to talk. 

dan: i don't feel it like it was anything like that.

me: ok, so how often do you guys sit around just asking questions like ""quick - what is the sql query if you want to delete two rows from two different tables!?!"" 

dan: i don't know

me: no really, do you quiz your friends randomly like that at work or out and about? 

dan: no not really

me: and why not? why don't you just ask lightning round quizzes like that? b/c it's not what normal people do?

dan: i don't know. they were just having fun and joking around.

me: it wasn't fun for me. i have male and female friends in all sorts of professions, i've never cornered any of them to test their knowledge. i trust they know 
what they're doing. i ask them about work, what they're doing, you know normal questions. 

dan: ok

me: i'm not going to print out a cpa exam and quiz my accountant friend, don't you think that would be a little fucked up? 

dan: i don't know, maybe? 



we talked a little more about that night, and i gave him more specific examples of what he and his friends did and he never really had any good answered. it was a lot of ""i don't know"" and single word answers. i told him i created a reddit post and i would send it to him. he was a little pissed off that i did that, felt like i had no right to so. at the end of the conversation he asked if we were done. i told him yeah, that i can't see a future with him, that i saw a different side of him that night and i don't want to be someone's prize poodle on display for the world to see. he didn't really say anything after that and just hung up the phone. i sent him the url for my first post. 



he texted me throughout the weekend, but i didn't respond. he read the post that i sent him and wasn't happy with it, and said he couldn't believe so many people were on my side and were hating on him. he sent a few more angry texts after that like he couldn't believe we were breaking up over something so stupid. he did send a few rounds of ""i'm sorrys"" and ""let's try to work through this"" but when i didn't respond he just went back to angry texting me. 



also, i did find his friend who buried his head in his phone that night and sent him the reddit link and asked if that sounded like what happened. dan's friend said he knew what his friends were doing were wrong, and felt bad for me. he apologized for not stepping in, and assumed that dan would eventually speak up for me on my behalf. he also apologized for joining them in the beginning, and wished me luck in my career. 



tl:dr: i tried explaining how that night was weird, uncomfortable and fucked up. he didn't see my point of view, didn't learn any lessons from it. i broke it off, he has been sending me angry texts, i haven't responded.

"for wanting my daughter's boyfriend/soon-to-be fiance to know her dark secret before marriage?. i'm the dad of a 25 year old young woman who i love very much. i've been able to have a good relationship with my daughter and i enjoy my time with her, but there's one thing about her that would give many people pause - she is a diagnosed sociopath.

she exhibited odd, disturbing behavior at a young age, and after a serious incident of abuse towards her younger sister, i realized she needed professional help. throughout her elementary years she struggled heavily, getting in lots of trouble in school for lying, cruelty and all other types of misbehaviors. with an enormous amount of therapy & support, her bad behavior was minimized as she grew older. she received an aspd diagnosis at 18, and i had suspected it for long prior.

after her aggressive behavior was tamed, her following years were much more fruitful. she's law-abiding; has a decent job and a good education; and has many good friendships and admirers. especially male admirers; she is very, very charming and adept at attracting guys and maintaining their interest. she uses that old dating guide ""the rules"" like a bible. she currently has a boyfriend of about a year and a half who's crazy about her, and who i have a very strong relationship with (we live in the same area and spend time together regularly). he is a **great** guy, very kind, funny and intelligent.

but i doubt she loves him. we've had some very honest, in-depth discussions about her mental health since her diagnosis, and she's been open with me that she doesn't feel love or empathy towards anyone, even family. when she acted very sad and broken up over the death of one of her closest friends at the funeral, she confessed to me privately that it was all a put-on, and that she felt ""pretty neutral"" about the whole thing. she has also stated she has never once felt guilty about anything she's ever done, and doesn't know what guilt feels like. while she enjoys being around her boyfriend and is sexually attracted to him, i highly doubt she feels much of anything towards him love-wise.

her boyfriend (who might propose soon) **has** **no idea** about her diagnosis, and she's been very upfront with me that she has no plans to ever tell him, thinking it'll scare him away. i've made it clear to her that she needs to tell him the truth before they marry; that he has the right to know and consider it; **or i will**; to which she always responds, ""i know you wouldn't dare."" i actually would - i really like and respect this young man, and would feel awful keeping this ""secret"" from him, and letting him walk into a marriage without this piece of knowledge.

i'm not trying to sabotage my daughter's future. **maybe** her boyfriend's love of her personality and other aspects is enough that it won't end the relationship. it's his decision to make; but he deserves all the facts. someday he's bound to find out she's a bit ""off""; it can't be kept a secret forever. aita?",3
"i mde a spreadsheet for people who dont know how to budget! ver. 2.0. hey guys! i'm back six months later with a new version of the budgeting spreadsheet i made. earlier this year i posted the spreadsheet i made for myself and it really resonated with people. as i got more and more feedback i found places where i could improve and develop the sheet into something easier to use but still useful. 

you can find pictures of it here(https://imgur.com/a/63lxvuq)

a bit of background on me and why i made this- and also why it's made the way it is. i grew up poor and was never taught about how to handle money. if we had money it was already needed for other things. food, bills, all of the money we had already had a place. this made me get a mentality that if i had money i needed to spend it before something came up and the money would go. it's unhealthy, but it was the only thing i knew until i moved out. i was taught that money would disappear if i didn't use it, so i just used it. even now i still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if i'm not careful. 

&#x200b;

another problem i faced is that i have adhd, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. this spreadsheet is made so you only focus on one number. 

&#x200b;

i have made this sheet- and previous versions of it- with three goals in mind:

* that it be easy to use
* that i can focus on one daily number while supporting my long term goals
* that it be a good starting place for people who have never had another budget

the sheet is divided into a few different tools.

budget:

* select your pay schedule, add any extra income/tips that you get monthly and select the percentage of that income that you want to save.
* the credit card section allows you to input up to five cards and adds your monthly car payments to your expenses
* the expenses area is where you'll add all of your itemized expenses. you can also select when your bill is due during the month- allowing you to see if early on in the month your spendable is different from later on in the month. 

your budget summary at the top is the breakdown of all the information below. yes i know pie charts aren't useful for everything- but that is useful to visually digest information. look and see where your money is going, see if you spend more than you earn, and finally- see how much money you can spend.

&#x200b;

this sheet focuses on giving you one number to remember. daily spendable. if you want to spend money throughout the day you just have to make sure you dont go over that number and you will always have enough to cover any other expenses. 

 i don't work well with a lot of budgets because i have issues imagining the big picture. by giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget i can make sure that on any given day i haven't spent more than i'm allowed to- and if i do i can see where i'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

there are a few extra features too- a large purchase calculator that lets you figure how long youd have to save to buy a larger purchase. it includes a monthly tracker that lets you see what youre spending realistically vs what you've budgeted for and finally a daily tracker for further breakdown.

"by kicking my son!. this happened a few weeks ago.

my ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, ""dad! kick me!""

so i did.

hear me out, please. the kick was a 3/10 on firmness. not gentle, but not painful. he's a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he's an only child, i feel like i need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. i also want him to ""lose some battles"", and to learn to ""roll with the punches"". 

anyway... i performed a front kick whilst making the bruce lee noise. i trust that you know the one. 

my son recoiled. he looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. he didn't cry,, but it was close.

he blurted out ""i said kiss me!!!""

oops!

"little sister (16) needs an abortion. texas wants parental consent which we can't get. can i take her to new mexico? (update: it's done). https://redd.it/6m79kf

so it is done. we called an abortion clinic in new mexico and asked for advice. they were very helpful. scheduled an appointment.

i told my parents that i'm taking my sister to go sightseeing in new mexico for 2 days. they never suspected anything so they allowed it and didn't need any convincing. so in the morning i picked her up and we drove to new mexico. we took a few pictures here and there to show later in case someone asked. had the appointment and the procedure done in the afternoon. spent the night at a hotel and drove back to my place the next day. she spent the day and that night at my place. i called my mom at about 11pm and told her that we arrived 15 minutes ago and she's already fallen asleep so i'll bring her there tomorrow.

she was feeling fine by then. so nothing suspicious at all. she's very happy this worked out the way it did and i'm happy that she's happy. i told her that she should not tell anyone about this until at least she is an adult and 100% independent from our parents. you can't really be sure who you can trust so better keep it a secret.

thank you for your advice and the peace of mind that you gave us. once we knew i won't be in legal trouble, we were relaxed and it was easy to arrange everything else. ",2
"my (18f) best friend (18f) cheated on her boyfriend (21m), got pregnant and is lying that he's the dad. should i tell him?. ok this is a crazy rollercoaster. also i know this is pretty fucked up but natalie is a nice girl, she's my best friend. 

we graduated high school this summer so our friends and i all went on a small vacation to italy. we found a groupon thing online so it wasn't too expensive. natalie is dating eric but he didn't come on the trip with us. it was basically a whole bunch of friends from our senior class. it's pretty well known among us friends that dylan who is in our high school, likes natalie. he's like really into her. well when we all went to europe, since eric wasn't there, natalie was all over dylan. acting like a couple, being all flirty. they'd sleep in the same bed but she'd insist nothing was going on and they were just friends. well, i shared a room with natalie and i walked in on them having sex. afterwards i asked her what she was doing since she was dating eric and she said she was on vacation and it was a one time thing. it was not. we were there for a week and they had a ton of sex. dylan's dreams came true that week. but only i knew about it since it was our room. everyone else had their suspicions but i was the only one who really knew the truth. 

when we got back home, she promised me that she was just ""crazy"" since she was on vacation and she'd never cheat on eric again. she kept saying how he was amazing and perfect for her and to please not tell anyone. so i promised to keep her little fling a secret. fucked up i know but i have more loyalty to natalie than eric. 

she continued to act like everything was fine but she recently told me that she's now pregnant and i asked her who the father is and she gave me this look as if i slapped her across the face. she said it's obviously eric and i reminded her about dylan and she insisted that eric is the father and to never mention dylan in front of her again. she's terrified since she was supposed to start college but she told eric and he told her not to worry and he'll take care of her and their baby and he loves her and that they'll be ok. she told me he was a little scared but he begged her not to have an abortion and promised that he's gonna be a good dad. he wants to get married before she starts showing since they both think it looks tacky wearing a wedding dress and being obviously pregnant so she's busy planning a quick wedding too. 

y'all. dylan is obviously the father. like 100%. they were fucking like rabbits in italy and i don't think she knew how to say ""where can i buy condoms"" in italian. i feel bad for eric since he's like.. already buying cute baby clothes and prenatal vitamins and doing research on what she needs to be eating.

i love natalie she's my best friend but this is so fucked up like i feel really bad for eric. i know she's scared and eric would obviously be the better dad but c'mon that's not his baby. dylan is 18 and hes nice but definitely not ready to be a father. eric is older and he's graduating college soon and he has a car and an apartment and hes a good guy. but it's not fair for him. i know she's trying to save her own ass but it's her fault for cheating on him.

i don't know like if i tell eric, natalie will hate me forever for ruiningher life and her baby's life.",7

"how to determine if you can really afford that car. i keep seeing posts where people are struggling with their budget but have some ridiculous car payment. let's have a little discussion for people who are looking to buy a car. here's some advice i'll give. your mileage may vary (oh yes i went there). this advice is in usd but works anywhere. 

don't get stuck holding the bag on a car that depreciates faster than you pay it off. i've done the math at a bunch of different interest rates, and the bottom line is that 48 months is the magic number for loan terms. at 4 years or below, you're typically safe. maybe you can push the boundary at super low interest rates, but there are other reasons not to finance for too long, including risk of financing a used vehicle for longer than expected reliable service life. 

next, write out your full budget and see what you have room for. here's where young folks get trapped: maybe if you're still in school or fresh out of school and have super low living expenses, it will appear like you have tons of room for a fancy car. as soon as you become fully independent with a real place to live and food needs and all that jazz (which will very likely happen within a few years), that magic car budget will vanish before your eyes. be realistic. account for all the standard living expenses, fun budget, savings, and then be honest - what do you really have to spend on transportation each month? for a lot of people, it'll probably be a few hundred bucks. then, subtract what insurance and gas and other associated fees will cost you, and multiply what you're left with by 48. that's what you can afford to finance (including interest!) 

does the number come out well under $10,000 (or equivalent low amount for whatever country you're from)? for many people, it probably does. don't be discouraged, for you can get a great reliable car under ten grand. 

does the number come out to less than $5000? very common! save up and buy a car in cash.

i feel like people tend to look at $20k as cheap for a car, but it's not cheap at all. include taxes and fees, finance over 5 years at 5% and you're looking at well over $400/mo. then tack on insurance (easily $200 for a young driver), and then tack on gas. that $20k car costs you $500-700 per month! if you aren't bringing home $5k+ each month, that probably doesn't fit in your budget. the reality is, even a $20k car is not realistically affordable for the majority of income earners. 

what about $30k+ cars? radio commercials make them sound so affordable, but cars in the $30k-$40k range should be seen as luxury vehicles. we're talking six figure income required. yet, so many people buy $30k suvs and get screwed by the monthly payments. please don't let it happen to you. 

i work in a respectable profession and make a fairly decent wage. people always ask me why i drive a 10 year old car. it's because that's what i can realistically afford! society in general has inflated expectations on what they can afford. it's time to fix this and save people from ruining their budgets.

"for telling my daughter she cannot introduce her african american boyfriend to her grandparents?. let me just preface this by saying this: **i have absolutely no problem with interracial relationships.** now that the air is clear, let me continue. 

my daughter (anna) has recently started to date an african american man (jamal). while i'm not exactly what you would refer to as ""liberal"", he's a nice young man and as long as my daughter is happy, i'm happy. the problem is anna is rather naive about the community she lives in. while her friends are quite content to see a relationship like hers, more than a few tongues are wagging in the community and a few people have privately expressed their concern to me. as i said, i have no problem with mixed relationships and i've set them straight, but i am painfully aware of how these matters are viewed by certain segments of the population.

my parents are planning to come and stay with us for a week and anna expressed a desire to introduce jamal to them now that things were getting more serious between them. i told her on no uncertain terms that this wasn't going to happen. i may have no problem with jamal, but they *absolutely will*, and even when the relationship ends they won't forget it. they might even go as far as to cut her off entirely. anna was extremely upset by this and implied i was a racist and more concerned with what my parents think than how she feels.

as i said, i know my parents. they simply aren't okay with mixed relationships and if anna were to bring jamal over even as a friend, they would be furious both at her *and* me.

anna is currently staying with jamal and doesn't want to speak with me right now. my wife stands by me given she knows very well how my parents are (they had a problem with her for months over the *length of the skirt* she wore when i introduced her to them, for christs sake), but a close friend i confided in told me that i have behaved like an ass and that i needed to focus more on my daughter than pleasing my parents.

no advice needed, but i have to know. have i been an ass?",3

"for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?. this is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

i live on an obscure little island near the uk. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that i appeared on a few years ago. 

the premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. i sailed through a lot of the physical part because i wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so i was ok there.

as for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

i thought of a believable lie before i entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and i put down all the things i'm *not* scared of. i listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. i literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. i grew up in rural landscape and i've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. my actual fear is a bit more obscure and i really honestly knew i'd fail if i was put in a room with it. 

when i entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* i was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross i can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

i did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. the rest of the contestants failed.

now, i won a pretty average car which i didn't particularly want, so as soon as i legally could i sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

i told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think i cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

i'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",3

i am 17, suffered a major accident while cycling when i was 13. i have 2 really deep,long facial scars. i have been bullied really bad because of it. i am tall, ugly and intimidating as per most girls. people make fun of other people by saying things like ""why don't you just hook up with u/throwawayfor2k19."" i am honestly used to it. those people didn't matter to me anyway.

but there is this girl i had known since middle school. let's call her back i guess? sorry, i honestly don't know how this works. i had a really, really big crush on her till a few days ago. i thought she was geniunely sweet and amazing. my family is incredibly supportive so they urged me to ask her out. i can play a guitar so i made this whole song for her. i went to the neighbouring city to get her favorite chocolate and stuff like that. this was the first time i felt like really going and asking someone out in my life, and i felt that regardless of what i do, she shall see me for who i am and at least accept me as a friend.

i was over the moon when she ended up accepting. we went to a fancy restaurant,had a fun time together and walked for 30 minutes. she was really sweet to me. the next week or so was honestly heaven. people started noticing me, even her friends seemed friendly with me, i honestly cried everyday because i felt so fortunate to get so much love.
it all broke down when a friend of hers, who was on instagram and followed beck, sent screenshots to me. i honestly felt betrayed and disgusted.

she had posts saying 'fulfilled his lifelong wish by being his valentine's"", 'making his day by finally helping him interact with my friends','he is ugly but beautiful people accept ugly people' '#uglypeoplematter' etc. beck's friend then explained me that she apparently wanted a good social media image and had thus asked all her friends to be kind to me and tolerate me till the first week of march, and then distance themselves from me. she apparently wanted to win some stupid 'positive role model' award for her college application because she was lagging behind in community service.and thought playing with my feelings for a few days wouldn't hurt, and apparently since i was ugly she was the kind one to give me attention anyway.

i was in tears and honestly felt disgusted. my blood was boiling. i researched about this award, found a facebook page about it online.i went to the authorities to confirm if her name was on the nominations list, and then had my friend's at work and family as alibi.

she is apparently crying a lot because she received a message from the committee saying her nomination was withdrawn. i am now even more ostracised in school, but honestly i have no remorse whatsoever and feel far more satisfied.


edit: i am honestly really grateful for not only judging me(not in that way) but also giving me love and support. each comment means the world to me. i am honestly crying reading some of the encouragement. no one besides my family has said these things to me. i know it might seem silly,but it geniunely means the world to me guys. from the bottom of my heart,thank you.

edit 2: honestly the support is geniunely overwhelming. i promise to not let you down and to continue being a good person. thank you for the gold.thank you all so much for the private messages you have sent me too. i honestly have gone through as many as i can and i just feel really fortunate and grateful.

i sincerely hope you all have an amazing life ahead. thank you so so much, this has been one of the highlights of my year.

edit 3: i am sorry for boring you with all these edits. i geniunely can't thank you guys enough. i showed my parent's these posts and they had tears of joy too. i am so thankful to each and every one of you guys, loads of love.

but, i have been noticing a worrying number of dms saying me i could have used her body and had some fun after knowing the truth etc.

i am not this kind of person and i hope nobody is. i have my own integrity. it's not right to just forcefully have sex with her, that's appalling. a couple of other dms sent me links to secret webcams to expose her nudes etc. it's honestly horrifying. i am not that kind of person and shall never ever be one. i just want to make the world a better place and the people around me happy. 

i thank these people for their support, but their way to go around it is very wrong. a lot of women are amazing. my mother is amazing, the person who sent the screenshots is amazing, my coworkers are amazing, and i am sure many women out there are amazing.  please don't tell me to take 'the red pill' or anything of that sort. because i am not going to do that, ever. please don't say all women are manipulative etc. 

this post isn't anti-women in anyway, it's me talking about the person i believe wronged me.",3
"by agreeing to an ""open relationship"". obviously a throwaway. 

to put things into perspective, i (m 20) and my gf (f 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. 

we decide to spice things up a bit and ""open"" up our relationship a little. it was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole ""sex is fun"" idea.

she is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she's met a guy (m 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn't working at the time. i agreed. i tell her to go for it, and she does. she texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.

the week after, she mentions she's meeting up with this guy again. wasn't expecting it but i'm cool with it. again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. a decision i would live to regret. she doesn't text me the entire night. weird, but okay maybe she's just having a good time?

the next day i receive a load of messages about how she needs a ""break"" from ""everything"" right now. meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. a little more conversation and we're over. she's completely cut me out of her life. i check her snap chat story, and of course, she's with him. i've heard from her friends that they're dating now. 

tldr; agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.",4
"girlfriend's little brother used my collection of '64 kennedy half dollars to buy drugs. my girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. he lives with us (we are both late 20's and have ft jobs).

i have been stacking 1964 kennedy half dollars for ten years now. for those that don't know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

i had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

i insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like i mentioned. whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that's what her brother thought he was stealing. and according to her ""he only got $100 of weed so that's fair"". okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? what then?

she also called my silver stack ""useless and paranoid and stupid"". i collect them partially for a store of value incase of inflation or deflation, but i also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

i guess i'm looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they're worth for the value of silver. it also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?",7
"for telling my son that if he changes his last name then i'm no longer his father?. let me start off by saying my son, adam, is 22 years old. back when my ex wife, tori, and i were trying for kids we found out that i was infertile. we decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. i was thrilled because i thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. no, i was wrong. my ex wife cheated on me and i didn't find out until 20 years later. 

tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. my ex and i divorced a few weeks later. ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological father. he did and they started to become really close. it hurt me much more than i thought it would. 

he's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. they started to bond really well, and all of a sudden adam became really distant from me. it's been like this for almost a year and a half. i try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with chris (biological father). i tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. we used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about chris.

i couldn't stand it. my son who i raised since he was a baby treated me like i didn't matter. any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. what i mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. i'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. he also changed his major from econ to computer science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

i told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. he never did. i told him numerous times and he never changed. he was still distant.

what was the final straw for me was the phone conversation i had with him last week. he said he was going to change his last name to chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i told him this ""i can't believe you are going to do this. that's really disappointing to me. if you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then i'm no longer your father and i don't want to be involved in your life."" 

he hung up on me. i didn't even bother reaching out because i know he wouldn't respond. i stand by what i said. i meant every word and still do. the last name change to me means he no longer views me as a father and views chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

my family told me i'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. i was told to post it here. so reddit am i being an asshole?

info: something to add. after i found out about chris i took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or adam. they didn't contact me. i didn't contact them. i needed a break.

edit 2: a lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and i think i finally figured out why he's been so cold. a few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. his grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that i am fully in charge of. enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. after a semester of university he started dating this girl. he was head over heels in love with her. 

i never met the girl so i have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. suddenly after a few months of dating adam asked me for about $3k to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. i already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. i asked adam why he needed the money. he said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

i told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. he spent over 1k on her in just under a few months. he would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. to me she was just after my son's inheritance and i was right. what i said to him was basically this ""adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. that's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. if you 2 were more serious then i would think about it, but i'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. they broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

he was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. then we found out about my ex's affair. i don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. that was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",3
"for telling my son he deserved his gf breaking up with him?. so my son had a long-distance gf recently for about two years. she was great, a really nice girl and we all loved her welcomed her with open arms. she was flying here constantly to visit him, like a weekend a month and he didn't lift a finger to go visit her. 

i tried talking to him about it several times and told him he should really start looking into flying over to her instead of expecting her to do all the travelling. he said no. and my wife probably had something to do with it as she constantly told him she was afraid of him flying. i spoke to them both and said this girl is great for him, she was willing to move over to our country too, but said there was one condition and that was he'd have to fly over to her country too. which is fair enough. 

he said no, he didn't want to fly or travel anywhere. my son was becoming lazier and lazier, eventually telling his gf and us that he was perfectly fine never travelling anywhere including holidays etc. 

last week, he told us she's dumped him. i went on her fb page as we're all still friends (she wrote us an apology letter about how she's upset it didn't work out but these things happen, so we're on good terms) and looks like she's with a new guy already. me and my wife have no doubt she was seeing him whilst still in a relationship with my son. 

i confessed to them both that i actually agree with her decision and he should have expected it. he did not treat her properly and i hope he learns lessons for the next one because he needs to make more of an effort. i said he deserves it for his lack of effort in the relationship and for essentially just allowing this girl to spend all her money and time coming here all the time. 

wife and son are very upset that i said this. very very upset and my wife says i am being horrible. 

aita? i stand by what i said.",3

"by going down a reddit rabbit hole.. this didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and i bought a new car. i was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

i came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse reddit while i'm taking care of my business. most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. i can't remember what sub i was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. before i knew it i was reading about ""the donkey show."" yes that one. some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. i wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so i just kept reading.

someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how the donkey show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. midget porn. i thought, ""what the hell, i've never seen this sort of thing before."" so i clicked.

as weird as it sounds, i clicked out of curiosity......i swear. what i saw was exactly what i expected to see. this specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. after a minute or so, i had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub i was in.

i finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. i get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

she was taking a while, so i grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. my wife comes out and gets in the car. immediately she says, ""what the hell is this?"" i put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. on the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". i had never had a car with this feature before, so i was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. i knew i was screwed. it felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so i could change what was displayed on the screen.

after about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks i have a thing for little people. before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. all i could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. i'm pretty sure i'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. yay me...

she said to me one day, ""i know you won't leave me for another woman, but i'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

i doubt she will ever let this one go...

tl;dr i went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.

edit: damn! i fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, you guys are awesome! i'm glad you got a kick out of my mishap.

edit2: just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while i was pleading my case, we kept it very g rated.

"bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because i dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?. i have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way i dress. my neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

about a month ago, i moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. i didn't expect any trouble. my first introduction to this woman, let's call her karen, was my first week here. i went to check the mail and i wasn't wearing a bra. i had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. karen is one of *those* southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. you know the type. she waved at me and i waved back, trying to be pleasant. she came at me, i thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

it was creepy and weird. i am not at all well endowed, i go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not karen. karen urged me to think of her children and jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. it was so goddamn weird, i felt like laughing in her face, but i didn't want there to be issues so i said i'd be more diligent in the future and karen went about her business.

well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for karen, y'all, oh no. not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. while my breasts are small and humble, i am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

the second time karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. she threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated i got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a jezebel and that i needed jesus. because i was wearing jean shorts.

we live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and i like to go out for walks, but it seems every time i step foot out of my door, there's fucking karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. it's getting annoying. 

this is in florida, by the way.

edit: i got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (i do not regularly dress like this) i must have been quite a sight to karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. she started laying into me. i just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then i said ""you can stop the games, karen. i see the way you look at me, i know you want me."" her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""i'll pray for you."" then scurried away. actually went inside her house. 😂",2

"young men opting out of society to play video games and focus on their hobbies are ... acting completely reasonable.. there are a lot of whiny articles recently about how men don't go to university at the same rate as young women, don't work as many hours as they used to, and in general participate less in society and rather play video games or something. this naturally comes at the expense of traditional life attainments such as working yourself to death, having an insanely expensive wedding, and being the sole provider for a family that will eventually kick you out.

&#x200b;

if you read through these articles, you will find that the theme is *men bad* because they refuse to play the social role written for them. it's mostly from the perspective of how this creates problems for women in the long run, but still that's the core of it.

contrary to what these journalists would have you believe, i think these young men are acting completely rationally when opting out of this life script. there just aren't enough incentives to play this role, it is too risky and too exhausting, and i can personally see how one would derive way more satisfaction from hanging out with ones mates, playing video games, or being in a band. young men don't owe society anything. we should just live and let live, and let people enjoy their lives in the way they want to, instead of judging them.

"for being honest with my nephew about where i was for most of his life?. okay, let me just get right into this. i 27m was kicked out at 16 because my older sister 37f outed me to my parents as gay. they completely cut off all contact with me and i didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. when i was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. for the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

a couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and i ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. he asked me why i wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. i asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. i told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until i eventually confessed i was cut off for being gay. he made a face and asked how my parents even found out. i told him i was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that i don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. he got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

i got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that i'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". i explained to her that i didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and i think he's old enough to deserve honesty. she just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. i'm crushed because obviously i love the kid. did i do the wrong thing? should i have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",3

well, i took y'alls advice and went back to the restaurant, i spent about an hour and a half waiting and then speaking with a shift manager who called the general manager who called the owner, and they swore up and down that no one had come to ask for a tape or anything of the sort. 

then i started looking for defense attorneys but i wasn't sure exactly how to proceed, honestly this week i've been mortified and really on edge. finally when i told my friends about everything one of them fessed up to the fact that it was actually them and they made it up as some kind of prank. pretty twisted joke, i wasn't laughing. i'm pretty pissed and seriously reconsidering my relationship with him. i appreciate everyone's support, excluding the people who made fun of my mother's death or tried to figure out where i lived.

"i told my math teacher about my mother, and she got arrested.. i got my 13 year old brother after school yesterday and we went to see my math teacher. i didn't tell him all the details, but i told him my mother wanted too put a device on me to keep me from having sex, and my brother and i showed him the healed burn things like you guys suggested. at first he wanted to call our mom but that actually made my brother cry in fear so he didn't because i told him i'd run away and call the police if he did.

he called a bunch of people, and about an hour later the police and a bunch of other people showed up. apparently they'd already been suspicious about our neighborhood. they talked to us away from eachother and i had to tell several people what happened, there was one lady who i told everything real specific. she was very nice and didn't make me feel ashamed at all.

we went back home with them and i showed the police where my mother kept drugs that i'm pretty sure we're illegal. she wasn't there but all my other 6 siblings who are home schooled were. then they went down the street to where my mom and our preacher were and i don't know what happened but they arrested her i think for drugs and other stuff and someone else whose house they were at because they were doing drugs i think (that's what they usually do) but not the preacher. i think they're gonna look into it though. 

there were a bunch of people and police who talked to all of us more and eventually they took us to a place where they said we'd stay for now. like a shelter or something. 

i should of done this year's ago, i feel really bad because i could have had my siblings taken better care of. i don't really know what's happening or gonna happen but the place i'm in now is way cleaner than i'm used to and we have clothes and stuff and food and we don't have to watch toddlers anymore. they weren't happy when they figured out stuff like the burns and that my 11 and 10 year old sisters can't read at all. they also weren't very happy with our house i could tell.

i hope we don't have to go back. and i hope it's ok to post this. even tho i don't need advice anymore. thank you to everyone who helped me.",2

what happened was that when he went out that day he saw his friend and they went to see another friend (of his, not my brother). that was a drug dealing location, things went bad when my brother was there and someone was heavily beaten up which my brother and his friend saw. that's when they decided to... his friend was kept silent under the threat for his life (he was dealing for them). recently he was arrested and confessed and reported my brother's murder to get a better deal.

the officer says my brother didn't die in pain. it was multiple gunshots. you'd expect after 6 years of playing this possibility in our heads we would have been prepared for it but we weren't. we had a funeral for him. now there's a place that i can go and talk to him and at least feel a little closer to him even though he's gone.

i thank all of you who helped.

"i pretended to be the merch guy at a concert so i could steal t-shirts.. pretty much just the title. 5 or 6 years ago my wife and i went to see a band we used to love. after 20 minutes or so of waiting for the merch guy to come man his booth, i had the bright (and very drunken) idea to pretend to man the booth myself. it really started as a funny gag just to make her laugh. almost immediately people came up to buy stuff. i turned them all away, which made them very confused. however, my wife did pretend to be a customer and i ""sold"" her two shirts, which really we just stole.

in my defense, i never took anyones money (i told them i was waiting to get the square reader from the bands frontman) and we did originally intend to pay for the shirts, their merch guy just never showed up. i remember it once or twice a year and am overwhelmed by guilt... for like a minute.",11

"serious my (35m) girlfriend (24f) wants me to act like a horse when we have sex, and i'm not into it at all.. so, tiny bit of backstory, my girlfriend of 6 months loves horses, has all her life. an additional, seemingly relevant point is, during sex, she sometimes says stuff like 'f*** me with that horse cock'. i've never thought much of it, i thought that was just a way of her saying it's big. but she's started to take it further and it's turned into a bit of a fetish that i'm not entirely comfortable with. a few days ago, she told me she wanted to roleplay, and at first i was pretty on board, but then she said as horses. i laughed, thinking it was a joke and she took it the wrong way, and said she was tired and then went to sleep. i said fuck it and, trying to make her feel better, said i'd do it the following day. honestly it was okay but very, very weird, she got so into it and said it was the best she ever had, and next time wanted to buy costumes, and maybe do it on some hay. i told her no, and i didn't want to do it again and she's back to being mad at me. am i being a dick here? i don't know what to do. sorry if wrong sub, just wanted a second opinion",7

"my 25m girlfriend29 suggested about having a ffm threesome. i was skeptical at first and politely turned it down but gave in when she kept on talking about how awesome it would be. now she is giving me a hard time because i accepted the idea and didn't deny strongly. am i being manipulated?. hello all,
a few days ago my25m girlfriend29 suggested that we should have a threesome with another girl.

knowing her, i disagreed at first. she kept on insisting and i gave into the idea. i cherished the idea and we started talking about how we are going to get this done.
a few hours later she blocked me on messaging and was not responding to my calls. then when i finally reached her she was crying. she seemed broken. she told me that i didn't deny her strong enough. she told me that had i ever insisted on having a threesome with another guy, she would have denied it. she was mad and we broke up because i didn't deny her strongly.
basically, i feel as if she set up a trap and is now giving me a hard time for it..
i feel that i am being manipulated. dear reddit, please help me out. thanks.

update (2 weeks after the post): first off, thanks a lot for this overwhelming response. the comments and messages helped through this turbulent time. thanks a lot.

we had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. so, i decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. no clue about her intentions though, but i am at a much better place. thank you reddit!",7
"can marvel shut the fuck up for like a decade at least?. they're over-saturating the market to the extent that they're really going to go the way of the western at some point. talk about franchise fatigue. yeah, *marvel isn't immune*. they're going to crash, and crash hard at one point. 

and, no, the positive reviews they keep getting really aren't honest, and thats been getting more transparent in all the latest marvel releases. 

from a craftsmanship perspective, they simply aren't good films and have been barely nominated for technical awards. the stories are simplistic and very heavy on fan service and basic roller coaster action movie techniques. 

they're almost identical to the transformers movies, just with slightly better creative vision. 

no, i'm not the arbiter on what films are trash and what films are good, or anything, but the critics load up rt with fresh scores for every marvel film with dozens of complaints about the films and just end up designating it ""4 stars"" or ""fresh"" because ""it's fun, i guess"" or ""it'll work for the audience it's meant for"". these films are graded on a massive curve and the only reason people like them is because it's in the zeitgeist to. 

of all the franchises and stories that have become extremely successful across the decades, marvel is the one that earned that success the least. it just pushes out constant, uninspired, artistically vacant films on a conveyor belt and calls them ""new"" and ""creative"" because they change up the setting a bit. no. no, i'm sorry, that's not the picture of creative dexterity. they're safe, bland, blow em up action films.",6
"for telling the girl who kissed my boyfriend for a play that she is desperate and pathetic?. i (19f) study drama at uni, and my boyfriend is on the same course. my boyfriend is a really good-looking guy, but he doesn't seem to know it. he gets a lot of attention from girls and for the most part, doesn't seem to get that they're flirting with him. i'm not generally annoyed by this, and never really say anything.

however, there's one girl in our class, let's call her victoria, who is obsessed with my boyfriend. she goes out of her way to be paired with him in group activities (for example, if the professor picks groups by numbering us 1, 2, 3, she will move herself to be in the same number as him) and she recently stepped down from a main role in a play we're doing so she could be in a more minor one, simply because this character has a romance with my boyfriend. i know this is the case, because i've heard her say to her friends that she thinks he's hot and what not.

i've never said anything to her about it, because she seems pretty insecure (always complaining about how she thinks she's ugly) and i don't see it as a big deal because my boyfriend doesn't care. however, we recently performed the play and had a small afterparty where she got slightly drunk and was bragging about how she 'definitely felt something' when they kissed in the play and she's 'going to ask him if he felt the same'. i rolled my eyes and again ignored it, until she actually went up to my boyfriend. she was a little bit drunk, and when she went up to him i was there too.

victoria started saying that she knows he must have felt a spark, he's a really good kisser, etc. i snapped, and sort of shouted at her that 'you sound incredibly desperate, going after somebody else's boyfriend. you're pathetic if you think a stage kiss means you should be together.'

she looked super embarrassed and walked away, and i later heard she'd gone home crying. i feel like a dick because she's obviously insecure and whatnot, and her friends haven't stopped calling me a bitch since. aita?

"for not telling my wife that i picked her daughter up drunk from a house party?. i'm going to try to keep this short and simple. i always tell my daughter and my stepdaughter if they're ever in a situation that they need to get out of, just call me and i'll drop whatever i'm doing and i will pick them up no questions asked no judgments made. i let them know that i used to be a teenager once before, i told them everyone is entitled to make bad decisions every now and then. we're only human and it's a part of life.

last weekend i got a call from my stepdaughter (17), she told me she snuck out of the house and went to a party and had too much to drink. she was scared of passing out at the party because there was people there she didn't know.

i got there just in time, she was so drunk she couldn't even walk. i had to pick her up and carry her to the car. i told her i was disappointed that she snuck out, but i also told her i was glad she made the right choice, the safe choice to have me pick her up.

i haven't told my wife about it, because i don't want to violate the deal i made with her. i want her to know that she can trust me. i just hope i'm making the right choice.",3
"stop spending money on food! -- buy a crockpot. **holy shit at the money people spend on food!**

and i was the exact same way when i landed my first job out of college.  you know what i'm talking about--biscuit and starbucks on the way to work, lunch out with coworkers and pizza and beer at the local tavern for dinner!  every night!  all week!  professional money spender!  and more beers and dinners on the weekends!  woohoo!

wait.  where did all my money go?  and how the hell did i gain 40 pounds in six months?  if you're nodding your head you've fallen into the brand-new-job-big-salary-eat-out-because-i-can trap.  and you have to stop it.  it's killing your bank account, it's killing your financial freedom and it's killing *you*. (literally--i was on the edge of type 2 diabetes and had hyperglycemia during routine physicals.)

**what you know you need to do: *stop eating out***

but how??? how do i stop eating out???  fast food is *soooo* good!  and cooking is *soooo* hard!  well, first off, not really--you're just attuned to that garbage 'food'.  you're going to break free of both these stereotypes and someone has already invented it.....

>crockpot.  it's the crockpot.  crockpot.  crockpot.  maybe you call it a slow cooker, but i'm from georgia and here it's a crockpot.  

***!stop!***--if you do not own a crockpot i highly recommend you go buy one from amazon and buy the biggest one you can afford!

get one with a timer that switches to warm after the cook settings: *just google it cause mods dont like links!*

**boom!**  $39 investment.  we're going to make that back in.... *three days*.  are you ready?  we're going to make enough food for dinner *and* left overs for lunch.

i'm going to give you some of my super-secret-i-eat-this-every-week-crockpot-meals that are delicious, cheap, filling and easy.  yes.  the crockpot makes *all* of those possible.

**meal 1: thick cut porkchop with potatoes and carrots**

>servings: 4

>ingredients:

>1 can beef broth (50 cents)

>1 packet brown gravy mix (50 cents)

>1 packet onion soup mix (50 cents)

>1 package of 4 thick cut porkchops ($7)

>6 carrots (50 cents)

>4 large gold yukon potatoes ($2)

>sack o' salad ($2)

>total cost for lunch and dinner: $13/4 about $3 each.

>spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.  add beef broth, gravy mix and onion soup mix and stir.  place porkchops in broth.  chop carrots and potatoes and add to top of porkchops.  that's it.

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home make your salad and dig in.  use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**meal 2: sausage, potato and kale soup**
>servings: 4

>1 pound italian sausage ($4)

>1 white onion ($1)

>1 32 oz box of chicken stock ($1.50)

>1 bag of prewashed kale ($3)

>3/4 cup heavy cream ($1)

>5 large gold yukon potatoes ($2)

>1 head of garlic ($1)

>total cost: about $14/4 = 3.50 a serving

>brown italian sausage with chopped garlic and chopped onion.  while meat is browning add to crockpot the 3/4 cup of heavy cream, chicken stock, and chopped yukon potatoes.  add browned sausage and top with half the bag of kale.  (i get two recipes per bag of kale).

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home dig in! use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**meal 3: super awesome easy chili**
>servings: a lot (6-8?) -- i eat this *all* the time and it's delicious.  stores really well in the refrigerator (and chili gets better over time!)

>3 cans of black beans ($2)

>2 cans of hot chili beans ($1)

>2 cans of red kidney beans ($1)

>8 cans of diced tomatoes ($6)

>1 pound of ground beef ($4)

>1/2 cup of chili powder ($1)

>1/4 cup of garlic powder ($1)

>1/4 cup of onion powder ($1)

>3 tablespoons of cumin ($1)

>3 tablespoons black pepper ($1)

>edit: the spice proportions are correct!  this makes nearly two gallons of good (about 7l).

>edit: salt to taste($1)

>total cost = $20/8 = about $2.50 per serving

>drain the tomatoes and kidney beans but don't drain the black or chili beans.  brown the ground beef.  add everything to the crockpot and stir like crazy.... and that's it!

>prepare this before you go to bed for the next day!  put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  cook on low for 8 hours.  when you get home dig in! use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.


it's easy guys.  it's really easy.  you spend 15 minutes a night and you make *tons* of food for lunch and dinner and you save a lot of money!  and its good for you! (better than wendy's--that's for sure!)  and its easy!

**stop spending your money on eating out and go full crockpot!  i am much happier and much wealthier!**

edit: for our vegetarian friends.  you can't get any more simple than this!

**meal 4: baked potato**
>servings: as many potatoes as you bake

>1 potato

>cover in tin foil and place directly in crockpot.  cook on low 4-6 hours or keep on warm all day.


**meal 5: vegetable soup**
>servings: however much you want to make

>tomatoes, potatoes, green beans, zucchini, carrots, peas, or onions

>vegetable stock

>onion powder, garlic powder, salt and black pepper

>add vegetables in any proportion you desire to crockpot and add vegetable stock until covered.  season to taste.  cook on low until vegetables are tender.

edit 2: i live in georgia and shop at kroger--prices may vary.  if you live in canadia or buy organic free range vegetables harvested by hipsters with a minimum of a master's degree you will obviously pay more.

edit 3: ""just learn to cook!""--yeah, okay guys.  i agree.  i cook more than just in a crockpot.  this post was inspired after i read a /r/personalfinance about a single guy who spends $1300 a month on food because ""he didn't have enough time to cook with work"".  i wrote a very long comment and just made it into a post.  the point was you can eat decent food in a short amount of time and save money by planning one day ahead.  

edit 4: i agree fresh vegetables are better and these aren't the *healthiest* recipes.  this post was just to encourage those that eat all the time to transition to something healthier... and then they can transition to something even healthier... and on and on until they've become a raw vegan, growing their own vegetables, saving the whales and composting regularly.

edit 5: electricity costs: crockpots seem to consume between 200w and 700w per hour.  that's between 2 and 6 kwhs for 8 hours of cooking.  that's about 15 to 60 cents.  it seems insignificant relative to the overall cost of food.

edit 6: i'm not a shill or marketing person for crockpot.  i'm a mechanical engineer.  don't believe me?  my first post on reddit ever was about bolt failures:  https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3e20vs/bolt_failure_modes/ctatj1y/

take off your tin foil hat..... and use it to wrap a baked potato to put in your *new crockpot!!!*",10

"i gave a lactose intolerant customer dairy on purpose. i know this sounds weird but when i worked at starbucks, there was a regular customer that was very difficult and rude. i was warned of this customer on my first day of training. she came in every morning and would try to rush the workers on doing their job and makes other customers feel uncomfortable. 3 months into working, she came in one morning and caused absolute hell. she was complaining about her drink while one of my coworkers was making the drink. as soon as she got it she accidentally ""spills"" it and asks for a completely different drink. i was so fed up. she wanted a frappuccino. she went to the bathroom while we were making the new order. i switched with my coworker and made the drink. instead of almond milk i made the frappuccino with regular milk. the drink was ready by the time she left the bathroom. she takes the drink and takes a sip and didn't complain. 5 hours later she calls the starbucks from the hospital and i was the one who picked up. she got in a car accident trying to rush to a bathroom. she said she shitted her pants. i couldn't be anymore happier that she was safe but got her karma.",11

"if i called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?. my son was born when i was only 15 years old, and i've been a single dad since i was 18. it was hard living for a long time money-wise but i always tried to do best by my son. today i own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. he came out to me when he was 14 years old and i've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

i've been with my fiance now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son – at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. my son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and i've gotten to know him really well. however my fiance told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. that if they found out, they would have a complete fit. this really bothered me because i refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. what is going to happen in the future? when my son gets married himself? will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? he's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. when i told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that i was being selfish and over-dramatic – that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. i told her that this was unacceptable and that i was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. it's my wedding too and i was his boyfriend there. 

after that i got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. however, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. i do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. i love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. i told my brother and he said that i was being the asshole here – that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. i still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. would i be the asshole if i did this? am i being unreasonable here?",3

"updatefired for being fat. update to: https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/bx4q0p/fired_for_being_fat_ct/   

i posted this 2 weeks ago and a lot has happened. something happened before i could go any further with the lawyer i spoke to.

the monday following the incident i was asked to come speak with a vp of hr i'd never met and only knew by name, because they work directly for the company that bought ours out. when i walked in the conference room there were 4 people waiting for me, 2 of which i was told was part of legal. what i didn't realize, is my friend who i mentioned in the comments of the other post ended up saying something to another coworker because he was so horrified at the situation (even though i told him to keep it secret). this information ended up making it's way up the chain and was not taken well, to say the least. i was asked to explain exactly what happened, who i told, and asked a lot of questions. everything i said seemed to make them very uncomfortable, especially when i told them i was in touch with a lawyer. they had me leave the room for nearly 40 minutes and then called me back in and let me know they were very concerned about this situation, and assured me it was an isolated power trip basically....  

this is the holy shit part. they say that due to my long tenure in my position, knowledge of how the team works, and my relationship with clients that they felt i would be a good fit for the position the jerk manager sat in, and if i wanted the position it was mine, as their way of saying sorry. they also made sure to mention the large salary increase and bonuses this would come with. i took a couple minutes to think about it, and took the offer. btw i'm not stupid, i know they did this so i wouldn't take any legal action against them, but i love my job and don't blame them for the actions of a 20something on a power trip. i also know it came down to he said/she said, and would've been a hard case to prove.

there's going to be a company-wide training on gender and interpersonal relations, and i finally have an office with a door i can actually close! i'm in the field a lot less now, so i guess the jerk got what he wanted, because now i don't interact face to face nearly as much as i used

"happy update: wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c225le/update_wifef33_and_i_m34_decided_to_try_for_kids/

i'm sorry to drag ya'll through the worst of my insecurities.  i definitely channeled quite a bit of my negative shit into what i posted.  but hey, that's what anonymous people are good for sometimes i guess.

anyways, we finally sat down after she got home last night.  i told her everything that was going on.  the urologist, the money, the upcoming appointment.  i told her how, even with all her reassurances, too many suspect things kept happening.  

she agreed how everything looked, and immediately apologized.  she didn't realize how much my last exs cheating was still affecting me.  she knew i was off going into the weekend, but thought we addressed that. we talked about it sunday, but i can get pretty internal with all these worries and not show them outwardly.  and so while she had thought we were communicating, i wasn't.  we decided to start from the beginning and go through everything together.

the money was the real problem for me. she agreed how inconsiderate it was with where my head was at to do that without mentioning it.  apparently the prenatal visits are so structured that they want you to set up a payment plan with them right away, and she wanted to make sure it was squared away to keep the appointment.  she offered without me prompting to call them with me tomorrow to verify that, or if i really wanted we could move the money back.  she does get better rewards out of hers so it kind of made sense.

we read up on obstructive azoospermia, and it doesn't seem like they're often invincible forcefields.  it seems like only the actual absence of the vas deferens (cbavd) actually guarantees complete infertility, so it is possible for some to get through. we're going to go back to the original specialist i was working with last year and hopefully get a clearer picture.  it turns out the appointment she made was the only time they had available so soon, and figured it'd be best not to wait.  i told her i took off work to go with, and she was relieved i could join.

once again, she said all the right things and seems genuine about getting us on the same page.  after going through each thing i was just wishing i believed her a little more before. she's stressed out with work and when she'll have to take off, but she really seemed to want to go out of her way to alleviate my concerns. she even offered an open phone policy if i needed.  we did look at the text i had seen, and it was just a girlfriend.  i declined though right now, since i don't want to be that husband.

this has really made me take a deeper look at what's in my past and how that still affects me today. even thinking back to this weekend, it was so hard to see in the moment how much all the uncertainty was affecting me.  that level of anxiety literally makes you question what around you is real.  i think the trust but verify is the best way to put it. i was just trying to verify without any of the trust is all.  this has all put a strain on our marriage right now, but i'm feeling a bit more like we're a team again working towards easing that.

she thought that an nipp asap was a great idea, as long as we also get some kind of counseling together.  i'm not big on therapy, but i can probably agree that it will most likely help.

i'm feeling a little better about everything.  thanks again to everyone who reached out and shared their own story (every other comment here i read was a story of a family member who was supposed to be barren and ended up popping out triplets), and most of all those who helped me try to communicate fairly through all of this.   it's time for me to hopefully be a father.

**tl;dr  use your words. - wife and i objectively went through everything.  we both apologized, getting a nipp soon and hopefully a therapist.**

"a story of how i just got out of paying a $1500 bill, why you should never blindly trust a debt collection agency, and always request proof of a debt owed. 😂😂😂. i got a call out of the blue a little over a month ago from a debt collection agency, saying i owed almost $1500 from an ambulance ride i took because of me being involved in a car accident over 2 years ago.

while on the phone with the debt collector, i looked up debt collection laws, and after a couple minutes of research decided to request a debt validation letter, which they are legally required to send me within 5 days of initial contact. 

long story short, never received it. instead they sent me a ""verification of balance"" letter. which immediately told me ""holy shit, they don't have proof i owe the debt. which means i'm not legally required to pay this shit.""

today, right before the 30 day cutoff, i receive another call from them attempting to collect the debt. i request to speak with a supervisor. after going back and forth with him for a few minutes about why they haven't sent me a debt validation letter (which they're required to do under the law), he transfers me to his supervisor. 

this is where it gets fun. i'm now going back and forth with him. after a few minutes he puts me on hold. roughly 3 minutes later he comes back on and says ""sir, after reviewing your file, it doesn't appear we have the documentation required, pertaining to the original bill, in order to send you a debt validation letter. however i am showing you have a balance owed here in your file of $1,410.54. would you like to pay a portion of it now, set up a payment plan, or...?""

holy fuck. 

this dumbass just admitted to me they don't have proof of me owing the debt. which means im not legally required to pay it. it's null and void. 

i tell him this, he gets flustered, and after some more back and forth, basically tells me to have a nice day and hangs up the phone.

i'm going to still send a letter requesting a copy of the debt validation letter via certified mail with a return receipt requested, to cover my ass. and when they don't, because they aren't able to, it's a done deal. 

if they try to put it on my credit report, i just contact the credit agencies with proof of me asking for the debt validation letter and never receiving it, and it gets removed from my credit report. 

moral of the story, always ask for documentation. don't let debt collectors scaring you into paying a debt you may not be required to pay.

here's the bogus ass letter i received. http://imgur.com/yg9udzh

edit: this seems to be a pretty common question, so i'm editing it into the main body of my post. i'm being asked if i actually even rode in an ambulance and if i did i should just pay it.

i was involved in an auto accident because some girl ran a red light and tboned me going 50m.p.h., and i had to take 2 ambulance rides because of it. 

i contacted my attorney and he sent me an itemized list of all debtors paid after the settlement which was finished 2 years ago. 

there was a couple ambulance companies listed on there, but the amounts did not match the $1410 this debt collector was claiming. and without an account number, or any sort of identifying info, i was unable to match it to either of the paid ambulance bills in the documentation i received from my attorney. 

thus me attempting to clarify this with the debt collector, via a debt validation letter.",10

"update: i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. &#x200b;

link to original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

i've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. i've also read through a lot of the comments. thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. there's been a lot of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. it's whatever at this point.

we had been texting off and on all evening. as promised, i agreed not to bring it up in person. when i got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. i was a little nervous not knowing what i might be walking into, but overall i just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. when i walked in it was clear so did she. her sister was helping her pack up her things. i didn't know what to say, but i never expected this. i honestly thought everything was going to be okay when i got home. her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

i walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. she didn't say anything either. she didn't even look at me. if she was going to leave i at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. everything i had read in the comments about buying a bidet and ocd lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than i had considered. i started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""you put this online? i told you to not talk about it!"" her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. she then accused me of cheating. what? this whole thing has been crazy and i feel like i had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. i snapped.

i told her sister i had never cheated. not once. i would never cheat on her. enough was enough, so i told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier i had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. everything went silent. like, no one said a word. out of nowhere they both start crying. her sister stared yelling at me and told me i shouldn't be talking about things i don't understand. when i asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that i need to mind my own business.

1. her sister knows about it. (she did not know i posted on reddit about it)
2. her sister thinks it's normal.
3. i need to mind my own business? they're my socks!

i stood there all kinds of messed up so i just left. i went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. i also called off work today. i went home and all her stuff is gone. i didn't text her back. i think i'm done.

to clarify a few things: she insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. she told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. she reaffirmed it's not a fetish. she won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. i can't keep up with the comments. i'm pooped. (i'm trying to find humor in this because i'm really upset :(

so yeah.

edit: (a sentence) her sister did not previously know i posted about it on reddit. i'm sure they both do now. ",7

"i think i got reverse catfished last night. i matched with this girl on tinder. she was significantly bigger than girls i normally date. but we have literally everything thing in common so i figured i'd give it a shot. so after talking for a few days we decided to meet up at this nerd bar last night.

i get there and pick a table. after waiting a few minutes this beautiful woman comes over and starts trying to flirt with me. that's very strange so i assume she must be after something. free drinks, drugs, my kidneys, i don't know.

so i explain to her that i'm actually waiting for someone and i don't want to give a bad first impression by chatting up some other woman when she walks in.

that's when she springs it on me that she's actually the one i'm waiting for. she told me how she's lost about 130lbs over the past couple years and she wants to make sure guys are actually interested in her and not just her body.

and she was also testing me to see if i would ditch the fat girl if someone hotter showed up. so here's the thing, i don't know how i feel about being ""tested"". i don't want to live my life questioning every decision i make like she might jump out from around the corner at any minute.

but she's also really attractive and very cool otherwise. i'm not sure how i should proceed.

"by letting my boyfriend have control over the lube.. we are in the middle of the polar vortex. i got a phone call last night saying that i didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.

we decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. i was ready to get laid, because, well, i wanted to. so i told my boyfriend to grab the lube while i climbed on top of him.

the bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it like this(https://i.imgur.com/llijq5v.jpg). i was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. he squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

while he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. he couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as i screamed and jumped off him.  the bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

i now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. we sobered up real quick, i fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

"i'm all for being kinky but certain 'kinks' are just a mental illness masquerading as being sexually adventurous. like if you like to be called ""daddy"" in bed it's a bit freudian, weird maybe, but i don't mind, you know? if you wanna be tied up, be tied up. have hot wax poured on your titties or snort coke of a dude's dong, i don't mind at all. 

but if you actually dress up as a baby and shit your diaper and get your rocks off to this, or pretend to be an animal and get off on fucking animals or babies, even if they are just 'pretend animals' and 'pretend babies', then it goes beyond a normal fetish and into the realm of mental illness.

"the way i (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. how do i tell people when they ask. so i met my boyfriend a year ago. i posted on my cities subreddit that i was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

i got about 50 messages all together. one guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. i love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. i gave him my number and we texted all night. our first phone call was over an hour.

he told me he was also lonely. i mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. he offered to cuddle me. we decided to have a cuddle date

we met up the following week. he picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. we got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

"i (36m) think my wife of 8 years (31f) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42m). throw away for obvious reasons.

so my wife and i have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  at first it's good and we start communicating better.  

about three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". alone.

around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

she starts telling her friends about ""danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which i think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""dr. soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""danny"".  (i don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and i were intimate.

there have been a couple of other weird coincidences that i thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  she went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  it was about 9;30 at night and that seemed really odd to me.

about a half hour later i tracked her iphone and the location showed up as his office.

when she came home 3 hours later, i asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

"update 2: i 31m found out my fiance cheated during her 30f bachelorette party, planning on leaving. i am making this as i feel i owe it to all of you. the amount of pm's and responses have been incredible. many of the decisions i have taken has come from people who supported me on reddit. both the negative and positive comments have helped me and i would like to thank all of you for taking the time to write me and support me.

yesterday i was having my phone spammed by many family members from her side, and friends. the only person i responsed to was the sister with part of the conversation where she and the sister talks about it all. i didnt include anything in the response except an image the conversation, and the sister went pretty much silent after that (until later).

during the day i contact the co-owner of my business and let him know the full story, he told me to take as much time as i need and even adviced me to head off to a vacation (this guy is a childhood friend of mine, i dont trust anyone as much as him). my plans have changed a bit, i am still staying at this hotel for another few days and then perhaps moving on to the friend i was supposed to go to. i called him up and let him know i want to head off somewhere, perhaps a trip to somewhere nice, another country or something, its all still not yet 100% decided, but i know i will be leaving for somewhere. he said he would be up for joining me if it could be during the upcoming weeks since he is still on holiday from his work. we will see how that turns out...

later in the day i responded to my wife, the calls kept coming in less frequently since i sent that message to her sister... i had this gut feeling she was going to come with an excuse of some sort.
i picked up the phone and first thing i hear is a ""torn up voice"" if u can say that in english. i could hear she had been crying all day and was in a messed up state. she kept begging me to come back, that there is an explanation to everything and that she loves me. she i have misunderstood the entire situation... i could hear the sister and someone else in the background (dont know who the other person was, maybe her friend?). anyway i told her to explain it to me right then and there. she said because i only seen a small part of the conversation its all been misunderstood, that i should come back home, that she loves me and that i have taken a rational decision to leave without a real reason. during the entire conversation i was just giving really short, empty answers in a cold way like ""yea, ok, what, explain it to me""...
after she told me its all a misunderstanding i told her to call me back in 10 minutes, and to check messenger.
after i hungup, i sent her the entire conversation log, with a ton of screenshots (not all of them, but most of the important ones). it didnt take 2 minutes for her to call back, crying hysterically saying sorry for everything, saying she wants to die rather than to lose me. she said she was ""forced"" by her friends and sister to have fun one last time, that she needed to let all the energy out before stepping into a marriage for life. i was just quiet during most of it. the more i didnt talk and just said ""ok"" the more she was crying.

she started telling me i can fuck other women if i want to get back at her, or that she will tell everyone about what she did so i can take her back, that she will do anything it takes for me to come back and that this was a mistake of her life and that she hates her sister and friends for this...
i told her fucking other woman was not something i needed, because the moment i met her and started loving her, she was the only woman i needed, i didnt need to meet or sleep with someone to know the best thing of my life was waiting at home. 
the sister was telling her stuff in the background but i couldnt hear, i dont know what the sister was telling her or if she was getting angry at her or something.

she kept begging me and begging me, and i just told her, if she comes clean to her parents and family i will think about it. after that she started saying something but i just hung up. 

for like half an hour my phone goes silent without much response, and her father calls me up and apologizes for everything, he and his wife know what happened now, and he is so sorry for all of this. he told me he understands how i feel and that he didnt raise his daughter to do this, he said he understand if i dont want to see her again but that i always will be welcome to him and that i am a good guy. his wife basically then takes/steals the phone from him and tells me she did a mistake and she regrets it and it will never happen again and that we can move forward from this. she tells me her daughter has never been this destroyed before. i politely tell her i appreciate her opinion and then say i have to go and goodbye.

my ex-fiance calls me back and beggs me again saying she told her parents and also sent a text message to her friends (our mutual friends) about what had happened. she then keeps crying asking me when i will come back to speak with her, and say we can even go to counselling and that she will pay for everything.
she kept apologizing and apoliogizing on the phone and i didnt say much.

after some time i just told her not to cry, that she shouldnt be apologizing because single women (like herself) are allowed to do these things and i hope she finds mr right. she starts crying even harder and her sister takes the phone and say sorry and tells me everything can be fixed and that i said i would take her back now that she told everyone what she did. i told the sister i only said i think about it, and now that i have i realised i dodged a bullet and wish her and her sister the best. she then tells me her sister is turning suicidal from all of this and that this is going to lead into a depression that can take her life. 
the only thing i said after she told me that was ""its a good thing you are close to her so you can make sure she doesnt kill herself then, maybe take her to a doctor or soemthing"". after this i just hung up.

my phone has been blowing up with messages from mutual friends, her and her sister saying sorry and basically begging me to come back. i dont plan on responding. i honestly feel alot better right now, like i can move on. i will be going for vacation this upcoming week i think. if someting more happens i will update this post.

maybe i will update in a month or couple of weeks, i dont know.

also i dont know what more to update at this point, alot of things have happened so if you have any questions feel free to ask and i will reply as they popup in the comments (i didnt know what other things you were wondering about me or the situation). aslong as it doesnt give away my full identity i dont mind answering them.

"often, being liked doesn't require you to be interesting/funny. it just requires you to make other people feel interesting/funny.. i'm not saying people never gain pleasure from others being interesting or funny. but the fact is in most interactions, everybody is heavily self-monitoring and will base their judgement of the success of the interaction on how people responded to *them*. if people laughed at their joke. if people found their anecdote interesting or shocking. if people agreed with their opinion. 

so the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they're boring is: you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself. honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you're talking to. listen. ask questions/follow-up questions. laugh at their jokes. and they'll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to. 

edit: for those saying isn't this just ego-stroking or being fake, it's not about sucking up to the other person at all. it's just empowering you to worry less about what you're saying, because the other person is almost certainly experiencing you in terms of how you respond to what they say anyway.

the rock was heavy so i brought it with us rather than lugging it home. my neighbors had one of those huge vans that sat like 15 people and had shelves above the seats so i put the rock in one of the selves (and struggled to do so, as it was so heavy). long story short, my baby brother sat below that shelf. at some point when the van stopped, the rock fell out of the shelf and crushed his little head. it wasn't super gory but it was bad enough to have killed him right away. right in front of my mom, me, my brother, sister, and our friends and their mom. at an intersection during a red light. 

i just remember my mom screaming ""where did that come from"" and ""oh god, my baby"" over and over again. it came out as a whisper at first but eventually i was about to choke out an audible ""me"" and i'll never forget the look on my moms face. it was a mixture of pure grief, knowing my brother was dead. anger, because i had done something so dumb that it resulted in the death of her youngest child. and compassion, because i know she wanted to hug me and tell me it wasn't my fault. but she couldn't at that time. she's regretted it for years and has apologized to me over and over but all she said at that moment was ""you killed your brother"". 

i'm 26 now and it's been 16 years since my brother died and i'm still in therapy. my family has assured me every day since that it wasn't my fault and nobody blames me and that's a sweet sentiment but it was still my fault. it was an accident but i still directly caused it. that sweet little baby is dead because of me and i can't escape it. watching my parents grieve like that was unbearable, and they still feel so much pain. 

i just can't stand the pain anymore. my whole life has been a wreck since then and i can't seem to get myself on track. i'm a high school drop out who has to leave work at least once a month because of my severe and constant panic attacks. i have full days where i'm paralyzed and can't get myself out of bed. i feel like i should be dead, and not my brother. 

if you read all of this, thank you. it was hard to write. i just need the universe to know that i haven't forgot what i've done, and i want everyone to know that i'm so sorry. i'll never forgive myself and i'll never forget.



edit: wow. i posted this right before work and wasn't expecting this reaction. thank you to everyone who has replied and dm'd me. if i can't respond, please know when i get off work i'm going to read everything and it means so much to me. thank you so much to everyone.

edit #2: there are so many comments and messages so it's hard and very emotional to try and respond to each of you, even though i wish that i could. you all have brought me so much peace today. it's hard to even explain. i'm sitting here sobbing reading all of your replies but it's giving me so much peace. thank you, from the bottom of my heart. i will always keep this account logged in so i can keep your messages close to me and read them when things are hard. i can't tell you how much all of your kind words have meant to me.",11

"neighbors assaulted me and took my daughter (later returned her) because of suspected attempt to drink and drive. male, late 20's, co

i quit drinking soda and energy drinks a few months ago (i haven't consumed alcohol in years) and i replaced that habit with drinking martinelli's sparkling apple juice. the juice comes in 10oz. glass bottles that look very similar to corona beer bottles. 
here lies my issue:
this morning i was walking to my car from my apartment and i had a bottle of my juice in one hand and my 1 year old daughter, in her car seat, in the other hand. my neighbors basically jumped me from behind. one grabbed my daughter's car seat and the other was punching, kicking, and yelling at me. he was saying stuff like ""the nerve of you to drink and try to drive with your baby."" as a result, my juice bottle shattered in the parking lot cutting my hand, my cell phone's screen is destroyed, and i think my nose is fractured. most importantly, the neighbor who took my baby went inside his apartment with her and it took 10 minutes of me explaining through the screen door that i was not about drink and drive, but that i was drinking apple juice. this all just happened. i'm calling the cops. any suggestions?

btw, i didn't get any apologies or anything from the neighbors. they said they were doing their ""duty"" to protect the community.

update:

the police showed up. as soon as they pulled up more than a half dozen neighbors came out and are giving witness reports. 

update #2:

both men were arrested and i will be making my way down to the police station in a few minutes. i will be talking to detectives. the police assured me (off the record) that both will be serving time because felonies were committed. ",2
"amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist and thus deserves to be in jail see below. edit: thanks for the awards. i hope this post can raise some awareness.

in a speech schumer gave(https://thoughtcatalog.com/anonymous/2014/05/wait-a-second-did-amy-schumer-rape-a-guy/) at the  ms. foundation for women's gloria awards and gala, she confessed to having sex with a college friend that was so drunk, he couldn't even get an erection let alone consent to having sex. ""and then came the sex, and i use that word very loosely. his penis was so soft, it felt like one of those de-stress things that slips from your hand"". sex without consent is the very definition of -rape-.

amy also confessed to sexually assaulting her male cab driver in a podcast and casually laughed about it; nobody cared. in this link(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8urhxqrq2_4&feature=youtu.be&t=480), amy admits to forcefully grabbing her driver's hand, putting it on her vagina and getting the driver to finger her. the host says ""so you raped a guy"" at 11:12(https://youtu.be/8urhxqrq2_4?t=670) and amy replies ""yeah i know. when i tell this story i say i let a cab driver finger me but really i took his hand...\sic\"". if the genders were reversed and a male comedian had confessed to stuff like this twice, he'd be in jail after public outrage. why the double standards. amy schumer is a self-confessed rapist.",6
"by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.. i'm in my third year of university taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. to start the semester i ended up missing the first week of school because i was on a last minute trip with my friends. it was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since i technically couldn't afford to go.

anyway, i came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. on both those days i have classes all day until 2pm so i usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. so my first tuesday home i ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. so as part of my degree i have to take microeconomics which all i knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. when i get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so i just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

this goes on for 3.5 weeks. i came to class. took notes. then did the weekly assignments. on the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is febuary 1st. so the class before the exam, january 30th, i decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. now i was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was all theory based while the class was heavy math based. i understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. i explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*explains above about material*
prof: ""what do you mean theory? all the assignments are filled with math. are you using launchpad?""
me: ""no the assignments are online. like the website we bought the textbook from. whats lauchpad?""
prof: ""pardon? i don't have a textbook for this course.""
me: ""it literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*shows syllabus*
prof: ""wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
me: ""what do you mean...? this is econ 202 right?""
*prof starts laughing*
prof: ""haha this is econ 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. this is a new one, i've never experienced this before.""
me: ""well this is awkward. i better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

i then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. i caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. even showed him my econ 301 notes to prove i couldn't make this shit up. he just laughed and said the same thing ""this is a new one for me."" turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. same with the midterms. they were relevant because it was obviously a level above what i was supposed to be doing and the only thing i got wrong was the building code. they were both classroom 112, just different buildings. so basically i just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. wish me luck tomorrow!

tldr; i was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until i finally realized. then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. crazy coicidences all around.

edit: well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""you made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". the exam is in a couple hours and i will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but i had fun and went to tiesto's birthday in vegas amongst other kool stuff. life goes on.

2. i was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and i had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). so i do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. he did everything on the board and there were online notes but i figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. i highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. it's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. i've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so i'm sure it will turn out fine. it'll be a funny story at grad when i get my ring.

thanks for all the support too. :) making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

edit 2: just got back from the exam.. i didn't crush it but there is no way i didn't pass. it was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. the prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""i usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm i will take the average to make up that first exam."" so all in all i survived and live to fight another day.

just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. i will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. in the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. but somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - cz

"ive been on the run for 7 and a half years.. i stopped reporting to my parole officer in 2011. i recently had a beautiful baby. tomorrow i'm turning myself in. can't be a father if i'm a wanted man. i have 12 years hanging over my head. i've never experienced abject terror before today. i'll never be able to say that sentence again. i'm not even sure why i'm posting. i have a great support network, but i'm still terrified. of the consequences. of losing everything. of missing the beginning of my child's life. i don't fear prison. prison is actually the easiest part of all this. when i went to prison the first time, i just didn't care. now i have everything to lose. i'm stepping off a cliff with no idea where i'll land...

edit: there has been concern that i'm going to prison for 12 years. for clarity 12 years is how much parole i have left. under state law 6 is the max i can receive. more likely it will be 1-3 based on several factors. no new charges, turning myself in, new child.

i commented this but wanted to post it up top so people would see them. 

jesus christ on a motorbike i didn't expect this to blow up the way it did.

first i want to address the ""you deserve what you get"" and ""you're a terrible person"" crowd. trust me. i'm more aware of those facts than you could ever be. i was a coward. until i walk through those doors tomorrow, i still am a coward. i am a piece of shit. but with the family and friends i have on my side, i won't be for long.

for all the folks wishing me luck, sending me messages, and generally showing empathy to a man undeserving: thank you from every piece of my heart. sometimes the internet's not such a bad place.

as for updates. my brother has expressed that he is willing to post them from this account over the next few weeks as the process works itself out. so it won't be me directly, but they'll be here.

finally. to answer a couple common questions:

1. ""how did you make it seven years?"" i didn't break the law, kept my head down, and was, for all intents and purposes, barring the absconding, a model citizen. no one ever had a reason to question me.

2. ""why not stay on the run?"" this may be hard for someone on the outside to understand, but the life i currently live is a life of constant fear. a purgatory. a half life. my daughter has made me see that i need more. i need freedom. which may seem contrary to going to prison, but jail or prison is just the first step in a longer game plan. one that sees me as a real model citizen, the best father i can be, and lord willing, the best husband a woman could hope for.

3. ""what were your crimes?"" like i've mentioned, i am actively avoiding specificity, but the long and short is i committed several crimes over several weeks, and it culminated in me fighting a cop and hurting him when he tried to arrest me.

4. ""have you ever talked to the cop and apologized?"" i have not. i hope to one day, but first thing first is getting my shit together. an apology from an on the run convicted criminal doesn't mean much.

5. ""what about your wife/woman?"" i am hopeful. she seems committed to helping me through this. i hope to make us work. but if time has other plans she will always have my love and respect. both as the mother of my child and the woman who helped me to grow into the kind of man that's ready to face his failures and grow as a human, and a parent.

that's all i got for now. i might add a final note before i go in tomorrow. if not my brother will update when new news is to be had.

"warning: at&t applying ""customer loyalty speed upgrades"" without customer consent. so over the holiday i received an email with an order confirmation from at&t (my isp, and the only one available in my area) and it had a new bill amount (about $5/month higher).

i haven't ordered anything so the first thing i thought was maybe someone got a hold of my account number or personal info and changed it. i immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. i had a notification that showed that at&t had ""upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge""(https://imgur.com/lruuetx)

obviously i was annoyed by this, so i dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. i then found this alert showing that the ""promotional discount"" for this so-called ""customer loyalty speed upgrade""(https://imgur.com/ptyazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. 

i then looked at my bill and found that they had upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent(https://imgur.com/thjwb7j), under the guise of ""customer loyalty"", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most isps occasionally do. 

i immediately called and spoke to a rep named jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that at&t was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. i don't for one second believe this was accidental. i believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.

make sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. i'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and i don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me, but i do feel like at&t should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so i wanted to post to show everyone what happened. if this is the wrong place to post, please suggest a better sub. this was just the closest thing i could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.

**edit:** since there were a couple questions about my last login, the 2015 date is inaccurate. i usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so i could make the post easier w/ images etc. not sure why it's showing 2015 as my last login as i'm pretty sure i didn't even have at&t then lol ... anyway, here's the email i received, dated 12/30/17, so this is definitely a current thing(https://i.imgur.com/i7w1vpu.png)

**edit 2:** since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here's what i did: you should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that i got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month's bill manually, then let autopay resume. as others have noted in the comments always watch your bill closely!

>oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. it was popular until 10 years ago, and it's almost unheard of today. i wasn't aware that at&t was experiencing slam sales today. 

>you can protect your account from slam sales. all the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. call at&t, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. you can setup either a password or a pin that must be entered to make any account changes.

and another pm:

>i also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account pin/password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts. pretty much every isp and cable company uses outdated billing software from the 80's that's a glorified as400 mainframe running with a 90's era gui overlay. scroll about halfway down in this(http://www.makotek.net/intranet/forms/icoms%20technician%20guide.pdf) pdf for some screenshots.

rm= roommate's mom   r=roommate

i came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and rm and r were in the kitchen making some coffee. she has never been there this early before. 

i decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. i atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (in brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points i listed:

1. i appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but i want to do that on my own. i love to cook and felt that i was never allowed in my own kitchen. i also told her that i want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. i don't want her in my room. i reminded her that i talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why i put the lock on the door.

3. i told her that if she wants to be with r, to let r text me and lmk that rm would be in the apartment. 

they expressed understanding and i hugged it out with rm. 

before going to class, i put a load of laundry. my friend is having a birthday dinner today, and i decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. i asked rm multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. i told her that i would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when i finish mine later this afternoon if needed (i didn't want her touching my clothes). she was okay with it and said r didn't have laundry today. cool. i left feeling really relieved, but i still locked my bedroom door. 

i got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and i couldn't find my white dress. as soon as i came home, r looked nervous. my clothes were in the dryer, and i didn't do that for a fact. rm states that i put them in the dryer and just forgot. ughhh. i locked myself in my room, and i know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

when i was in my room, i heard rm talking to r in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. in india, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" and she went on to tell r that i won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

i honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? i'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

i'm heading over to my parents right now and i'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. i'll keep you posted.

final update:

i first want to say thank you to everyone who commented and said wonderful things. i got a lot more responses than i had thought i would, so i apologize for not responding to so many of you. 

my sister actually survived longer than the doctors anticipated, but she passed away on september 1st. it's been a very hard couple of days and i've been grieving, as has my family. 

we were able to use a lot of your ideas and play board games, take pictures, laugh and share stories. i was able to hold her hand and kiss her as she went. she was given pain medicine and went peacefully. 

i wanted to say thank you to one redditor who actually sent us board games to play. she normally felt pretty lethargic, but she did get to play and enjoyed it. we will continue to play these games as a family, and think fondly of when she played with us.

"my(23f) boyfriend(25f) left me on the side of the road and i deserved it.. my amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. he was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. after we were done we left, and we were about half way home when i asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. he said something like ""haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. my stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""c'mon, please? i want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. after that i kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than i deserve, he's firm and says no. i give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. apparently i pulled harder than i thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. to make things worse, he just bought this car. the driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). they didn't even exchange any information. while he's being yelled at, i don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something i did. when he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. his entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. to try and break the tension a little, i say ""well, that could've gone a lot worse."" as soon as i say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. i've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment i did. he looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. i got out and he sped off. it was starting to get dark and i was in a stretch of woods. it took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when i got there him and all his stuff was gone.

i feel so horrible. i cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. we've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now i don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. i've been getting texts like ""wtf"" and ""what the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so i think he's told them what happened. 

it seems like everybody's mad at me. is there any way to fix this? how can i apologize to them when all our friends are siding with him?",7
"mother took 500$ dollars from my account to pay tithing that i said i don't want to pay. so my parents are heavily mormon and we just recently had a tithing settlement and when they asked me if i had paid my tithing i told them no. they then asked me if i had a plan to fix that and i told them that i worked too hard just to give that money away.

anyways so afterwards, my mom, who is my account co-owner as i am under 18, decided to take 10% of my bank account out and refuses to give it back.

this isn't legal right?

*update: i plan to slowly over the next few days, withdraw the money over time. i will leave some in as to not look suspicious. i will try talking to my mom about paying the 500$ just to keep her on my good side. 

*update 2: ok now this has gotten ridiculous.

turns out my dad is sick of my mom overspending so he did two things. he's stopped paying tithing himself and swapped my moms credit card for a debit card. my mom took my money to pay off tithing for him and she gave me roughly 200$ back. she said she'll give me the rest back and that she's still disappointed in me for not paying my tithing. i'm at a loss what to do next.

*update 3: doesn't sound like i'm getting my money back any time soon, both my parents are in a significant amount of debt, my parents fought a lot yesterday apparently. my mom spent almost 10,000$ on stuff for the past month or so. my dad has started making cuts in our budget to fix this, tithing being one of them. 

i'm still following through with taking my money and putting it in a place where my parents can't touch it. just in case they get any ideas.",2

"meta you can still be the asshole if you were wronged. i've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, i've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. op was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? and there is a resounding chorus of nta! you don't owe anyone anything! or someone was mean to op, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. aita?  no! they were rude so you get to be as well! 

i dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. these reactions are understandable. but just because its understandable doesn't mean op can't be the asshole. 

being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. people make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  it is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown.

"i (21f) found a hidden camera in my house. i suspect my sil (26f) put it there to watch me while i babysit my nephew (1m). what do i do?. i babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm mon-fri for free because a) i love my brother and nephew and b) i'm already a sahm for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, i have everything he needs already at home and i love kids. 

the spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. there is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv i found a weird circular object with a lens in it. after some googling i found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. i flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. he vehemently denied it and suggested i called the police and explain to them that i need a bug check. the only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my sil; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and bro and our parents only come on the weekends. i suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. another reason i suspect sil is because i had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" it could be a coincidence, but now that i found the camera i'm not so sure.


if it's her, she knows i know since i'm assuming she saw me find it. what do i do? do i confront her and ask if its hers? i couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; i have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. i would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care i take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course i treat my nephew the same.",7

"i raised my credit score by 73 points in 3 months and got myself out of debt thank to this subreddit. i know i still have work to do but i wanted to share my small success story and some gratitude to this sub for helping me get my finances back on track. 

in late 2013 i was out of work for several months due to an illness, and just a few weeks after i returned to work my husband was laid off. i had a small emergency fund but medical bills and keeping the rent paid on time meant that i was left with some sizable amounts of debt, some of which went to collections. i ignored my credit through 2014 and 2015, since i honestly didn't know how to fix it. 

then i found this subreddit. i read every post that seemed at all relevant to my situation, and read all of the amazing information provided here. towards the end of 2016 i finally decided that i was ready to fix my situation and get back on track. 

in october i signed up for credit karma. my credit score was a dismal 590. i thought it was insurmountable, but i took it one step at a time. i treated it like a game -- every sunday i would log on to ck (as well as several other score providers) to see how many points i ""earned"" that week. 

to start, i found a few old collections accounts that were either inaccurate or were being reported past my state's statute of limitations, and disputed them. to my surprise, the very next week every single one of them had been removed from my report. there is still one small $200 collection account on my report (one that wasn't disputed because i legitimately owe it), which i plan on tackling next. 

i now make a good salary but frequently found myself low on funds at the end of the month, due to poor budgeting. i signed up for mint and monitored all of my spending to see where my money was going. i cut cable, stopped eating out so much, and cut some other unnecessary expenses. coupled with taking on some extra side work on evenings and weekends when i could, i was able to put over $1,000 a month into savings, when previously i struggled to save even 1/10 of that. 

next, i tackled my credit card debt. i started with about $2,800 in credit card debt, which isn't very much but my utilization was near 90%. every extra dollar i had went to those two cards until they were paid off. i paid off the lowest balance first, since the interest rates were the same for both cards. seeing that first $0 balance reported to my credit report was really nice. once my utilization was under 50% i called capitalone and requested a credit line increase, which they provided, taking my utilization down to 31%. i continued paying down my debt aggressively and now have 0% utilization across both cards. it took about 6 weeks to pay these off due to my new aggressive budgeting strategy. 

finally, i called my credit union (car loan) and asked them if they would be willing to remove any of the late payments that were reported during my unemployment, because it can't hurt to ask. to my surprise, they listened to me, saw that my payments had been current since i started working again, and removed 3 late payments from my report as a ""good will"" adjustment. i still have 3 late payments reported, but 3 is better than 6. 

today when i logged in to credit karma my score was 663. all of my credit card debt is paid off, my car loan will be paid off in 3-4 months and i was able to replenish my emergency fund *and* start saving towards a down payment for a house. 

seriously cannot thank this sub enough. i've never posted here before but i must have read every single post here over the past 3-4 months, and just wanted you to know that i'm grateful to those of you who take the time to answer questions and help people get their lives back on track. 

happy new year! 

**a small edit since this post got a little more attention than i anticipated! (wow,  thanks everyone :))** 

first, i have gotten some pms and comments assuming that this post was some sort of ad for ck, and i assure you it isn't (lol). credit karma was one of several score services i utilized, and i initially signed up since i saw it mentioned so frequently on this sub. i mentioned it by name simply because it was the service i used (& continue to use) most frequently. i've also received some messages from people who, for some reason, don't believe that my post is true, and that was certainly unexpected. if the mods are amenable i would be happy to post screenshots with personal information redacted. the purpose of this post was to remind everyone that a series of seemingly small steps forward can make a bigger difference in a smaller amount of time than you might expect. 

i also appreciate the advice to check my ""real"" fico score. i did that this morning and to my delight it was actually 667, so a couple points higher than my ck score :) 

i'm very humbled to hear that my story was inspirational to some of you, and wish everyone great success in the new year! ",10
"aita? my husband and i are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. his mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but i don't want to do that.. my stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and i decided that we will be getting him a car. i make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. that's fine with me.

his mother is a woman who i make the effort to be civil with but don't like. i am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. she called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. we are not friends and i won't even describe her as nice to me.

when my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

i don't want to do that. i don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. i don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but i don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

i don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. and i don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

i know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. i'm civil to his mom and i never talk negatively about her to him. is that not enough? am i incapable of being a good step mother to him if i'm not best friends with his mom? do i have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",3

"update, my son took the boba fett figure.. so, i never honestly expected the post i made to get where it did. i also never expected the barrage of support and hate. i will say these past 48 hours have been a ride and that post has not helped in any way.

&#x200b;

so, why am i back? well, because i feel like i need to be. i'm not here to give some apology to a bunch of internet strangers for how i acted or seek validation. i'm here because i feel that for myself i need to admit my own wrongs and move on to a better place.

&#x200b;

so, i want to talk about something first before i get into the update. many people who responded talked about how me or my brother in a bad light, and with how i reacted in the comments it didn't help the situation. i was also hit pretty hard for how i was not taking my brother into consideration when talking about the issue. to give some context for this, me and my brother have never had a good relationship. we have never seen eye to eye and after our fathers death he cut contact with me for a good amount of time. we're just to different in some senses. he's a single nerdy guy who has no aspiration for family while i'm the exact opposite. in these past few years we've tried to fix this. work as adults to bring what little family we have back together. during our time apart he began collecting old nerdy things, and i wont lie i never understood the appeal. it is his life though and he can do what he wants.

&#x200b;

so, when my son stole and damaged his property i didn't see how it was valuable to him and discounted it. so when he asked for 2,000 to fix it i really didn't feel like it was worth it. was this wrong of me? maybe. i don't feel bad about defending my son, i only feel bad that i discounted my brother in the process.

&#x200b;

sorry about that. like i said, i don't want sympathy. i only wrote that out to allow myself to be true about the situation. back to the update.

so, after all was said and done, my family had pretty much been thrown into chaos. i had no idea what i was going to do and after talking with my wife, we decided we would take many of your advice and have my son pay him back. we collected all the non-essentials he had and planned to sell them to raise funds. during this time i got back into contact with my brother and wanted to talk this out to make sure this did not end badly. i offered to pay in full.

(also, some people in the comments said that the figure was worth less so i asked him. he had it professionally valued a few months ago when he bought it and it's was worth a total of 2,200$.)

my brother said he plans to not sue us. his renters insurance apparently is willing to pay him the value he has listed, but he would need to file a police report to get it. at first we agreed not to go that route and simply pay him the value of it or one for a replacement if he could get it cheaper. this was the plan until last night.

during the process of taking his things away, my wife found a conversation he had with a friend he has over the internet. it turns out my son stole the figure to sell. he had googled it while we were at my brothers house and found out how much it was worth and bragged to a friend that he was going to sell it at a pawn shop. he didn't realize that taking it out of the package would ruin it so he ripped it out to hid in the car better.

suffice to say, i am not happy about this. i won't elaborate on this very much more but me and my wife have decided that what is best for all of us is that we let him face the consequences of this. my brother is going to file a police report and collect money from insurance. some may say this is a bit harsh, but honestly i think this might be for the best in the end. the way my son actively stole from family to make a profit worries me and i believe the only option that i can live with myself making is this. i will stand by my son till the need, but he needs to learn now before he is an adult.

so, thank you all for the advice. the support and hate are what i needed as a true wake up call. like i said, i don't need pity. i'm doing this so that i can be true to myself, and maybe become a better parent in the end.",2
"heads up: the federal government just filed suit against navient, claiming they scammed millions of borrowers between 2010-2015 to the tune of $4 billion. this is huge.. the suit was filed january 18th 2017, by the consumer finance protection bureau (cfpb) against navient. 

first, know that the cfpb has requested that the court order navient to comply with the following actions, among others: 

1. restitution to consumers harmed by navient's conduct; 

2. disgorgement of all ill-gotten revenue


here are the details of the allegations: 

from consumer affairs .com(https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/feds-sue-student-loan-servicer-navient-011817.html): 
>specifically, the suit charges that navient:
>> fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts;

>> steers struggling borrowers toward paying more than they have to on loans;

>> obscured information consumers needed to maintain their lower payments;

>> deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and

>> harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans.

from the la times(http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-navient-lawsuit-20170118-story.html): 
>in its lawsuit, the consumer agency alleged many other borrowers had problems enrolling in programs to reduce payments and navient instead steered struggling borrowers into plans that made more money for navient but saddled borrowers with higher costs.

>specifically, the government alleged that navient maintained compensation policies that encouraged customer service representatives to push borrowers into forbearance, which allows borrowers to suspend payments without defaulting but does not stop interest from accruing.

>however, most federal student-loan borrowers earned the right in 2009 to enroll in the less costly payment options that are based on their income.

>although those plans save borrowers money, forbearance was more lucrative for navient, the agency alleged because the company could enroll borrowers in forbearance in less time and with less staff.

>in all, the servicer slapped borrowers with additional interest charges of up to $4 billion by enrolling them in repeated forbearance plans from january 2010 to march 2015, according to the consumer agency. 

if you want to learn more about this, i highly encourage you to read the original complaint filed with the court by the cfpb. it is very readable (not filled with legalese) and reads as an absolutely scathing indictment of a company whose business practices targeted its most vulnerable customers in flagrant violation of the law. 

you can find the original complaint on the consumer finance .gov website(http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201701_cfpb_navient-pioneer-credit-recovery-complaint.pdf). they also summarized the complaint on their website(http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-nations-largest-student-loan-company-navient-failing-borrowers-every-stage-repayment/). 

in the spirit of this sub, i'm sharing this information because there are plenty of people here who may have been a victim of these alleged practices. including myself, as i've been paying down my navient loans since 2012 and have several years to go. 

i'm going to read through the complaint again, and if anything important jumps out at me that i haven't mentioned, i'll update this post. 

**edit:**
additional allegations: 

(since july 2011) disregard of borrower instructions when processing payments submitted by check with written instructions from the borrower specifying how the payment should be applied.

(jan 2010-march 2015) using uncharacteristically vague email titles like ""new document ready to view"" to notify borrowers that they needed to renew their income-based repayment enrollment. during this time, the number of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment regularly exceeded 60% of borrowers and resulting, often, in capitalization of interest. 

**edit:** there is no way to know how potentially impacted borrowers will be affected by the lawsuit. we will have to wait and see. lawsuits of this magnitude often take a long time to get resolved.

"my aunt hit my mother so i dragged her across the floor and punched her till she passed out. my aunt is a poisonous woman. our whole family doesn't talk to her. she's done things in the past you wouldn't believe. so she left our lives years ago. recently she returned out of the blue at my moms house. my mom has 2 other sisters and a brother. my mom and aunt never got on. my mom is a lovely person but she could sense from a young age something was off about her sister, so she kept her distance. 

my aunt was nasty and would hurt people's feeling intentionally for no reason. she never had a partner or kids. she isolated herself from everyone. my gran cut her off when she tried to steal thousands of dollars from her. we all genuinely think there's something physiologically wrong with her. 

so back to where i was going with this....one morning i was at my moms house. just chilling out and there was a knock at the door. so i opened it and there she was. she walked in, she looked like she had took drugs. she looked dead behind the eyes. i tried to stop her but she pushed me down. i honestly don't know why she came to my moms house out of everyone. i quickly got up and she went into the kitchen she startled my mom and punched her in the face, my mom didn't even have a chance to blink before she hit her. she went down like a ton of bricks.

my heart felt like it had been sucked through into my stomach when i seen it. something came over me, i don't know if it was anger or adrenaline, but i ran up behind her and grabbed her hair and i dragged her out onto the back lawn and i bashed her face about 15 times, blood was everywhere. thankfully no one seen me or i might not of been writing this right now. i got up and i left her there. i went to check my mom, she was in a lot of pain. i looked back out the window and she was gone. 

we told our family immediately about this and they were perplexed and angry as to why she just turned up and attacked my mom. i'm still so hurt and angry as i write this. but i also feel tremendously guilty and upset that i done that to her because i've never fought anyone and i'm not a fighter at all, but something came over me and i snapped. 

i can't get over it for some reason. it just seemed so unreal and there was no reason for the attack. god forbid she had a weapon that's truly scary to think about. we didn't call the police. as i assaulted her badly and didn't want it to bounce back on me. that's another thing i feel ashamed about.

but should i feel bad or not? i need others opinions as i've been bottling this up for a while.  

my gran was devastated, she just wanted her daughter back but from a young age she took to drugs, spent time in prison and amount of other things. you can't help someone who doesn't want to be saved. ",11

"my(39m) wife(40f) slapped our daughter (16f) after she came out as gay. i need help dealing with my wife and my daughter.. i'm actually an immigrant from mexico, so my english is average at best. 

i must admit that i was really homophobic and racist growing up. that was how i was raised. but when i moved to america, i met my wife and she helped me a lot. she helped me adjust to this new country and changed my racist and homophobic opinions. i owe that to my wife.

yesterday, my daughter told me that she wanted to talk to me. so we sat down to talk, and she told me that she wanted to bring her girlfriend over for her birthday. it took some time to sink in, but i understood. when i asked her if she was coming out to me, she told me that she was. she asked me if i was fine with it and i told her that i had no problem with her choice and she will always be the same daughter to me. i must admit that i felt proud because my daughter actually trusted me.

after that, i asked her if she wanted to go out for dinner. she told me that she wanted to eat lasagna. i'm a chef and my daughter loves my lasagna. so i started to get ready to prepare it. 

at this point, my wife returned from her sister's house. idk what went down but after a while, my wife started screaming at my daughter. and when i came to look, she slapped my daughter twice. my daughter was crying and i was really shocked. i asked what happened and my wife told me that my daughter came out and she did not agree with her. she told her that she can't be gay and started crying and yelling at her. 

i asked my wife to leave, because i was really angry. after my wife left i told my daughter that what my wife did was incredibly wrong and i'll stand by her. my daughter did not talk much, she just went to her room.

now, my wife refuses to talk to me. she told me that she will be back only if i agree to help my daughter become straight. idk what to make out of this. i'm really notnthat educated along these lines and all this is very new to me. i love both of them very much and i'd like to help diffuse this situation. can i get some advice here?",7
"my dad just figured out he's been paying $30/month for aol dial-up internet he hasn't used for at least the last ten years.. the bill was being autopaid on his credit card. i think he was aware he was paying it (i'm assuming), but not sure that he really knew why. or he forgot about it as i don't believe he receives physical bills in the mail and he autopays everything through his card.

he's actually super smart financially. budgets his money, is on track to retire next year (he's 56 now), uses a credit card for all his spending for points, and owns approximately 14 rental properties. 

i don't think he's used dial up for at least the last 10....15 years? anything he can do other than calling and cancelling now?

edit: aol refused to refund anything as i figured, and also tried to keep on selling their services by dropping the price when he said to cancel. 

i got a little clarification on the not checking his statement thing: he doesn't really check his statements. or i guess he does, but not in great detail. my dad logs literally everything in quicken, so when he pays his monthly credit card bill (to which he charges pretty much everything to) as long as the two (payment due and what he shows for expenses in quicken) are close he doesn't really think twice. he said they've always been pretty close when he compares the two so he didn't give it second thought.

"my ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), i was starting to heal until i found out the reasons why he ghosted.. the past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. i'm not sure if i'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

my ex, 'tom', and i had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so i thought. we had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). i was happy, and i thought he was too. we had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, i could go on. 

everything was fine until our last trip together. we went to a destination where i had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something i'd have to wait longer to do. it was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

after we landed (the last time i saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. i didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. i tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. i started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. from there our communication basically broke down. i can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. from that point i'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. after about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then i wouldn't hear from him for several more days. what hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with new years, valentine's day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

i felt like i was going crazy. i had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  i was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. i stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. i found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse i could think of whenever i showed up somewhere without him. 

i eventually broke down, i contacted one of his good friends who i felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. i told her that tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and i have no idea what's going on. i told her i didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that i needed to know about. she looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and i that i was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. this was soul crushing to hear and i felt humiliated and worthless. i told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. she said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

throughout march and april i felt like i was starting to heal some. i felt broken, but i started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. i told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. then i found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

he had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. not sure how long, but a little less than a year. i'm also hurt because i know the person he cheated on me with. she's an absolute garbage person. and i'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. she has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. i've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the lgbt community and non-christians. she is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. she somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. i think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, i'm really not sure. i can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. i've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. her parents have paid for her car and i think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. she spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and i frequent and will interject herself into our outings. she has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew i wouldn't approve. then he started to get high and then have sex with her. he felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. his intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. this woman hated my guts, and kept pushing tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. he didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. so she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. he came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

i only found out about this, because the same friend i had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that i deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. there is no way in hell that i'd get back together with tom
2. i can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and i'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

i don't know what to do at this point. i'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. i don't know if i could contain my urge to slap him, or if i would just break down and sob. i was doing well from moving on from him. i was starting to feel happy again. now, i think i'm back at square 1. i'm depressed and stressed out. 

is there anything i can do? i kind of want to stay hidden in my apartment not answering calls until this is all over.",7
"i made my brother think he has alopecia for the last fifteen years.. this is probably the pettiest thing i have ever done, and i regret it to this day. when i was fifteen years old, i got my first job and started to have some money of my own. i used my money to spoil myself and purchased nicer thing like clothes, shoes, makeup and salon brand shampoo.

my brother used to sneak into my bathroom and constantly steal my nice shampoo. he would use them and most of the time he would leave them open in the bathtub. this would result in the rest of the shampoo going down the drain and leave me with empty containers.

this drove me completely insane and i hated him for taking my things. i tried to speak with my parents about this, but they told me that i should just learn to share.

one day i went out and purchased hair removal cream. i mixed this into my shampoo bottle and left it in my bathroom. i gave him a verbal warning not to use my newly purchased bottle, but he stole it again anyway. over the next few days his hair slowly started to fall out and small bald patches started to appear.

seeing what i had done i immediately emptied the remaining shampoo. i felt terrible and i truly didn't think it would have as a dramatic effect as it did. my mother took him to the doctor to get check out and they diagnosed him with alopecia. he than had to start using this special and terrible smelling shampoo to combat this.  

his hair did grow back but i just recently found out that he is still using the shampoo in order to prevent another alopecia flair up. it has been 15 years now and i have never told my brother that i caused him to lose his hair.

edit:

some people are asking why i let this go on for 15 years. i honestly had no idea that he was still using the shampoo and just assumed he stopped at some point or that the doctor had told him he didn't have alopecia. 

i just helped him move over the weekend and found a fresh bottle of the shampoo in his bathroom. i completely forgot about this until now.

edit 2:

he lived in the basement in the mother in law suite. so it did take a lot of effort for him to come in my second floor private bathroom to steal my shampoo and conditioner. not trying to defend my poor decision but he didn't just happen to use it by mistake. i didn't just leave my things lying around.",11

"by teaching my baby sign language. i go to this ""mommy and me"" thing every week with my daughter. not because it's my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as ""a christmas gift"" to my one-year-old (aka she doesn't think i am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. but all these kids know sign language, and i thought that was pretty damn cool. so i start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! she can call me mom and my husband, dad! holy shit! thanks pinterest moms! i take back all the shit i talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

well today with my husband out of town, i didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants i decided to go out for a quick dinner. the kid loves french fries and so do i. so we hit the local burger joint and i order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. the server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and i set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. so of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". and every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. ok, whatever. 

well i notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. i'm like okay, i did like 4 quick google searches, maybe i botched some of what i taught her. it's fine. but then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iphone down with a message typed out for me to read. it says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

i'm like... wait... what? so she continues to show me that i have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since i am her mom. i can only imagine what the pinterest moms would've done had i shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

tl;dr asl is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

eta: thanks, everyone! i'm glad you all enjoyed this post. please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that i was trying to teach my child proper asl. they were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as asl. they just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

also please note that i literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. i have no idea how close they were to the real signs. additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. she speaks english well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. we were always sure to say the words while signing them. she now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that i decided to share with you all. i'm new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen ""today"". you can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)",4

"there needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before i even begin to give a shit about fat acceptance for women.. perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but i'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but i talk to gay men a lot. (i've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

i don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. how emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. my size isn't great either but i've come to accept it, however, i know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

when i see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, i laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. a man can't. a woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. why should i focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

the rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. while it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

edit: as an addendum, i'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

all i can say is fuck most of you. you treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. it was luck of the god damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. while the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. even though i accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) i know i could have it a lot worse and many men do. i still have it in the back of my mind that whoever i'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. i'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**edit 2: i would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

i didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. i'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

firstly i'd like to address this ludicrous notion that i hate women. i dont know how i can prove to any of you that i dont hate women other than me saying i dont. i may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. my problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

i understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. no one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. my main point was i believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **i never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) i simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. i get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. but from where i'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case i apologize and acknowledge my fault. and before anyone addresses it, i'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. that was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and i used penis size as an example. what i really want is inclusivity. of everyone. 

another topic i'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" while i understand the logic, i dont really see how its productive. sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. many of us crave it, strive for it. make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. when a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. if left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. i understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. but i feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. which is why i'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. but i feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. and i agree with that, but all i'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

i obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but i believe i'm a bit of an idealist. for better or worse, i sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. many thought i was an asshole in my post and i would agree with that. i admit i'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why i dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. many suggested that i should start the movement myself, but i'm simply not the right person for the job. i'm hot headed, i sometimes don't think before i speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. i'm a private person, despite how i am online with anonymity, in real life i am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. i also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. i see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" i knew there would be opposition to this post and i was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. perhaps rightly so, because i'm a bit of a dick. but love me or hate me, i stand by most of what i said. 

i sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. supporting one particular group. (culturally speaking i'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) i care about people despite what many of you may believe. and all i really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

the last major point i'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. i'll admit that sure, i wish i had a bigger dick. i feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part i can tolerate it. i've had partners who didn't care and i genuinely believe them. i know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. so you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

one last thing is i really do appreciate the discussion. there are a lot of points i strongly disagree with that i didn't address here, and there are many ideas i really should think over and reevaluate myself. and i thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",6

# best of the best

*obviously, these are my personal opinions.  this is not financial advice for your situation and you should do your own research before applying for any cards*

## best all categories cash back

### if spending < $1,000 / mo.
**citi doublecash** 2% interest with no annual fee and no restrictions makes this my current catch-all card.

### if spending > $1,000 / mo.
**alliant cu signature visa** if you plan to spend more than $11,800 / yr on this card then 2.5% cash back more than covers the $59 annual fee, especially in the first year when all purchases receive 3% cash back.

## categories

### you choose

**us bank cash+** select 2 categories of your choice and receive 5% cash back up to $2,000 / qtr is just about the best i found anywhere.  pretty much the only way i found to beat this is with a small army of cards dedicated to separate categories.

### dedicated
**costco** and **amazon** amazon nets 5% and costco nets 4% back total on purchases with those retailers if you have a membership.  so if you already have a membership and frequently shop at costco / amazon both of those cards seem like pretty good deals as well.

## promos

### by %
**chase freedom unlimited**, **us bank cash+**, & **bank of america cash rewards** all offer $150 when you spend $500 in the first 3 months which is an astounding 30% back!

### by $
despite the annual fee **capital one savor** offers a $500 promo if you think you are going to spend more than $3,000 in the first 3 months.  personally i am not a fan of the annual fee associated with this card, but if you are just about those promo offers, $500 is nothing to scoff at.

# summary

selfishly, i made this list for myself as i was deciding which cards to apply for.  i already have strong credit, but i wanted to find cards that i could keep open long term to build my credit as my lifestyle changes, so my #1 rule was ""no annual fees.""  without an annual fee there is no penalty to keeping the account open by purchasing a snickers once / qtr so my average account age can grow.  while there are a few cards with annual fees that have nice benefits, i personally didn't find that they wound up outweighing the chance that my lifestyle would change or a better card would come along and i would need to close the account.

**personally, i wound up applying for the citi doublecash & us bank cash+**.  if i find that i am spending more than $1,000 on the citi doublecash i will probably apply for the alliant signature visa since i will be over the breakeven point.  as for the us bank cash+, i really like this card because i can see keeping it open for quite a long time due to it's great rewards and flexibility to adapt to life changes.

*please let me know if i made any mistakes or if you have a better card that should be on this list!*

edit: 

i can't keep up with all the comments so i am just going to list suggestions here without all the details

- uber visa -$0 fee - 4% restaurants \ 3% travel \ 2% online purchases \ 1% everything else
- paypal - $0 fee - 2.0% back 
- alliant platinum rewards - $0 fee - 2% back
- capital one savorone - $0 fee - dining & entertainment",10

"a bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer. a bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. this means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually one teacher and one drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. i think it is.

furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. for those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

ps: i am not defending drug dealing, i am just comparing it to teachers.

edit: i appreciate so much the work that passionate teachers make and the incredibly positive impact they've had on my life and the ones of billions of people. this post is about bad teachers, but i have to make it clear good teachers exist too.",6
"nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. long time la reader here, and i'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. when i'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

early in november we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend i'll call aaron (because his name's aaron and i think he's being an idiot) had bought on ebay. we had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

it'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. i'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. there was no way i'd go through the water as it looked, but because i'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river i didn't want to risk it. i didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. i said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

aaron decided to push on and started moving and i panicked and got straight out. it was far more water than i'd had to go through when i near lost my car and life before. i got out well before the water though so i didn't let water in the car btw.

aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. he was extremely lucky not to drown, and i ran down & helped him out. immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. admittedly i'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of ebay parts in the back so it's not like i'd have made much difference.

we phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. we haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. but on friday i received a letter from a lawyer i know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. it's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because i made the car unsafe by getting out. it was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

i think he's being a dickhead. someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? ideally i'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what i think they'll be. i want to contact his lawyer to tell them aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should i get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

"if ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for ""free"", search for ""open source"" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware. the reasoning being if you type ""free"", generally you will be advertised to or get the lite version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to.

open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

this has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

edit: just because it was mentioned, being open source doesn't mean that a program is virus-free, but it is a substantially lower risk than closed-source software. either way, you would be better off with open-source in general.

i am assuming you will be excising a modest amount of caution with what you download by checking it against trusted reviewers/communities.

edit 2:

as this thread has gained a lot of traction let's address some points: yes, we know you can torrent a paid-for application. hilarious as it is for you to keep posting it, you don't need to tell us. open source is still valid for those of us who believe in privacy, transparency and actually supporting a developer. we are aware of pirating websites, i promise.

"my fiance just got unexpectedly fired today and we're both now reminded why r/personalfinance is always insisting on trying to live off one income.. we were both blindsided by today. we're both pretty young, early on in our careers, he had only been there a year and was performing. it was a huge shock. we don't practice every best habit of the sub but we're grateful we picked up doing your best to live off one income.

we just bought our house in august and insisted on going through the pre-approval process off my income alone.  our lights will stay on because our bills are effectively scaled to one income as well. we held off on car payments and continued to drive our beaters because the numbers for new used cars didn't make sense with one income.

my only regret is not building up our emergency fund more (one month saved but we should've had at least three), so if you're reading this, definitely do that.

anyways, thanks to the sub for the constant advice on living below your means and always being prepared. i came to thank you all, not lecture. and encourage people who are following this thought process and are using a second income for the ""extra stuff"" - you're doing great. today sucked but it could've been so much worse.

we're counting our blessings and the job search begins tomorrow.

&#x200b;

**edit:** thanks everyone for the encouragement and well-wishes. this obviously isn't the only thing going on in our lives, so the messages to keep going were greatly appreciated. 

for those of you who are in hcol areas or other situations where living off one income isn't possible, i totally understand - the intent of this post wasn't to shame anyone into anything. we live in a mcol city in the south and are in the tech sector so it was doable for us. we're also not beacons of perfection of this sub and are still working on breaking bad financial habits every day. 

for those of you who took this as a self pat-on-the-back post, i can see that. the intent really was to see the silver lining of things and encourage others who are perhaps considering this type of budgeting method. but i understand how fast this sub gets into circle-jerking and self-congratulating and didn't mean to purpose this thread for that. just hoping to reduce the amount of ""we're in deep shit from one event that could've had a much lower impact"" posts by showing anything can happen at any time and that even then, we weren't as prepared as we should've been.",10

"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?. when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

three nights ago my parents and i got in a huge fight. i am not a christian. they are extreme bible thumpers. i am bisexual, they believe i'm going to be burning in hell. i was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. 

i managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. we just moved to this state so i have no friends. my siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. my related family is all thousands of miles away. last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. right now i am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and american bulldog, sleeping in my car. my parents forced me to quit my job last week so i could focus more on school. last night i checked my bank account. my parents drained the 1k savings i had in it. it is completely empty. 

i'm just scared and don't know where to turn. i primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. i do not want to give them up but i'm not sure how much longer i can without neglecting them. giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. i will not give up on them easily. having them around has protected me from many bad situations.

"for telling my parents i won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?. i'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. i have a car that i bought with money i'd saved from work, and i pay my own gas. however my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

they said i need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. and the problem is that i get motion sick easily; even when i'm driving. too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when i'm in a car make me feel ill too.

i'm not exaggerating, i've always been like this. as a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. i always make sure i know where my barf bag is on a plane. i always used to take motion sickness pills, but i'm not allowed when i'm driving because they make you tired.

anyway, i can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me i literally feel so sick because of his bo. even with the windows on my side open

my friend told me i should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

so i did that and told my mom and dad that i couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. either they could check or i would. and they blew up at me saying that i was being nasty and humiliating, that if i wouldn't drive my brother i couldn't drive. and i said fine; i'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

and that caused a big fight, because i guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

"for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?. i am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. they're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

my sister paula's daughter amy is the most successful of the bunch. she's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

i don't dislike amy but she's always been trouble. i have a daughter the same age as her, charlotte. when they were younger amy did a great job convincing charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

when amy graduated, paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then paula has gone out of her way to make amy the centre of attention everywhere. over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. amy wanted to go too and paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from x''. amy behaved like a brat the entire time and paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. i don't mind this but they do, but once again paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

the final straw came last weekend. my son mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. paula, her husband rob, and amy were there, and paula set about trying to convince me to let amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. mark's fiancee vicky barely knows amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. paula said amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

i was frustrated and told paula that amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. i told paula amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying i was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public.

"update: my 20 fiance's 27m behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship. i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as i felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. a lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

i spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who i am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. she expressed some concern and agreed that i should speak with fiance's brother. fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. that sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because i went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because i didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. i got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because i was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. i just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. i knew that something really needed to change.

the next day fiance left for work and i left for school just as usual. i called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and i basically told him that i had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that i was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if i wanted to speak with him. i was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. i hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. i was extremely nervous and felt like i was doing something sneaky and horrible, but i needed to know what was going on. i spoke with his manager and learned that he had quit his job weeks ago!! he told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. wtf! so i guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. after work i went home and fiance was gaming. i told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. he finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. i was literally shaking at this point and told him that i was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. i said that i was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. i said that i was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. at this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. so i did something stupid and stood in front of the tv and said that i knew about him quitting his job to game all day. he flipped out. he got violent and pushed me away from the tv. there was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). i got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. he eventually came and apologized. he offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. i literally felt sick. i locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. he literally just kept gaming until i went to sleep.

the next day i couldn't go to school because i had a bad black eye, it was not something i could explain away. i wanted to just disappear. i got on the bus and went to the women's center. my cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad i looked. i was very adament that i don't want to press charges or anything, i just needed help with the next steps of getting away. the social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. she helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while i drafted and sent fiance a text stating that i cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. he called me nearly 20 times during the time i was at the center. i didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. for the short term i am staying with my cousin and her husband and i'm working on finding an apartment. next month i'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. i still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like i'm living in a nightmare. but for the past week or so i haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. i've also gone to bed before 11 every night. someone on here sent me a pm saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so i'm just glad i was able to get away when i did. 

i don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and i just wanted to put this out here.",7

"for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?. i work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

i told them ""you might want to cut that out! llamas spit in self-defense."" but they kind of laughed my warning off.

now, i knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. but i decided not to tell them about that. i figured if they persisted, i'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

the llama was being patient. at one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. it got the girl square in the face. she dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that i was in.

to make things worse for them, i didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! it was a slow day, so i just locked the doors. i told them i didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

aita? the girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. maybe it was...i knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but i wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",3
"tifu- by not knowing about sunblock expiration dates. i applied spf 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. i was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

i pretty much had no idea that i had a problem until i scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. i considered for a split second that i had a burn but like an idiot, i rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

the blisters formed by the next day and i started reading the can to see if i missed something about applying it. i found the customer service number and called it. before talking to anyone, i heard a recording tell me that the fda doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. this bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

i had no clue. 

i went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

it was easily one of the most painful things i have ever experienced. except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. i soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


this was preventable- sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions.

edit- i want to clear up: i'm naturally, very pale person, i was at high altitude while on and in the water. i do not blame anyone but myself for this. whether expired or i stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. i should have been careful with making sure the things i use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
i agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, i just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
this isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

i'm not planning to sue anyone although i appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
i just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! be safe! skin cancer is a real danger.

"by taking lsd and pretending to be french for 10 months. throwaway for reasons.
tl;dr at the bottom.

so this was more of a fu that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

about 11 months ago i moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until i could get the money together to sort something out properly, i was hoping to have already moved out by this point. on my second day after i'd finished unpacking i decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, i'd brought some with me that i'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and i quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than i had been told they were, and i thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. so i figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because i was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

so i left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. it's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. i'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. she said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

so basically i do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where i pretend i can't speak english. i remember a few words from my gcse french so i just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. in the state i was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and french just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. my exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and i shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. she pretty much just left me to it after that and i got on my way. i did my walk and got home about two hours later, i was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. when i got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. i tried to keep my head down because i couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so i instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. when i got in i started freaking out straight away because i realised that i'd just become french and now two of the neighbours think i can't speak any english. the next day when i woke up i realised the best thing i could do (as an englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be french for seemingly no reason. 

fast forward 10 months, i still live here, and at this point i'm in deep. my life on this street is a web of lies. i've perfected my french accent and over the course of 10 months french me has learnt a decent amount of english so he can hold disjointed conversation.
i'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and i was the nice quirky french guy on the street. i didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation i had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered i wasn't french. if i had friends come over (i don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. most of them found it amusing, at least. 

things were going okay and i wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because i'd gotten so used to it. i'm not home that much and when i am i rarely leave the house for any reason so i only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when i was out on my street. if anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when i got to take on my french persona. french me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his english was a bit limited.

but then there was the day it all came crashing down. i was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her i didn't recognise. she stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy i was telling you about"". you might be able to see where this is going. 

her friend hits me with a question in french that i didn't understand a word of, and i knew he was actually french straight away because his accent was way better than mine. i didn't know what to do and i just froze. every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause i just decided i had to come clean. i told her i wasn't actually french and couldn't speak french and then i tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke i'd been doing on everyone. nobody was buying that. i fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

i haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which i'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. i make sure nobody is around now whenever i leave the house, and i do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when i get home so that i never come into contact with them. every time i think about the day i was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

tl;dr: pretended to be french to avoid human interaction on lsd, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a french man.

edit: i didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and i'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. some people seem to have a hard time believing that i thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, i'd like to remind people that when i made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",4
"i'm so tired of reddit's uncontrollable need to be the funny man in the comments no matter how serious the post may be.. people on reddit have always had a great sense of humor to me, but sometimes the impulse to insert a joke or a pun or a series of weird strung along comments gets. fucking. old. 

sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. and you just have to give credit where credits due. but lately i've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. sometimes i feel like i should laugh at the cleverness of some. but it happens so often and in so many posts that i find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. not unless there's just a golden moment. i've even begun to roll my eyes the moment i open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. i never roll my eyes. at anything. 

i used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately i've been really turned off by it. maybe i just need a break.


edit: thank you for the gold and silver!  wow. this blew up... i just wanna add something to this. i'm not saying it's bad to have some fun in the comments. one of you pointed out that it's okay to be serious and to have fun. i agree. i'm saying that when i'm intrigued by a post sometimes i really want to see what the reddit community has to say about it... or to see if there's additional information in the comments. but a lot of the time all i see for miles is the repetitive back and forth joking. sometimes i really just wish the top comments had less to do with clever jokes and more to do with the content of that post...

edit: i never talked about acceptance speeches being annoying. i also never gave one. i said thank you. i'm learning real quick that a lot of people don't actually read your posts before commenting. lmao",6

""there are very strict laws on how i can serve drinks. i couldn't serve you half a beer even if i wanted to.""

""oh, alright then. i didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematics""

""are you kidding me?"" the bartender replies, ""you learn limits in like, 9th grade! what kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?""

""he's on to us"" mathematician #1 screeches

simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.

the mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. ""fools"" it booms in unison, ""i will infect every being on this pathetic planet with malaria""

the mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. ""my god, you're right. we didn't think about the economy! very well, we will not attack this dimension. for the taxpayers!"" and with that, they vanish.

a nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. ""how did you know that that would work?""

""it's simple really"" the bartender says. ""i saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative.""",0
"update my grandparents don't approve of my relationship with my black boyfriend, and don't want me (f24) to marry him (26). i don't know what to do, since i don't want to lose either of these people (my boyfriend and my grandparents).. hey guys, thanks for all your responses on my previous post.

it was all really good advice, but the very best out of it all was the suggestion that i come clean to sam. i did that, and he reacted in a surprisingly calm manner. i asked him how he's taking it so well and he told me he's experienced something similar before. 

his cousin had come out as gay a few years back, and he told me how his own grandparents reacted very poorly to his cousins revelation. he told me they absolutely refused to acknowledge the fact that he was gay and said some pretty hurtful stuff along the lines of how his homosexuality would embarrass them in front of all their family and friends etc. they wouldn't allow the cousin to bring his boyfriend to family gatherings, and threatened to cut him out out of their inheritance unless he ""got his head straight"". 

he then showed me pictures of his grandparents laughing along with his cousins husband, pictures of them at his cousins wedding etc. he told me they eventually grew out of it and as they go to know him they really bonded with the guy. 

sam joked that he wouldn't give my grandparents a choice and that within a month they'd be in love with him. 

well i think it's working. sam and i have dinner at my grandparents house every night, and each night i notice them more and more at ease and more avidly taking part in our conversations. sam and my grandpa are both ww2 enthusiasts, and my grandpa absolutely loves having discussions on the subject with sam. 

i decided to update this post because last night something very special happened. i got there before sam, and i could _see the disappointment on their faces when they thought i had come alone_. they asked where sam was, when he was coming etc. then they said we wouldn't start eating until he arrived.

"for refusing to pay back my cousin after my baby ruined her blouse?. hi all. 

i gave birth four weeks ago, and we decided to have a ''baby ceremony'', where everyone gets to meet our lovely daughter charlotte. 

my cousin alice and her parents were among the guests. the first thing i'll say about her is that she has expensive taste. she's the sort of person who has a *minimum* price range for how much she spends on clothing. she doesn't own anything that isn't designer and has some items of clothing that cost thousands. she is a banker and still lives with parents so can afford the lifestyle. 

it was alice's turn to hold the baby and she was happy to at first, but suddenly charlotte vomited on her. alice handed charlotte back to me and ran off crying, and spent the rest of the event crying in the car. i went to see her to apologise but she didn't want to hear any of it. my mum gave her one of her shirts which was too big for her and she felt completely upset and humiliated.

today i got a call from my mum, saying that she'd been on the phone to her sister (alice's mum) saying that they want me to reimburse the cost of the blouse (roughly £1800) since it was completely ruined. 

i have said no. at the end of the day we all know what babies can be like. she took a risk wearing something so expensive knowing a baby was nearby and unfortunately it backfired. i feel bad for her but it was not my fault.

"giving my 17 yr old nephew advice on how to meet women.. a few weeks ago i flew out to fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since i havent seen them in 4 years. the first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. they gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. the conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. the older son ,""alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at hs and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. on the other hand is my nephew ""dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. when i pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and dan. being the cool uncle i let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. as she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my marine corps days. if he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. but dont go empty handed. i suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. now that i think of it i was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. so the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 a few days later it occured to all of us dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. when his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. i however was not buying it. i pulled him aside and got the truth. the boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. he would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. he met a girl and they had been seeing each other. i was happy i could help and could not believe it actually worked. however things went south. 
 a few days after my return to the east coast i received a very emotional call from my sister. she explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""have you seen this man"" flier on the door. it was a grainy surveillance photo of dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. the flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. when she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. now dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and i told i am not invited for christmas. poor dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

"by explaining my synesthesia to my boyfriend. i have grapheme-color synesthesia. basically i see letters and numbers in colors. the letter 'e' being green for example. a couple months ago i was explaining it to my boyfriend who's a bit of a skeptic. he asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. since then he'll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what i said a few months ago. always being the sameish as course. he still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe i just memeroized them really really well.

tonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. i tried explaining to him i just see the colors automatically when i visualize the letters in my head. i asked him what colour are the letters in his head. he looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in ""my head, that's not a thing"" 

my boyfriend didnt understand what i meant by visualizing the letters. he didn't believe me that i can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. 

turns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. when he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. he can't picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. he thought it was just an expression to say ""picture this"" or etc... its crazy to him the fact that i can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.

now i have a boyfriend that is really upset. he feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. he's been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing i wasnt pulling his chain. hes pretty upset and i feel really bad. 

tldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (cant visualize anything at all)

edit; oh wow this blew up. i just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn't being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. he never thought i was lying. i think it's one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it's way harder when you have aphantasia.",4

"update, for despising my mentally handicap sister?. i'm back like i said i would be,. my original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.

well, since that day i made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. the week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.

i started by telling my grandpa the story of why i broke down the way i did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. no one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. my grandpa told me some things that i don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is ""supposed"" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this i was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. with everything else i told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. he pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when i sat down with them. it didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. this included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a ""caretaker"" that doesn't exist.

suffice to say, this week has been rough. but, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. my grandfather spent this last week ""making up for the time i've lost."" encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things i want to do. my aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.

well, saturday night i sat down with parents to talk. it went badly to say the least. they came clean to me about everything. they told me things i will not repeat here. but they did not apologize. my parents still claim that i some how owed my sister my time. my father even saying ""you were put here to be her caretaker"". i won't lie and say i was composed. after everything i learned i confronted them. on the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. the money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. they denied it or made excuses. and in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.

today will be my last time talking to them for a while. after talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, i'm not going back. later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. when i graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. my aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. my parents have called me twice since saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when i was coming home.

i won't be going back to them. right now i still feel pretty uneasy about everything but i feel like that will pass. the rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. but in the end i lost my parents. over all of this, i've learned something that i wished i saw earlier. i don't hat my sister. in fact i love her with all my heart. i should never have never projected my hate onto her. that was wrong, and someday i hope to make up for it. but for now i need to leave.

so, there's my update. thanks again for the support my original post got. i really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. thanks you.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

edit: thank you all so much! i wish i could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. i'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. i want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.

&#x200b;

late edit: wow, i never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. i know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. 

&#x200b;

we just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. every thing i wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. i have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record i could think of. my parents were quiet the whole time i was there. shorty after i arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. it took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. i hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. even now i sit here and think if she really meant it. after this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. i hope she meant it. right now though, i think i just need to look ahead. maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. i hope so.

&#x200b;

thank you all for the advice and love. it's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience i at least got some positive out of this mess. will i come back? i don't know. if something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. but for now i'm going to move on. for all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and i hope to see you on the other side. see you space cowboy's :)",3
"for getting upset that my sister's fiance pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?. the title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

i'm 24 and i'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

i used and used until i was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

she's my best friend and i know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

she also met her fiance two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. he's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much i put my sister through. 

despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because i am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

when i get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

when i walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure i ""didn't bring anything in"".  i instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't i, and i tell him not to touch me. 

he tells me to ""calm down"" and that if i want to be here then he needs to do this. i tell him he's being ridiculous and i try to push past him. he stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" i told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

at this point i'm getting more and more angry and i'm practically yelling in his face at this point. bystanders came between us and separated us and told my bil to just ""drop it."" he said he would but that ""they can deal with it when i get out of hand.""

i just went to go find a seat after that. 

after the reception, a lot of my family told me that i should've let him just do it and that i was acting like a huge asshole and like i had ""something to hide."" 

i don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and i don't think my reaction was over the top. if anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. my sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"for refusing to stop cooking bacon in my kitchen due to my teenage daughters vegan lifestyle?. dad here, old fart, loves his daughter to pieces but i'm struggling to see eye to eye with my teenager and wife on this one. 

we've always been a meat eating family, we live in the rural midwest and bacon for breakfast is pretty much a given. this year my 14 y/o daughter decided to go vegan, and i jumped onto her support team with enthusiasm. we learned how to substitute ingredients, cook new things, try new things, i adjusted our budget to include more expensive vegan substitutes for her, etc. 

none of this has been a problem for me until recently. she saw me cook bacon in a pan, and then i rinsed it out to load in the dishwasher. she exploded in anger (teen years, i'm not too fussed about the anger explosion, i know she doesn't mean it) and said that that was her pan for vegan food. i was completely floored and said, kiddo this here is a family pan, older than you, it's not your pan. 

she asked me to purchase her a pan that she can solely use for vegan food. i didn't want her to feel weird about food, so i said sure, and ordered her a few colored ones that are only for her. the reason they're colored is so it helps me remember that i'm not to touch them unless i'm cooking vegan. 

that wasn't good enough. now apparently the dishwasher is 'contaminated' with animal product, and the fridge has 'bacon grease fingers' on it (because i eat bacon and then touch the fridge) and she's asked me and her mom to completely stop eating meat at home. i don't mean i literally touch the fridge with greasy bacon hands, because i wash my hands, but it's clearly enough that it upsets my daughter. 

frankly i'm on team hell no, her mom is much more amenable and strongly wants me to consider taking our daughter up on the request. my wife's reasoning is that both our parents live close so we can eat meat products there, and that she doesn't want our daughter to feel uncomfortable in the kitchen. my daughter says she is fine with cheese and butter in the fridge, but it's specifically meat products that make her feel sick. now i'm sorry for her, but i feel like she just needs to adapt and live side by side, because i'm not going to stop eating bacon in my own house.",3

"for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed?. me (28m) and fiancee (27f) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. i also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

on saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. i stayed with my parents but i left the dog with her because she likes having him there. however, *i made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on sunday i get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. she was drunk, so i told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. when i got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. i felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

but then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. the girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

when we got home, i told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. i told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and i'll tell mine. she was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, i get bombarded by messages on messenger, whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that i am insane to do this to her after 4 years. they started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

the logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. nope. they all fucking agree. my mom said: ""well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" lucky me, eh? my dog didn't fucking die!

my sister was appalled that i cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said i might have overreacted. yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. but i am so disgusted at my fiancee that i can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. she isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

by the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. she likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar dangerous things. it's not something i hold against her in the sense that i would ever mention in a fight, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. for example, my dog.

i'm 99% sure i will stand by my decision. but am i really an asshole? literally nobody is on my side and i have no idea what to think.

&#x200b;

**edit: posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. she is negligent and irresponsible and i don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. i'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. if she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, i would also leave her. i guess i realized i don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",3

"i (28m) with fiance (27f) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous ex was the best lover she ever had. it was quite by accident that i heard this.  we had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  some of us were in one room playing texas holdem and a couple of others were watching a lord of the ring marathon.  i thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  our group had run out of soda so i got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  as i'm rounding the corner i hear my fiance talking and before i completely come in the room i hear her clearly say ""jason is great but he will never be the lover that bill was"" she then followed it up with ""its not really fair to jason though, bill was just really gifted down there"".

at first i thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but i decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and i could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know i was there.  of course she has no idea i heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how i'm doing and if i'm having fun.  i was tempted to say something like ""i'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but i didn't.  i just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  i just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

needless to say it fucked me up.  i mean fucked me up bad.  i've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  i couldn't sleep that night and i went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  at first i was angry.  then i was humiliated.  then i was depressed.  then i was angry again.

look i realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  i would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

i tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on i just kept getting worse and worse.  i was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  that is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and i flat out rejected her.  it wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  i had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  but in the moment instead of being sexually aroused i felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

she asked me what was wrong and i just told her i must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

so much to my humiliation there i laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  i came clean and told her what i heard.

well this did not go over well at all.  at first she tried to tell me i did not hear her correctly.  but i just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  which once again i am sure was more of a big turn off for her because i was a wreck emotionally.

she tried to tell me how much of a better person i was and how i satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  but all i could hear was charlie browns teacher noise.

it's been almost a month and i have zero desire to be with her sexually.  none.  she is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what i have tried i just can not get past this.  it's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  she clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  well i know i can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  but no matter what i do i can't grow in size.  obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me i won't believe her.  she's most likely right.

some back story here.  he dumped her.  it was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  i know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  she said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  so this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  if he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  now i have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but i don't think she would.

i just don't know what to do here.  i can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  i know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that i think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told i am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  like what would happen if i lost my good paying job or better yet what if i were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  basically what i feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  i know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what i feel.

i'm sorry for the length here and i don't even know what i am asking here.  i am totally lost and if this continues i just think i am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and i need advice.

&#x200b;

edit:  holy god.  i made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  i have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  i don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  i am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  also thank you for the gold and silver kind internet strangers.

edit 2:  dear god.  i read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking i had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5k more posts.  i'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   i was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  i haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have i opened any of the 20 chat screens.  there are issues i want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  she was to use the barney gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  in other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  nope, neither of us drink.  we don't even have it in the house.
2. that i am upset she told her friend.  well this is an odd thing, before i posted this honestly i wasn't that upset about this part.  i was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  however now reading a lot of the post i have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  i would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. that i am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  well i'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  but the last part is just out of my control.  no matter what i do i will only ever be 7"" long.  we have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  she said that i was already great with everything but the one thing i can't control. (okay, so i gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. no i'm not going to do anything rash.  it's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  but yes i have to decide what i am going to do here before long.  it's not fair to either of us is i am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. she is sorry that i heard it.  she said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if i didn't catch her saying it.  it is what it is.  but yes i do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since i first told her.  me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  i don't know how much of that i believe but right now i guess i don't know why she would lie.  it really has wrecked hell on our christmas spirit this year i know that. 

edit 3:  engineer for those who keep asking what i do for a living.  she is a paralegal.  
edit 4:  people have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how i know she was heartbroken.  we met about 9 months after they separated.  i know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  he just ended things so he could be with another woman.  she approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  on our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  it was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but i did it.  we sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time i never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates i tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because i didn't want to commit either.  after close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  obviously that was our first night together.  within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  so yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  i had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

edit 5:  okay i posted it below in the mass of other posts but i have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

"college isn't the only way to start a good career. apprenticeships, trade schools, and military training can be great alternatives in today's world.. the price of four-year universities in the us, among other countries, is huge and growing. there are many situations where the degree is worth the cost, but not for everyone. obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer, a college degree is inevitable.

if, however, your desired path isn't so rigidly grounded in universities, or you just aren't sure what you'd like to do, take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges.

**to high school juniors and seniors:** 

your parents/guardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time, but things are different today. if you're going to broach this subject with them, get your sources ready ahead of time. here(https://www.thesimpledollar.com/why-you-should-consider-trade-school-instead-of-college/) is a good overview, but you should find other data, analyses, and opinions before fighting that battle.

**why are skilled trades more relevant now?**

these jobs have been around for a long time, but baby boomers have been over-represented for decades. as that generation retires, demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago. according to this article(http://www.careerprofiles.info/skilled-trade-worker-shortage.html), 53% of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45. anecdotally, i work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople, and almost all the hair here is grey. 

**is there any money in it?**

there definitely can be. unlike some college-bound fields, you won't likely be making six figures right out the gate, if ever. that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be worse off. assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes, you can be making money the day you start, and won't have any crippling debt to deal with. i'd recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter, but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18, even with less income, you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income, but couldn't contribute until _ years to complete degree + _ years to pay off debt later. 

that's assuming the college grad can get a job right away. there are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt. moreover, one can't get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy. you're stuck with any loans you take for school.

**what are my options?**

there are a ton of ways to start a career, but i'll talk about a few.

**apprenticeships** are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their hands-on knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them. apprentices will generally be paid very little at first, but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training. once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own, they will generally be making a nice, middle-class wage. 

a recent report(https://www.npr.org/2018/01/04/575114570/robust-apprenticeship-program-key-to-germanys-manufacturing-might) from npr took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in germany's industrial success. the us government is also pretty aware of the potential, even if they face challenges in funding programs. the federal program is here(https://www.dol.gov/apprenticeship/) and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest american job center(https://www.careeronestop.org/site/american-job-center.aspx)

the federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships. in a lot of cases, labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training. one example would be the ibew(http://www.electricianapprenticehq.com/how-to-join-ibew-apprenticeship/) for electricians, but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place, so i won't bother trying to list a bunch. searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities.

**trade schools** can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college, but much more focused and time/cost-efficient. many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associate's degrees. there are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade, like welding. job corps(https://www.jobcorps.gov/train) is a national program that can be a good option if a person isn't in a good position to pay for training. it isn't for everyone as i understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic, but i know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers. 

training doesn't have to be years long though, especially in the arena of computer sciences, ""boot camp"" programs are becoming very popular. a computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program, but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science, and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself.

**military** training can also be a great economic ladder. the pay and benefits are good from the start. depending on the specialty, the training can be really valuable (and free). plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans. there are some huge risks associated with this route though, so i would reserve it as a last resort. 

regarding benefits, the basic wage isn't a lot higher than minimum wage, which is often the subject of salty memes. that is not the only income, though. in most cases, living expenses are taken care of, so no need to budget for food, housing, or utilities. that's the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of, so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didn't have a cell phone or car. even then, if you are sensible, it would be easy to live below your means. another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family. on the outside, that would cost a lot.

regarding training, if you win the ""job lottery"" you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field. some people can walk away from four years of service making over $100,000/yr. you could also be a bus driver. you don't really get to choose, and that is the first big risk. i would say it is much better than a 50% chance that the job training you'd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma, but if you don't want to be a cop, and they make you a cop, that is a lot of wasted time.

regarding lifestyle, it can be a great time. i really enjoyed most of the time i spent in the military. there were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a six-year-long mistake. the good stuff is, you're part of a community, you might get travel a lot, you might have really exciting work to do. the bad stuff is, the culture can be very very toxic, you might have to be away from family for years, and being the military, there is an above average chance of being killed, injured, assaulted, or developing a mental illness.

i know that sounds dramatic, but a person shouldn't consider it lightly. in reality though, chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career.


**tl;dr**

if you want to get smart, go to college. if you want a good job, and don't want to become a slave to your own debt, consider a skilled trade.




**edit:** based on a lot of comments, it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others, and these things evolve over time. as a general rule, even if some branch guarantees you a specific job, proceed with caution. enlisting on an ""open"" contract is generally a terrible idea, but to clear up some confusion, the af lets you pick some jobs you want, and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes. ""no thanks"" is not an open aptitude, but if orders come down for you to enlist ""open general"", that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down. 

also about the military, i offered it up as a last resort, and i mean that. plenty of commentators are saying ""don't ever think about joining the military for training!"" i don't know their stories, but there is probably something to it; so many people can't be wrong. you would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility. if you aren't really interested in the military, it's not a great idea.

regarding rotc, it is better than nothing. i intentionally didn't mention it though. my philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing rotc vs my immediate family and i enlisting. if you do rotc, you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military. after 8 years, you walk away with at least a bachelors degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. if you enlist, in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associate's and bachelor's degree while you are in if you set your mind to it, especially in the af, can't say how easy it is in the others. so you walk away with a degree, the ability to check the veteran box, some work experience, and whatever money you saved up. from a benefits standpoint, you can save yourself some time by back-loading the school. additionally, i had a way better time than any officer i know, and i didn't even like the military. the lifestyles, politics, corruption, and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted. i wouldn't wish my understanding of the officer's life on anyone.

still relevant to rotc, but about school in general... a ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education. i'm not out to say they are wrong, but ""go to college if you want a good life!"" is neither a compelling nor useful lpt. you have surely gotten that line from someone else already.",8

i went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.

i'm not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this reddit gold to the comments that i feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.

"update: hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (to, canada). link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

first i want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and i are quite happy with. i've been very active on reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. it has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. i digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

through the advice i received on this subreddit, i contacted the city and the health department right away. i was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. the more we spoke the more interested he became. he called and asked me ""if i were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would i be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" to which i replied ""150%"". he then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, i said ""no."" 

shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. i went out and asked them why. they told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. i told them they were to leave it there as i have called the city and they are on their way. they didn't seem happy. as if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. i also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. i have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. this lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

i explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. according to toronto health and bylaws that is bullshit. the situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. the bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information i have been receiving from the building management. 

the bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. i heard nothing until monday. come monday morning i get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. they will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. the cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. i'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

the city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. i do not believe them at all. we have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. from what i understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. i have the personal contact information for the officer i spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. we went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

thank you so much reddit!!! i couldn't have done it without your help!! 

here is hoping the next few months continues on a more upward trajectory. ",2
"i ended a girl's gymnastics career when i karate kicked a door open and broke her toe. we were at a gymnastics camp when we were teenagers and there was a swinging door that i had wanted to bust open with a sweet karate kick all week long. the only thing stopping me was that i was afraid there was going to be someone on the other side and i didn't want to hurt anyone. well the last day comes around and i said fuck it, and kicked that door as hard as i could. my friend and teammate was on the other side and the door caught on her big toe, pulling it back and breaking it so badly she couldn't compete for almost a year, missed regionals, and ended up quitting. she just assumed i had pushed the door open like a normal person but nope. i karate kicked that bitch. i still feel bad about it and it was about 15 years ago. sorry girl.",11
"for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?. this happened a couple weeks ago, but i'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

i travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. most recently, i was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. this wouldn't be a problem except that i had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket i paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way i had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (because i take this specific route and airline a lot, i knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since i just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

of course, when it came time to board, i get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. i politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before i got there, and would i do her the favor of just switching?

here's the thing: if circumstances were different, i would have! but i explained that i had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that i could sleep. i really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts right then and there. 

by this point the plane is filling up, i'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so i just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. the mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. the flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as i did) goes, ""this is an exit row. your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. there's not going to *be* another empty row. please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

so i sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and i figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, i push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. when we land, i'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""you look like you slept well, bitch.""

so, reddit. am i the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**edited to add:** okay, thanks reddit, i think most of you agree that i'm not the asshole here. but please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. the kids were just fine. they watched something on their ipad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",3

"by not going to the hospital when i knew something was wrong with me. as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...

sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.

i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i'm not a big fan of, and napping.

i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.

i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn't let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up!"" (dave chappelle voice)

the dr. came flying into the room and said, ""hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap!""

my life stopped. ""a stroke? i'm 29? how could i have had a stroke?"" i couldn't comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides) i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, ""couldn't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" she told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (wednesday). if you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i've had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!

the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

but wait...there's more!!!

6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which i did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv's had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn't see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

fast forward, to october 2, 2017.

my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in april) for help but i don't remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

i did a follow up with my pcp (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...

i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.

what this means for me now is i'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i'm a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i'm not happy about it, but i don't let it change my outlook on life.

i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i'm out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.

i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i'm begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don't be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health

"macy's new employees are encouraged to open a store credit card (26% apr) to obtain their employee discount. i recently picked up a part-time seasonal position at macy's for some extra holiday cash. i've been working in retail off and on over the past 15 years, and am familiar with the hiring and management practices at a lot of places, but it's been a few years since i've worked for a big retailer like macy's. i was very surprised and disappointed to learn that the 20% employee discount  is only available through a prepaid card (like a gift card i guess, not terrible but not great), or through their *actual store credit card*. they conveniently inform you of this halfway through your new hire paperwork, and even allow you to apply right then and there.

i've been through this type of application process before, but i've never seen something so brazenly unethical. these are often young adults or older people applying for these positions, filling out so many forms with so much corporate legalese that your head would spin, and they're being targeted with a (hard hit, thanks auto mod) hit to their credit for a card with a ridiculous interest rate. is this new in retail? seems like a disturbing trend if it is.

anyone have any thoughts on this? just wanted to get the word out.

edit: thanks for the replies, everyone. really enjoyed the discussion about credit cards, business practices, and obviously pf. the consensus seems to be that store credit cards are not any worse than other forms of lending, as long as they are managed responsibly. i respectfully disagree, in that it seems like they are often offered to a range of people (namely, new employees) that may not have the knowledge or experience to handle a line of credit, but i will agree that it's fair game to solicit employees. i just think it's kind of shady to imply that a store credit card is an ""easy"" solution for employees. employees should just get an effing discount, period. but we're all free to work and shop where we please, so feel free to support smaller/local businesses that don't subject their customers and employees to frivolous lending situations.",10

the night after i wrote my original post, i wrote my wife a short letter (thank you /u/witchy_woman420 for the idea) that went something like this:

""dear \wife's name\,

i love you more than you can imagine and the most i want in this world is for you to be happy. i understand that as a man i probably have no idea how intense the pain that you are feeling is. i'm doing my best to help you but the fact that you won't help yourself is taking a toll on our marriage. i honestly cannot continue living like this for much longer and our marriage is in jeopardy if you don't make an effort to get better. however, i want to get over this bump together and start working in the right direction together. i'm ready to talk whenever you are.

with all my love,

i put the letter on top of her laptop and went to bed. the next morning (march 16th), i woke up a bit earlier than usual to fix her a double helping of her favorite breakfast: blueberry pancakes, bacon, scrambled eggs, and fresh squeezed oj. when i walked into the bedroom with her food, i saw her reading my letter. when she saw me, she put the letter down, got out of bed, threw herself into my arms, and started crying. full on, niagara falls level crying. i hugged her tighter, told her ""i love you so, so, much"", and started crying too. i honestly don't know how long we stood there hugging each other and crying. it could've been 10 minutes, it could've been an hour, i didn't care. when she stopped crying, she promised me that she would go to therapy. reddit, you guys don't know how thrilled and proud i was when i heard those words. she then asked me if we could go on a trip to japan because in her words ""i really need to leave this fucking house for once and get some fresh air.""

i was so fucking proud of her when she took the initiative in planning our trip. she's always been a methodical, organized person and as she booked the flights and hotels i saw in her eyes the same spark that made me fall in love with her 8 years ago. we just finished packing for the trip and she fell asleep with the faintest of smiles on her face not too long ago. we have a 5am uber to catch, a trip to enjoy, and both therapy and dog-shopping sessions lined up when we return.

"update dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. am i wrong to be angry?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

you guys are right. i can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. i resent this man so much. i can't stand the sight of him. 

after i posted yesterday, i was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. to no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. i picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. i heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but i didn't bring up any of our hardships. my mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. i did, i forgave him but that doesn't mean i need to have a relationship with him anymore. again, my family protested that i'm being cruel and heartless. i'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. i told them i would not be present at any family events if he was there.

my sister shouted at me claiming ""he is our dad. you asshole"". yes he is, to which i replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. i told them i had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. my sisters need to return the iphone's that are on contract as i am cancelling those. driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that i pay for. these are dad's responsibilities now. ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

i have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. i need a break.

i'm done. i'm done taking over dad's role. i'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. i'm 25 and i need to live my own life now. i don't think this will burn bridges. it's just a wake up call for them.

edit: i'm not going to ghost or abandon them. they need to become independent now. 

edit:  i'm reading all the comments. i know i have acted like a jerk. i just need some time to collect my thoughts. i might update later.",7
"cop pulled me over and i called 911 and lied to get out of going to jail.. when i was 19 i was running late to work in my tiny pos economy car and on fumes of gas i didn't come to a complete stop on a right turn. lights behind me so i pull over. i know i've barely got any gas at all and was almost to a gas station, hence why i rolled through the stop a little. trying not to have the car die. 

at the time (around 1995) a new digital phone had come out called voicesteam (now tmoblie) and their whole big thing was the phones were digital and not cellular. they were the first phones with caller id and one of the big things the salesman had said over and over was since it was digital the signal couldn't be triangulated or traced. not that i cared but it stuck in my mind. 

well as i give the cop my license, registration and insurance card i got an idea. i knew if i was late to work i was going to lose my job. they were super strict there. 

so i get an idea and right after i hand the papers to the cop and he's walking back to his cruiser i called 911 and tell the operator i just saw a guy with what looked like a shot gun walk into a 7-11 that was about 2 blocks away. i confirmed the address then i hung up. 

about 30 seconds later the cops comes sprinting to my car and hands me all my stuff and rushed says, ""come to a complete stop next time!!"" then peels off to the direction of the store. 

pushed my car to the gas station that i'd almost made it to and felt pretty pleased with my ingenuity. 

i was an idiot and i confess!

edit: wow, this blew up.  i forgot to mention i would have gotten arrested, booked and released, because i was driving with a suspended license for unpaid traffic tickets and i had a bench warrant for it.  because i'm an idiot!

so it wouldn't have been just a few mins late to work. the job was a physical high turn over one that didn't tolerate much.

thank you to the kind souls giving me these medals/awards!  don't think i deserve them but i'll pass it along to those who do!",11
"final update: my gf was raped and became pregnant. i broke up with her when she wouldn't abort the baby.. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bkft0r/my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i_broke_up/

tldr: my gf was raped. wanted to abort. talked to mother. decided not to abort. i left her.

tldr: gf calls me, reveals mum made her not get an abortion because god cares. she wants me back and arranges for abortion she wanted all along. some of reddit think i'm a baby killer.

update 2: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/

tldr: mother tries to get me arrested for kidnapping or domestic abuse or some loony stuff.


i just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. this will be my final update.

a few days ago, the abortion was carried out. during the weeks beforehand, my gf went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. she was also tested for any stis (she's clear!).

she went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. a few days ago it was successfully carried out.

they went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. gf said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.

when she came home, she cried and cried and cried. she says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.

we took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). while in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.

she's amazing, man. seriously.


update on the mum! so my gf received a call from her mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.

my gf and i have an agreement that if mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. in this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.

i told the mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. i then said ""how jesus of you"" at which point she hung up.

my gf didn't find it funny...

anyway, that's it.


good luck to everyone in their lives.

she tells me she was drunk and it ""just happened"". 
i'm so hurt right now. she's said how sorry she is many times, and i believe her, but i feel so betrayed. 
we've had a great relationship up to this point, i've loved every minute of it. to add to it she tells me before that how she confided in him that she was scared of spending the rest of her life with someone and how she was unsure about our relationship. 
this hurts me to my core to think that someone i wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. out of all the women i've ever dated she was the one i was least worried about this happening with. 
she tells me that it was the biggest mistake she's ever made and how she regrets it, i just don't know if i can move on. 
we live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult. 
i just don't know what to do. i still love her to pieces  but idk if i can get past this. 
do i still go on the trip with her? do i try and make this work? i'm certainly holding off on the proposal for now.

"update: parents who hired people to kidnap me ended up sending me to a troubled teen camp. i'm back after 6 months.. you can read my old post here: florida: parents hired people to kidnap me. my brother ended up pointing a gun at them. what do i need to do to get emancipated?(https://old.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7478b8/florida_parents_hired_people_to_kidnap_me_my/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=legaladvice)

i sadly don't have any good news. just two weeks after posting that my parents ended up sending me to a camp. the camp that they sent me to was using the same property and facilities of an older camp which was closed down due to abuse of teenagers.

the place wasn't like anything i imagined it would be. i tried to cooperate and pretend everything is normal but they see compliance as a form of resistance. they also see non-compliance as a form of resistance. whatever you do they see it as resistance. their formula is that we were defective people and the only way to fix us is to first break us down completely and then rebuild according to their standards.

until they see you have mental breakdowns they don't agree that you're ready to relearn everything and change, so they continue the pressure. even when i was doing everything they wanted they weren't convinced. it took maybe 3 months for them to be convinced that i'm broken down and they did break my spirit to be honest. i got to the point that i didn't care about anything anymore, i just wanted it to end.

they knew about my youtube channel and they wanted me to login and delete all my videos and delete the channel. they had a girl who pretended to work in the kitchens to befriend me only to see if i truly hate my old self or not. she'd tell me that she watched my videos and she was insulting me left and right and was saying horrible things about me and my brother (also youtuber) and i was supposed to agree with her, if i took things personally they knew i was acting and wasn't ready.

they got me when i was at my lowest and they got me to log them into the account. the next day they brought me in front of a computer and showed me that my old password wasn't working anymore and told me that they've deleted my account. i was thinking all the time and effort i placed there was gone.

from there i didn't care anymore and they were convinced they've achieved their goal. so things became easier. they'd teach me to be a nice girly christian girl who wants to raise babies and would never touch a boy until she is married to someone her parents pick. it was like they were sending me into a children's book. then my dad came and brought me back home.

when i got back my brother actually told me that my youtube account wasn't deleted. since i was using his email for recovery he got a notification when i logged in from the camp because it was a new place. so he figured this isn't good news and jumped and changed the password. so my account is intact. the assholes at the camp were lying.

i don't know if i'm the same person or not or how much i've changed but i really hate my parents. i hate them so much that a year ago i couldn't even imagine such a level of hatred is possible. there are 448 days until i'm 18 and i'm counting every single day until this is over and then i'm leaving with my brother and we're never looking back.

my big brother is the only positive thing in my life and the only person who i trust. when i was gone he went to police, cps, even talked to a lawyer and a pi to find a way to get me back but nothing worked. my parents came after my $15,000 which i had at a joint account with my brother in order to pay for this program that they sent me to. but my brother actually ended up moving the money to an account only under his own name so parents couldn't access it. he continued to post the videos that i had prepared in the pipeline when i was gone so i continued to make more money and didn't lose subscribers.

that's it for me. from what i understand my parents couldn't afford to keep me there anymore that's why they pulled me out otherwise the place wanted more time with me. ",2
"girlfriend applied for a job, within 24 hours they hired her, and sent her a check for $4,000 to buy supplies. scam?. i dont know if this is the right place to post this.

my girlfriend applied to a job at a place called hci group. within one conversation online they hired her, and said they will send her a check for $4,000 to buy necessary equipment like software. 

this morning, she received an overnight check from patelco credit union for $4,415.

my dad used to tell me ""if it seems too good to be true, it is"". and this seems like one of those things. does anyone have any info on hci group, patelco credit union, company scams where they send you a cashiers and rush you? 

**edit** email she just received:

you're to deposit the check to your account and scan and email the atm deposit slip to me on ( redacted ) once done for confirmation, no need to send the slip to any other email address or email any worker that you got the package even if a note came with the check, have already contacted them they just want to make sure you get it, so you email the slip to my email address only, thanks
note: make sure it's an atm deposit because atm is 24 hours service and funds availability, you need to order the equipment tomorrow once the full funds are available so that you can receive the equipment by next tomorrow and get started.

you only need to take your atm card with the check to your bank's atm machine then deposit it into your bank account okay ? you will see the option when you get to the atm

**edit 2** just talked to patelco. a check for $4,415 was never issued from their company. sending patelco a picture of the check since they said its a fraud, and then shredding that son of a b. i've read all your comments by the way! we're just figuring out how to respond to a very needy spammer.

**edit 3** scammers are angry at our non-responsiveness. they threatened us by saying ""you better cash in that check or their agents will find you"". i promptly told them to fuck off and blocked them. patelco was very happy we called them, since now they know their company is being used for scams.

**edit 4** just wanted to do another quick edit. my girlfriend received this job offer from her schools job network. she goes to a small, expensive private college and she got hit with this fraud through a secure network that needs to be approved by the school first. always be on the lookout for scam. 

**edit 5** we did not shred the check. we decided against it and are going to report it. 

**edit 6** blowing up much further than i expected this too. /u/iac74205 said i could report it to the postal inspectors if it came by usps. it came by fedex, is there a postal inspector for that?

**edit 7** we've contacted the school once to report the scam! my girlfriend is taking a shower and right afterwards shes a: reporting it to the fbi and b: demanding that the school sends out an email blast to all of the students going there. 

**edit 8** i said it in a comment below, but i just wanted to thank all of you for all of your advice. i've read every comment and we have a ton on our plate to take care of. the users of /r/personalfinance rock!

**edit 9** reported it to the school, this was their message: 

hi girlfriend,

thank you for sending over this information.  we have flagged this employer in handshake as fraudulent and have removed them as an approved employer as well.  i know that redacted, our office manager, has already created a warning in the system for them, and i will do the same with the information you have sent to me.  i will also discuss with our directors about any further steps that need to be taken.

thank you so much for reporting this!  please let me know if you have any other concerns.

**edit 10** using edits to answer faq's now. she did not give any information besides what would be on a resume. work history, name, etc. she did not give bank account details or her ss number.

**edit 11** just in case someone wanted to see what the fake check and the letter she was send looks like, here you go(http://imgur.com/a/lfw0m)

**edit 12** i just wanted to confirm this, both patelco and hci are legitimet companies. we called patelco and they have their fraud working on it. we didn't call hci but i've had enough messages saying they've worked from hci i believe its legit. i think this guy was just using the names to sound legit.

**edit 13** ladies and gentlemen, i need to give a shout out to /u/dotonfire /u/kell_naranek and /u/meanreds . they pointed out that the signature is thomas jeffersons. the dead are rising, and they're scamming /s

**gilded edit 14** i was just given gold. as much as i appreciate someone thinking a thread for asking advice is good enough to pay real money too, its unneccessary! if you are really feeling charitable, consider giving to a charity. personally, i suggest doctors without borders(https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm?source=add1600u0v53&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;utm_expid=7773760-9.t4pemk1ytfeoymrjr_ytiq.0&amp;utm_referrer=https%3a%2f%2fwww.google.com%2f) or pacer(https://pacer.ejoinme.org/mypages/donatetothenationalbullyingpreventioncenter/tabid/229451/default.aspx) . use it for something more important than bragging rights.

"free tax filing software program offered to anyone making <$64k.. with tax season fast approaching i wanted to make everyone aware of a little-known fact that if you make less than $64,000 a year you are eligible for free tax filing and preparation(https://www.irs.gov/filing/free-file-do-your-federal-taxes-for-free). 

the government has a contract with tax prep companies like h&r block that allows for free tax filing for 70% of americans. you can use the tax prep software that companies normally charge for without paying a penny if you go through the irs's website. the program opens in january to file your 2017 tax returns.

the irs's advertising budget for this program is $0 so very few people realize it exists. last year only 2% of eligible taxpayers used this system. most people paid the companies to prepare their taxes because they weren't aware of this great program. it is literally the same programs the companies charge for being offered for free. 

*if you're interested in why companies would offer their products for free it's because it prevents the government from offering a free filing option. so long as tax companies offer free filing to 70% of us taxpayers the government will not offer a competing tax prep option, per the contract. they just work very hard to make sure no one actually knows the free filing option exists so we continue to pay them to prepare our taxes.*

"by submitting hardcore furry erotica instead of my final paper.. so, i'm currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. one of the classes i was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. while the class didn't require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. for our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. i did my paper on helium-3 power generation. i worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. the papers were due last night at midnight and i held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. this is where i fucked up big time.

let me tell you a little about myself. i don't work a normal job. i tried it in my first year of school and i really didn't like it. i've worked internships when they came up but outside of that i really didn't ""work"". this and being a student really doesn't mix well though. so, i had to make money some way. for the past 3 years i've gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. specifically, for furries. i would write anything. any fetish, any premise, anything. in some parts of that community i became really popular. at one point i was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts i charged  to my customers. am i proud of this? no. i have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. i told myself the minute i got a ""real"" job i was cutting and running from this work.

well, this brings us to last night. i had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. i had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. i was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. i was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. i ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. however, instead of submitting my final paper, i somehow submitted one of the commissions i was working on. this commission is not light either. it is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.

so, i went to bed. submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. when i woke up this morning i checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.

i want to fucking die right now. i don't know how i'm going to explain why instead of my final i submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. but yeah, i fucked up big time.

tl:dr: in my final semester at college. instead of submitting my final research paper, i submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. professor ""want's to talk"" and i want to die.

&#x200b;

obligatory update:

well, i just left his office and i still want to die. not as much though. i took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  i won't lie, when i sat down with him i was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. i guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.

i ran down pretty much everything i said here. while he didn't agree with the avenue i was taking to make money he understood why i was doing it.

he had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission's name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of ""customer\_commission\_2nd draft.doc""). i've taken a class from him before and was an a student so he guessed i had submitted the wrong file on accident. he told me he read the first page and ""realized it probably wasn't meant for him to read"".

i gave him the copy i brought and he accepted it. he told me to email him the file and he would replace the one i had submitted and that we would ""pretend this never happened."" he seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what i had originally submitted was ""well written at least"" from what he read.

like i said. i still want to fucking die right now. at least he understood that i'm just an idiot and not malicious . thanks i guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown.",4
"update: i (21m) got my fwb (33f) pregnant and she's keeping it, i want to talk to her about other options.. this is the original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bhfi57/_/

well some time has passed.. and a lot has happened. my first post had a lot of comments and i got some pm's from people asking me what went down so that's why i'm updating.

so i didn't end up talking about abortion or anything like that because i realized it was pointless and rather insensitive. i didn't talk to her for 3 days, which she got a little upset about and i shouldn't have done that. but i needed some time to figure things out and think, because whatever i was going to decide would change my life so i needed some space, though i could have communicated a bit more (which i'm working on now).

anyways, i realized that i'm just straight up ridiculously in love with her and have been for a while. i was stuck on the age gap, i kinda blocked the word relationship in my mind when i thought of her. some comments really stuck with me and i decided to just trust my feelings. i ended up confessing my love for her when we finally met up and well lots of (happy) tears were shed. she was too scared to talk about her feelings because she knew how i felt about the age gap and she didn't want to make me uncomfortable or possibly mess up what we had. i'm very glad to say that she feels the same way. she completely lit up when i told her, i saw the joy and happiness in her eyes. she was ecstatic, i won't ever forget that. 

every minute we've spent with each other since has been amazing. i really do love this woman, there's just no way around it. we talked so much with each other the past couple of weeks and i don't understand how it has all been so amazing. i know we're probably still sort of in a honeymoon phase right now, but damn if she isn't the one.. i moved in with her almost 2 weeks ago, i had to do some adjusting at first but we worked through it. she has met my parents, that went surprisingly well actually. they got along really well, and they both told me that they could see why we were together and that we are a great fit. on top of that they both told me in private how much they like her, that has never happened with any girl i've introduced them to. the pregnancy came as a big shock however, and they needed some time to process it because well, they're going to be grandparents. i'm an only child so it's a pretty big deal, i'm really close with my parents. they are handling it right now, they asked a lot of questions and we answered them together. they fully support us now which does mean a lot to me.

she's in the last week of the first trimester now, and she's doing really well so far. i've been trying to help her and support her any way i can, and did a ton of reading online to understand what's going on. i offered to pause school for one year, but she insists we can make it work and that i can keep going. we need to work out the details but we got some time left for that.

so yeah... i'm going to a dad. she's gonna give birth to our kid.. still feels surreal to me, but i'm low-key kinda excited. it'll probably be very exhausting and hard at first but that's life. i'm happy that i'm doing this together with her. 

(any tips on how to support her during her pregnancy are welcome btw..)

"restaurant made a mistake and charged me $228 on a $19 bill. it's a reminder to monitor your accounts and keep your receipts.. i went out to dinner on saturday night. after splitting the check with my girlfriend, the bill came to $19. used one of my credit cards, left a tip, kept my receipt and walked out. that charge had been pending until today where it posted as a $228 charge. it would have been easy enough to slip buy if i didn't check my accounts often, but i knew something was wrong right away.

called the restaurant, explained the situation, gave them the order number and table number, sent them a photo of my receipt and it's being corrected. so this is a friendly reminder to monitor your accounts and keep your receipts often!",10

"saying: ""i don't want to save, i want to live life and have fun while i'm young"" is just an excuse that makes you feel better about your bad spending habits.. i see this over and over in my family and friends and ironically in r/personalfinance. "" i want to live my life, not save every penny"", that sort of thing. 

**it is possible to save while still doings fun things, eating nice meals and traveling.** when someone makes it a this-or-that situation i think they are making excuses for poor spending habits or budgeting. sometimes deferring gratification leads to the ability to have more fun and freedom once you've established yourself financially. i'm not talking about waiting till retirement btw, im talking about getting a budget setup, getting some investments going, getting some interest coming in, paying off debt that costs you interest etc. interest is money you could be using for fun, that you instead are paying to some huge corporation. what i'm describing isn't some kind of punishment, it's a way to be more intentional and to always make sure the things you are spending on are helping you attain your goals and add lasting fulfillment to your life. it's the ability to buy things at their actual cost because you can get a decent interest rate. 

i don't make insane amounts of money, but i'm careful and try not to buy things i don't need. i always ask how many times a year i will use something before buying it. i think about how small amounts add up to be a big amount over time. my family mocks me saying things like "" he still has his first $1."" basically saying i'm cheap. they all buy whatever they want when they want it. they are in debt, stuck in life and unfulfilled by the very items keeping them there. once you get on the roller coaster of spending on credit cards for instant gratification, it can be very hard to get off.

i'm not saying this in a judgemental way, i've just seen so many people i care about struggle financially because of this mindset. i've seen it limit their ability to see the world and follow their dreams. seeing it being perpetuated in a place designed to help people get their shit together is kind of brutal to watch. 

if you are a young person coming here for advice, this is the best advice i can give: briefly defer your gratification. half the time the thing you ""must have"" seems pointless if you just sit on it for a week. avoid impulses and focus on experiences and items that will last and wear well over time. once you have established a solid financial foundation, your ability to go places and do things will quickly outpace the friends and family around you that are focused on attaining every minor impulse and paying off the associated debts.



**tl:dr you can be financially together and still have a fun!**

"mn a girl is planning to claim i am the father of her baby when we never had sex. i've been living in a foster home since january '18. i turn 15 in march. the foster parent if you want to call her that is a woman with a weight and alcohol problem who loves to yell. she blames me for getting her daughter pregnant who is 22 and lives here. i never had sex with her, and i would choose death if it were a choice between that and having sex with her. unless she somehow raped me without me remembering it, it's not mine, but she's going to put me down as the father anyway. the foster ""parent"" claims teenage boys can't control their hormones so it must have been me.

i can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. i said i would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks i will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample. she is trying to gaslight me into believing something that never happened, probably because the real father is a real loser like her.",2
"if tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.. tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. i can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. i have friends who have been fat fished. that's essentially the same damn thing. why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. it's so fucking dumb to me. a girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""you go girl!"", ""girl power!"", blah blah blah. a guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""asshole!"", ""so misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. it annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are. 

&#x200b;

let me be clear, **i have no issue with a woman if she is fat. i am just not attracted to it. also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because i'm 5'9""** 

&#x200b;

yes i'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to bumble, and it's not as bad as something like hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. while this is about tinder's new settings, i think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

"update my 42m daughter 14f won't get an abortion. yesterday i posted https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/ds59s0/my\_42m\_daughter\_14f\_wont\_get\_an\_abortion/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ds59s0/my_42m_daughter_14f_wont_get_an_abortion/) but it got removed because i didn't have ""throwra"". i've added it and messaged the mods to confirm it's me. because the original was deleted, you can read it here:

**original** 

i \42m\ am a single father to my daughter \14f\. my wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. she's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. she doesn't see too much of me because i work 9-7, but i'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

around tuesday, i noticed there was something off about her. she was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch tv together. i figured it was just moody teenage hormones. except it doesn't stop. friday i finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. she looked at me and just burst into tears. she cried more, so i held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""i'm pregnant.""

i was shocked. utterly and completely shocked. i kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. i took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. i didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, i'd wait until she calmed down a little. saturday she came down for breakfast and i sat her down and asked her her plans. she said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. i then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. i calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? i go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. she suggested she start online school, which i refused, saying i don't want her to ruin her life.

the thing is, i don't even want to consider adoption. i can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. i don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if i lose her?i told her this, and she asked me if i had no love for my grandchild. but i don't. i don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, i care about her. the girl i raised. i told her today that she had to abort her child. she cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. there's no way i'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. and for school, i don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

at this point, i see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, i'm kicking her out. it hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, i'm afraid her life will truly be over. i won't actually, but i'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. i'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do i get out of this?

where do i go from here?

tl;dr: my daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**update**

so today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. it's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. they said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

after the doctor's i took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. i told her i had to know, she had to tell me. she refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. we went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so i took it and looked through her messages. according to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. she hadn't told him yet.   
i wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him i was \daughter's name\ dad, and i needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. i expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so i called his mom and i told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. she asked if i was sure, and i said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. i said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. she said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. i asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. she asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. she hung up before i could say anything else. 

now i don't know where i stand. i can't afford a lawyer, and i don't think i can make him get involved either way. i don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. is there a way they could get out of paying it? i don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

my daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but i'm going to stop peppering her with it now. my sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and i hope a female influence will work better on her than i am. she's sending a little bit of money, and i think i may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and i can do.

"i used to work in a shoe shop and deliberately sold a customers shoes whilst she was trying on shoes, just to make her buy a new pair.. title says it all. i was 16 and my first job was in a shoe shop. we had one regular awkward woman customer who came in every saturday afternoon whilst the store was at its busiest and literally asked to try on every pair of shoes in the shop before leaving an hour later without buying anything. i was the new boy and the youngest, so all the other staff always dumped her on me. one day, she was up to her usual saturday afternoon hobby and an elderly lady, obviously visually impaired handed me a pair of shoes and asked me how much...  they were the awkward customers own shoes that the elderly woman had picked from the floor. i quoted her a ridiculously low price and she bought them immediately. ten minutes later, the awkward customer started shrieking that she couldn't find her shoes and after complaining to the manager believing they had been stolen by shoplifters. he was having none of it stating it wasn't the companies fault if customers had their personal property stolen in the store. the woman had to buy a new pair of shoes or leave bare footed. we never saw her again.


edit: thankyou for all the replies. i would never have believed this posting would generate so much interest as i posted this story over a year ago as a reply on askreddit and only received 3 replies, lol.

to elaborate on the story and answer some of the questions raised; firstly, yes, it is a true story and happened some time over the school summer holiday period of 1984 shortly after i started working at the store. the department i worked in wasn't exactly the normal shoe shop environment most people are familiar with. i worked in a special department on the lower ground floor of one of the larger branches of a national shoe retailer and this department sold all the reject stock from all the other branches. stuff such as shop soiled, sun faded stock from window displays, repaired damaged stock, customer returns etc. the stuff that was below the standard that could be sold in the regular departments. all stock we held was displayed on the shop floor on racks so you couldn't ask for different sizes etc as it was all random stuff. we only displayed the right foot of a pair of shoes and customers had to ask for the left foot of the shoe to try on, and there was a rule that only one pair could be given to one customer to try on for security reasons. we had a major problem with shoplifting and there were only normally two or maximum three members if staff manning the department. it was a hell of a job keeping track of the pairs that were handed to customers to try when the shop floor was busy, and often shoplifters waited till we were all distracted then left without paying. this was before cctv so all we had were our eyes to monitor where paired stock was on the shop floor... the woman i describe as awkward, wasn't just awkward in the traditional sense, she was totally obnoxious, narcissistic, racist and constantly demanding attention. her behaviour lost us a lot of stock to shoplifters because she distracted us from watching other paired stock out on the shop floor and she wouldn't return pairs she didn't want, just kicked them off in a corner before wandering around looking for the next pair. a couple of weeks before the story, a pair of shoes she had asked to try were stolen because of her doing this and her attitude when we asked her, was that it wasn't her problem and we deserved to lose stock because we were all jews (sorry if this is offensive to you but that's what she said)... back to the original story, lol, the incident wasn't premeditated, it was one of those spontaneous  'fuck you' opportunities where all rationality temporarily disappears for a moment. the elderly lady handed me the bitch woman's shoes and that was it, lol. i only asked the elderly lady for either 50p or £1, i can't remember what, bagged them and the sale went through the till followed by a thankyou... incidentally, the condition of the bitch woman's shoes and quality of brand was a lot better than the crap we sold, so the old  dear got one hell of a bargain... my thoughts immediately afterwards weren't of satisfaction, they were of 'oh shit', and i was bricking it, worrying what would happen next, lol. when the shit hit the fan and the manager became involved, i was just glad he was pre-aware of her and had no sympathy of her loss because of her attitude when she previously lost our stock.

once again, thankyou for all replies and unexpected flow of upvotes.",11
"by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door. throwaway account because obviously.

my boyfriend and i are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. we got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. we're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. i started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so i figured on going to completion. unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

so there i am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. his mom comes in! i freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

anyways, it's 5:40am, i've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

tl;dr: bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

update @7:31am - thanks for all the reassuring comments. my bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. more to come.

update @8:38am - of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... anyways thanks! so breakfast started off totally fine. i mean, yeah i was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. that is, until i excused myself to go shower. she stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. but then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". it was sweet and cringy all at once. i guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

update: a lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. actually i assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); i didn't actually see her do it. i asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while i was...ehm...cleaning.",4
"don't sell the stocks in your retirement portfolio because of the drop in the market!. i've seen a few questions asking if investors should sell their stocks and move them into treasury bonds or a money market account. the answer is no.

"be prepared if you're resigning or quitting, have been fired, or are being laid off: a pf checklist. there's a long list of things you need to worry about when separating from your job regardless of how or why that is happening.  it is often an emotional time, but missing a few key steps could be troublesome down the road. (https://www.someecards.com/usercards/viewcard/leaving-my-job-without-the-going-away-party--aa5a7/)

this checklist is intended to apply for most situations including: resigning or quitting a job, being fired from a job, or being laid off.  navigating the end of a contract as a contractor is not really the focus of this post, but some steps may still apply.

some specifics will only apply to the us (e.g., retirement account types, filing for unemployment, health care).  if you're aware of a guide for any other countries, please make a comment!

## before resigning *or* if you are at risk of being let go/laid off

- it hopefully goes without saying, but you should already have a firm job offer in hand before resigning (unless you have a different plan like heading back to school).  likewise, if you are at risk of being let go or laid off, you should be building your network at the very least (if not outright looking for a new position).
- do you have a retirement plan with your employer (e.g., 401(k), 403(b), 457, simple ira, sep ira, or tsp)?
  - note that many employers will require to to pay off any outstanding loans you have made against your retirement plan.  if that's the case, you will have only 60 days after separation to pay off the balance to avoid early distribution taxes and penalties.
  - plan out what you'll do with your 401(k) or other employer-sponsored retirement account.(https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/retirementaccounts/rollovers)
  - recognize that you will be giving up any unvested matching for your retirement plan.
- have a plan for the first few months after the job.
  - figure out what you'll do for health insurance (sign up for your own via cobra or the aca, switch to a spouse's plan, or wait to get coverage with new employer).
  - consider whether you will want to convert your group life insurance policy to an individual policy.
  - make sure you have enough money to carry you into your next job without dipping into your emergency fund, set up a budget, and examine your general financial situation.  emergency funds are for unexpected circumstances.
  - if you are planning on moving, understand that landlords often want to see proof of a job and income - which may make getting a new place more difficult.
- make copies of any performance reviews, professional certifications, or other personal documents that you'll want to keep as well as your current vacation balance, salary information, etc. having a copy of your contract and benefit information on a personal computer is also recommended as you might not have access to them in the future.
- however, do not take copies of any work performed without written approval from management.  this is not your property and is equivalent to stealing.
- backup (commonly by emailing a copy to your personal email or copying to a thumb drive) and remove all personal files from your work computer, work phone, and any other device.
- be prepared for what you'll do or say if your manager makes a counteroffer.  many people say it's a bad idea to stay after attempting to resign, but it can also go well.
- don't give more than two weeks of notice if leaving immediately and not being paid for your remaining time would be a financial hardship.
- if you received stock options, received a hiring bonus, or receive ongoing monetary bonuses or rsus:
  - examine your vesting schedule and consider whether you may have to return any bonus money (e.g. hiring bonus, moving stipend, education assistance) before you decide when to quit.
  - don't expect to collect options, rsus, or bonuses during your notice period because you might be terminated immediately. it's better to wait to give notice until after any important vesting dates (you should still give two weeks).
  - purchase any stock options that are ""in the money"".
- check on your benefits and find out what happens to them upon leaving.
  - do you get your outstanding vacation days paid out or do you lose them (meaning you should take them before resigning if possible)?
  - when does your health/dental/vision insurance expire?  end of the month or day you leave?  make sure any appointments are scheduled with this in mind.
  - if you have floating holidays, you may want to take them before resigning.
  - if you have an fsa, is there anything left in it to spend down (check out fsa eligible items on amazon). anything left the day you leave, the company keeps. even if you are resigning on jan 15 and only contributed once, you can still spend the entire annual amount and not have to pay it back.

- put together an email list of anyone you want to email (individually or as a group) when you leave.  don't email too large of a group because it's tacky and use bcc: for group emails.
  - email should be short and to the point. something like it was great working with you, i learned a lot.  here's my personal info to keep in touch.  don't try to explain yourself.

## how to resign

- don't burn any bridges and maintain a professional attitude. you never know who you will run into again in the future, keep it professional.
- bring a box with you (leave it in your car if you can't bring it in discreetly) to allow for easy packing of any personal possessions in case you are walked out that day.
- make sure you have contact information for any key people - coworkers, managers - that you want to keep in contact with or possible use as a reference in the future.  send a copy of this to your personal email.
- do not tell your coworkers/friends prior to telling your boss and hr.  this is not something that you want floating around the office.
- tell your manager in person and present a short and professional resignation letter to him or her at this meeting.  when you leave the meeting, email a copy to them and hr (even if it is from home later that day).
  - don't make it personal or give a reason.  state the facts.  ""i am resigning position effective date."" you don't owe them a reason (especially in written form), don't try to provide a list of things they could fix, etc.
  - if you want to elaborate with your manager in person, keep the discussion positive and brief.
- give two weeks notice and finish strong, but don't be surprised if you get walked out the day you resign or even immediately after resigning.
- if you do end up working the notice period - you still need to work!  this is what you will be remembered for, don't start slacking off. work with your manager to finish or hand off all projects you are currently working.
- once you do leave, if something was left behind, make arrangements to pick it up. talk to hr about this if needed.
- send any goodbye email later from a personal email account.  don't ""spam"" aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people (under 20 people).

## what to do after you are laid off or fired

- don't burn any bridges and maintain a professional attitude. you never know who you will run into again in the future, keep it professional.
- try to keep a calm appearance until you are off property.  this is an emotional time, but you don't want to be remembered as the person who cussed out everyone as they were dragged out by security.
- make sure you have contact information for both your manager and hr representative in case of questions later.
- try your best to pack any essential personal possessions that day if you get walked out, check for small things like cell phone chargers and pictures. it can be awkward returning later.
  - if you do need to return for personal items or any other reason, make arrangements in advance, don't just show up and expect to be let back in.
- you may be asked to sign a legal document giving up certain rights (e.g., a non-compete clause or waiving certain rights to sue) in exchange for severance pay and/or other benefits.  note that non-compete clauses are very difficult to enforce in some states.  you absolutely need to read the entire document before signing and it's your decision to make.  consult an attorney if you need help.
- send any goodbye emails later from a personal email account.  don't ""spam"" aliases for an entire company or large departments unless it is a very small number of people (under 20 people). do not send anything right away because your emotions will be running high.

## after leaving

- if you were laid off or fired, apply for unemployment(https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-file-for-unemployment-benefits-online-2064123) as soon as you can assuming you were not fired for misconduct (i.e., terminated for cause)(https://www.thebalance.com/can-i-collect-unemployment-if-i-am-fired-2064150). the entire process can take weeks so do this as soon as possible.
- any life insurance coverage through your employer will terminate after you leave (sometimes immediately, sometimes at the end of the month).  consider converting your group life insurance policy to an individual policy, especially if others depend on your income or if you have medical conditions that may prevent you from getting an individual policy on your own. the cost tends to be low, but you will only have a limited amount of time to do this (usually 30 days or until the end of the current month, but don't count on that).
- move your 401(k) or other employee-sponsored retirement account to your new plan or a rollover ira (if that was your plan).
- get on linkedin and link up with the ex-coworkers who would say good things about you (and vice versa).
- get health insurance if needed (see above).  there's a 60-day grace period after leaving your job for cobra election (you can get coverage retroactively), but signing up for aca coverage may be less expensive.
- make sure you have a plan for how you will sell any company stock.
- inform your new employer about how much you've already contributed to your 401(k) for this calendar year to avoid exceeding the contribution limit.  note that you may have another paycheck or two still coming from your old employer after you quit so it may take a little time to figure this number out.

## being unemployed

unless you have a signed job offer in hand, it's time to actually *act* like you are unemployed.

- hoard cash.  don't waste money on stuff you don't need to survive.  review your budget, cut any and all unnecessary expenses, stop eating out and going out to bars for drinks.
- you have extra time so use it to save money: cook at home, exercise on the cheap, read books from libraries instead of buying them.
- your ""job"" is now finding a new job.  
  - update your resume (get some feedback on /r/resumes), customize it to each job, and submit it everywhere.  
  - spend time every day on job search sites, linkedin, and communicating with your network.  set a weekly goal to send customized applications and resumes to a specific number of jobs per week (e.g., 20 jobs).

"for pretending to be an ""appletarian"" (eating only apple derived foods/drinks) for 3 weeks as a prank, causing my friends to have an intervention for me?. i got the idea a few weeks ago to prank my friends my pretending to be an ""appletarian"", meaning somebody who only eats food products that are derived from apples and would only drink apple juice or apple cider. 

i told them them all that i had read on the internet that eating only apples was the healthiest thing for you. when i first told them they thought i was joking, but they underestimated how committed i would be to a joke. so, whenever in the presence of one of my friends (or friend-of-friends/coworkers/etc who knew them) i was very careful to only be seen eating apples or drinking apple juice/cider. 

apples whole, apples diced, apple sauce, the inside of an apple pie, baked apples, candy apples with the chocolate shaved off, etc. 

finally after about a week they bought that i had become an appletarian. they started giving me information about how unhealthy it was to only eat apples, and growing increasingly exasperated by it. some of them even got angry.

but i wanted to stick with the joke. finally, after the end of 3 weeks, i walked into what i was told was a movie night but was actually an intervention for me. 

they were all super concerned about my well being and had all sorts of information or whatever. finally i started laughing hysterically. they were confused as hell so i told them i had been faking it the whole time and had been eating real meals outside their knowledge. i even took out some beef jerky from my pant pocket to prove it and munched it. 

i thought they'd appreciate the joke but they were actually really annoyed. my girlfriend even broke up with me over this because a few days ago i had ruined our date night when i told the waiter i only wanted apples because i was an appletarian and had ""embarrassed her for a dumb joke"". 

in my opinion the joke was solid and they should appreciate my commitment to the prank. 

but, did i go too far?

"defaming a historical figure for their ""blatant racism"" is stupid. if you were around during the 19th century, you'd be just as racist as anyone else.. so much stuff on the web these days about how so-and-so should deserve to have all of their accolades taken back because they were racist. no shit they were racist -- when slavery was common, racism was casual. it's just how things were. despite how morally superior you think you are now, you would have been raised in a household where racist comments were normal, and you would have grown up with those same views.

it's absurd to suggest that we start altering our history to speak only of the people who were purely good by today's standards. we would literally have zero founding fathers in history books if we were to stop honoring them because of their racist views at the time.

note: this post inspired by a twitter rant about hp lovecraft's overt racism... who the fuck cares. dude was a good writer; his views were a product of his time. get over it.

&#x200b;

edit: my inbox hurts. thanks for helping me pass the time at work today, this is fun. also, i get it, lovecraft was *particularly* racist. still a good writer though, and his views shouldn't have any bearing on whether or not we can look at him that way. separate the art from the artist.

edit 2.0: this *really* blew up... thanks to everyone who came here to actually discuss this in an intellectual capacity rather than hurling accusations of being a white supremacist at me. i've barely had time to address any comments, but i've enjoyed reading them. if you're seeing this as a ""justification of racism,"" you're exactly part of the group of problematic people i'm talking about who want to pressure wash history with a broad stroke. it's important that we take into consideration the norms of the time when discussing the merits of our forefathers. as several people have mentioned here, it's really best to grade everyone on a curve based on what was normal at the time.

thank you for coming to my ted talk.",6
"i hooked up with a guy in my airport hotel room this morning before checking out. turns out he is on the same flight as me and guess what, he's traveling with his wife and kids.. i know reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. this morning i was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. so i got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. so i said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. after 45min to an hour of fun, i thought i'd never see this dude again because i'm flying home this afternoon (right now).

wrong. i went to the gate when they started boarding. guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? you guessed it. to make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and i can hear all their conversations. i'm in the plane right now and he keeps texting. i am saving screen shots in case i need them in the future. i'm sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. 

this is so uncomfortable.

tl;dr: hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. turns out he's married, and he and his family are on my flight home.

edit: i gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. he texted me just now telling me he found me on ig and fb so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. now i definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.

edit 2: a) i'm male. b) the wife does not know. he texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. and then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet i saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) c) i knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies

just wanted to respond to popular questions.

edit 3: hope you saw the screen shot, you know who you guys are. :-)",4
"does the size of a creature, or the size of its eye, affect what can be seen by the ""naked eye""? for example, can ants see things we consider microscopic? are ants microscopic to elephants?. edit: wow. i was expecting something along the lines of ""of course not idiot""  but this is now my top ever post. great discussion everyone!

also yes ants don't have eyes i know that now. i just meant something small that does have eyes.

edit 2: ok ants do have eyes.

also why am i on the front page for asking if elephants can see ants? this is the best day ever!

final edit: somebody gave me gold, and this has become the third top post ever on askscience... that is not how i was expecting this to go. thank you all!",9
