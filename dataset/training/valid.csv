"being nice to people you dislike isn't ""fake"" or two-faced, it's just common decency.. i'm so tired of hearing that acting pleasantly toward people i can't stand is somehow ""fake."" what am i supposed to do? call them names and glare at them all the time?

there's this girl in my larger friend group and i personally find her annoying and mean. she also tries way too hard to curate a ""cool tomboy"" persona and it just rubs me the wrong way. she assumes that i'm vapid and stupid because i don't hide that i care about my clothes and appearance and she has attempted to cause rifts between other friends and me. 

i clearly actively dislike her. that being said, i don't find the need to make it clear to *her* how much i dislike her and still try to treat her with respect. i would never tell her any of the things i wrote here.

i am of the opinion that my issues with her are solely mine and i don't find it necessary to treat her differently just because i can't stand her. i've always treated people i don't like with as much kindness as i can and, because of that, people accuse me of being ""fake"" or ""two-faced."" i think it just makes me not-an-asshole.",6
"by bringing a sex toy to a family birthday party. obligatory this was not today. it will be a year ago a couple days from now so everyone who was in attendance is reminding me of it. 

i was invited to a birthday party for an old friend. i asked them what sort of thing they wanted for their birthday and they said ""ever since i discovered bucky balls i've been really into 'adult toys.' ""

i didn't know what bucky balls were. but i know what ""adult toys"" are so figured the name was self explanatory. i thought it was a little bizarre to ask other people to buy you that kind of thing, especially since the invite for the party encouraged everyone to bring their families, but whatever floats your boat, i don't personally care. 

so i did some research and ended up getting them a pivot (combination cock ring/vibrator.)

i get to the birthday party, put my wrapped gift on the gift table, and all is well. we all drank champagne and socialized for a bit. i've known a lot of the people there for decades so we were briefing each other on how our kids are doing, work, etc. 

fast forward about 45 minutes we're eating cake and it's announced it's time to open presents. 

we gather around and the first present opened is a drone. i figure maybe not everyone there was a close enough friend to ask to buy an ""adult toy."" a few people had brought their spouses and kids along, too, so i assumed the presents known to contain adult toys would be set aside to open later in private. 

the next present was a raspberry pi gaming kit from their closest friend in attendance. if anyone would be trusted to get an adult toy, it would have been this guy. hmm, red flag. i then see my present was still mixed in with all the presents being opened. 

now i'm getting confused and getting nervous wondering if maybe they were joking and didn't think i'd ever actually get them a sex toy. 

third present is opened and it's giant jenga. that's when i made the connection. i frantically whip out my phone and google ""bucky balls."" they're a magnetic desk toy of little balls that you mold into shapes. my nightmare suspicion is confirmed. 

i'm trying to maneuver my way to the table to get my present back without making a scene but there were barely 15 people at the whole party so i was having trouble being discreet. 

just as i'm almost within arm's reach of the table, of course, mine is grabbed. paper is torn off and they turn the box over in their hands. it's not immediately obvious what it is to look at the box because it's just a nondescript image of a plastic doodad with a hole in it and a logo ""pivot by wevibe."" 

i hear ""wevibe, is it a speaker? how cool."" someone goes ""how's it work?"" and they start to read off the box, projecting for the whole room to hear ""powerful vibrations. intensify pleasure during sex with rumbly... oh"" voice trails off. 

we're making partial eye contact, totally red in the face and embarrassed at this point. people in the room who've known me as a schoolteacher for years are now glaring at me as the sick fuck who brought a sex toy to a family birthday party at 3:00 in the afternoon on a sunday. 

i quietly explain the mix up and, thankfully, most of the room is laughing so hard they can barely breathe. most of the people who had kids with them were less amused, with one woman having to usher out her 7 year old who was still going ""what is it? what is it i didn't see it yet."" 

some of the group invited me to every party they threw from then on and others never invited me anywhere again.

*tldr: a friend asked me for an ""adult toy"" on their birthday. i bought them a vibrating cock ring. they meant they wanted like a nintendo or dart board or something. it was opened in front of a roomful of families who've known me for years. they all think i'm a pervert now.*

"when i was pregnant i found out my unborn baby had down syndrome so i had a termination and didn't tell anyone.. recently i terminated my pregnancy after finding out my baby had down syndrome. i was 14 weeks pregnant and at that point i hadn't told my husband as i only found out 2 weeks prior that i was pregnant in the first place. 

i found out the results after i had a cvs scan. i was completely devastated because i wanted the baby, but i just don't think i could raise a child with down syndrome. i know it can be so rewarding and humbling and in some cases children aren't effected a lot by it but i couldn't take the chance. i'm not prepared for it. 

i'm not sure how others would've handled this situation but i only did it in the best interests of my self, which may be selfish. i have a heavy feeling in my heart and a guilty conscience. i think i'm going to have to go to the grave with this, even if it eats my alive. my family are strong catholics and are heavily against abortions.

"someone i've never met claims they own my house. hi everyone,  i wanted to get your opinion on something troubling. i'll try to be as detailed as i can be. we live in nyc if that helps. 

we were just away on vacation for a week and came back home yesterday. when we returned, amoung the other junk mail, there was a letter from a law firm for a person whose name i'd never heard before,  directed to our address. it said something along the lines of ""we've recieved notice that a foreclosure action has been filed against you,  please call us and we can represent you"". it also listed the names of the two people involved in the lawsuit, as well as an incident number for the county clerk's office. this letter isn't an official letter,  more of trying to drum up business for the law firm. we returned on sunday, so were unable to get in touch with the county clerk  until this morning. 

this morning we called the county clerk's office and they said there is a lis pendens filed on our property, not a foreclosure. we said ""how can this be possible, we've never missed a mortgage payment and have lived here for 6 years.  we had a title search and checked for liens when we purchased the house,  and we know the last 3 families to live here over the past 20 years, and it ain't these guys.  we've never heard of either of the people involved in this lawsuit"". the clerk couldn't really advise us, but gave us the name of the law firm who initiated the action, so we called them.  

they told us that the person in the letter (who we have never met,  spoken to,  or had any dealings with whatsoever) is being sued because the law firms client was in dealings with him to buy foreclosures to flip, but now is out a lot of money due to some nefarious dealings on the part of the first guy.  apparently, this con artist was required by the law firm to provide deeds to any properties he owns,  and among others he provided one for our address. how he got this,  i don't know,  i assume he made it in photoshop or something. he claims he owns our house and the one across the street, i have no idea if he actually owns the one across the street or not.  we are still listed as the owners of our home in public records and we have the deed.

i cannot stress enough how much we do not know the man claiming to own our house. we have never met, spoken to,  or had any dealings with him whatsoever. we had never even heard his name until yesterday. our house has never been in foreclosure, while we've owned it and for any owners before that.  we have an appointment for a consult with a lawyer on wednesday, the one who helped us buy our house 6 years ago,  coincidentally. but i have no idea what's going on or what this guy hopes to gain,  how big of a deal this is or how complicated this will be to fix.  any guidance or advice anyone can offer in advance with our meeting with our lawyer would be very helpful.  thank you all.

edit: hey all. thank you so much for all your guidance. figures that the post i made about potentially getting screwed is the one that takes off.... here's some more information based on everyone's comments. 

the chance that this guy has a legitimate claim to our house is 0.000000000001%. only a sith deals in absolutes, so i don't want to say the chance is nil, but this guy is a known con man, being sued for conning somebody else. i looked his name up online and apparently he keeps creating new real estate companies to fleece people out of money,  then escapes into the night.  he's done it at least 3 times that i can find, based off dismal reviews of his real estate companies.

unfortunately i can't speak to the people across the street because that was a flip that hasn't been sold yet. he may or may not actually own it,  i have no idea. 

at this point we are not personally involved in this lawsuit, our property is just associated with it.  the con man hasn't made any attempts to acquire our property, he is just lying to the law firm suing him,  saying he already bought it.  why,  i don't know.  the only thing i can think of is that he bought no properties with the money his business partner gave him,  and is now desperately trying to cover his ass with falsified documents. why did he not think that he would be found out? that's just the way malignant narcissists work i guess....

i definitely look into our title insurance standing. i'm a worry wart, so if it was offered to us, i would have taken it.

i'll definitely keep you all updated as we meet with our lawyer tomorrow and things progress. thank you all so much,  keep being awesome reddit. ❤",2
"for asking my girlfriend to stop talking about her period because it's gross?. throwaway for obvious reasons

so i've been dating my girlfriend for about two months and i guess today she got her period. she mentioned it slightly and said something about bleeding through her underwear. 

i asked her to stop talking about it because i thought it was gross.

she told me she understood, but i should know these things since we're dating.

i told her i didn't need to know anything about it because i'm not a girl and it's not my responsibility.

she told me that she understood and would just keep things like that to herself, but her friend called me an asshole.

edit: we are both 16 

edit 2: we aren't sexually active as she is uncomfortable with it. so it doesn't really seem like it's my responsibility for what her body goes through. 

edit 3: okay, i understand now, i am the asshole. i will try my best to maybe learn more about it and keep my mouth shut. i do really like this girl, but it was just something i was grossed out by. but i will start trying to be a better boyfriend.

thank you for the advice 

edit 4: i didn't think this would blow up as much as it did. and i get that i wasn't being open minded, but i am willing to help her through the pain she feels and buy her snacks and cuddle her into oblivion and all that. just, if she does complain about bleeding, i hope she keeps it to a minimum.

"for blocking my mom out of my life for making sexual comments to the guy i'm dating and potentially causing us to break up?. to preface this, i am 20, my boyfriend is 21, and my mother is 53. 

my mother has always been one to seek validation from others. she'll bring up pictures of her female classmates and ask me or my dad or my 24 year old sister how old they look or she'll compare herself to her sister (my aunt) and get my dad to say that my mom is prettier and skinnier than her sister. when pretty actresses are on tv she'll make comments to my dad like ""here's your woman. she's a redhead. you can go ahead and leave me for her"" and such. i'm sure you get the idea. 

i (barely) tolerated her desperation for approval and validation up until sunday when she did something awful. 

i am in college and met a great guy friend early last year when we were taking a few classes together. his dad owns a limousine company in my area for special events (weddings, prom, birthdays etc) but his dad was sick so he allowed my boyfriend, his son, to use the limousine to take us to the airport. my sister is in the military and is coming home for the first time in several months so we wanted to surprise her by picking her up in a limousine since she's always wanted to ride in one but has never gotten the chance to do so.

i asked everyone to please be nice to him because he and i had a few classes together and we are friendly. i didn't mention that he and i have started dating. i didn't want to tell them about us dating because i didn't want anyone making jokes or teasing us about it. he and i are seemingly very compatible and i wanted to get him comfortable with my family if it ever gets serious. we have only been dating around 7 months and date each other exclusively. we are boyfriend and girlfriend.

we (myself, my parents, my 21 year old brother, and boyfriend) leave and everything is fine for a few minutes until my mom starts making awful sex jokes. i can't even remember them all, but i do recall her saying something to him about paying ""another way"" and implied sex and blow jobs. she started talking about how her kneecaps are red (she got them from getting on them and cleaning the house) and she said she was going to do it again tonight for my dad when we got home. even my brother (who is the same age as my boyfriend) and dad were not feeling it after a while. i apologized to my boyfriend and asked my mom to stop. she didn't. if you thought it stopped when we picked my sister up, you'd be wrong.

after we got back home, i refused to get out and asked him to take me to my apartment. i was **so** embarrassed and my boyfriend was visibly uncomfortable. i have since blocked my mom's phone number and got my sister to bring the spare key i had given my parents so they no longer have access to my apartment. my sister comes here to visit with me because i can't stand to be around my mother. i have apologized so much to my boyfriend for my family and he told me that he's sorry, but he isn't sure if the relationship will go further and needs time to think.

"update 2 - washington state: neighbor is currently video recording me and has a camera directly pointed at my bedroom window. what can i do?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5r4lco/washington_state_neighbor_is_currently_video/)
update 1(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6sjjwt/update_washington_state_neighbor_is_currently/)

it's close to a year now that we've dealt with the worst of my neighbor. almost a year ago, we achieved the success of having an anti-harassment order granted. that summer, he was arrested for harassing us, and he stopped with the cameras and the noises.

but something was a-brewing behind those closed doors.

around early november 2017, we had a knock on the door one evening. it was an officer asking if we had heard gunshots in the area. we had not. soon into our conversation, he mentioned it was our neighbor who called and complained. they were aware of the situation and assured us that despite the situation, they have to respond to all gunshot calls. i was honestly not surprised that after all the quiet, something started up again.

the next day, a police cruiser parked across the street from our home. i was expecting someone to knock again and ask about gunshots. no one came to the door and the officer sat across the street watching my home for over an hour.

the next day, i emailed an officer i had been working with previously regarding the situation. the officer told me that my neighbor had been calling 911 every single day on my address for gunshots. by the time i got an email back it had been a week.

every. single. day. this man was coming home from work, eating dinner, tending to daily life, and calling 911 on us for shooting guns. the officer said he would look into seeing if this counted as harassment through a third party.

the new year came and went, and in early january, i emailed the officer back and his response was simply that the city prosecutor wanted to set up a phone conference to discuss the plan going forward.

the city prosecutor mentioned to me that at that point in time, my neighbor had still been calling 911 every day. even the morning of the conference call. she said they contacted all of my other neighbors to see if they heard any gunshots, and asked if they would testify that they have not heard anything come from our property. they also plan to charge my neighbor with some counts of harassment and wrongfully utilizing emergency services.  part of his deal with the arrest over the summer involved him able to avoid jail time by having good behavior, and they are looking for their time back essentially. his arraignment date came, and his pre-trial was set. came and went. it's being continued until next month. 

i am worried that he will try to continue this case until the end of time. our anti-harassment order expires soon and we will have to drag him to court once again to renew it, and spend more money. things are starting to feel pretty dim again and honestly, the recent continuance knocked the wind out of my sails. all i can do until i am called as a witness/victim, is wait.

8 months ago my husband passed away. he had an adult son from a previous marriage and the two of them weren't very close. i don't think they hated each other or anything like that. honestly, i think the divorce had more to do with it. because of reasons i won't go into here, his ex-wife basically had sole custody of their son and the two of them never had a chance to fix that relationship. 

anyway, my husband held some animosity about the whole affair because he felt like his son sided against him in the divorce. right before he passed he made me promise not to give his relatives any of his possessions (he had a bad relationship with his family and he owned some family heirlooms) and i asked him ""what about \son's name\"" and he paused and he said ""he doesn't get anything either"". honestly, i was shocked, but i was pretty much grieving at this point so i didn't question it. 

well, about a month ago his son reached out to me over email asking if he could have a couple of his father's items. he said he's been regretting that they never repaired their relationship and that he never got to say a proper goodbye. the items he asked about were small things like a gold lighter he remembers (i still have it) and a blue button up shirt (i don't know which one specifically, but i still have all of his old clothes). i responded and told him that unfortunately it would go against his father's wishes to give him anything and he replied very politely ""i'm sorry to hear that. thanks for responding."" and that was it. 

about a week later his mother sends me an email calling me names and a bitch for not giving her son the things he asked for and that i'm basically preventing him from moving on. i didn't respond and i blocked her email and i haven't heard anything since. 

i've been feeling sick ever since this happened. i'm still trying to move on from his passing and i'm not trying to stop him from moving on, i'm just trying to honor my deceased husbands wishes, but i feel like i've done the wrong thing and i don't know how to handle this.

my mother's trying to convince me to buy a new car, citing the ""if repairs cost more than the car, get a new one"" rule, and ""many"" of her friends' anecdotal experiences about encountering more problems once a repair of this scale is completed.

"my coworker is a wannabe red pill pickup artist who has been trying to use his rp game on me (as one of his platonic female friends). i am fucking with him by treating him exactly like the women he fucks.. no regrets

my coworker dates multiple women and strings them all along via ""alpha"" behavior (plating, i think they call it), emotionally manipulating them to be at his beck and call sexually while simultaneously downplaying and mitigating their own emotional needs. he is very misogynistic and holds a very low opinion of women in general. he is very proud of being able to ""land"" any woman he puts his mind to, even though he is average-looking and not in that great of shape. 

he has not come out and said he is a ""red pill"" guy, but he is very active online and it would not surprise me in the slightest if he ascribes to that philosophy - his behavior certainly mirrors that. he even bitched about being friendzoned to me the other morning by a girl who had the nerve to take her shirt off after getting drunk at his apartment, but then later (sober) telling him she wasn't interested in him as anything more than a friend. in response to this, he cut the friendship off cold.  

to his credit, his whole asshole attitude towards women apparently kind of works (at least with a certain class of desperate women, anyway), and i'm sickened that anyone regardless of their gender would let themselves be treated as a social/sexual commodity like that. but whatever - different strokes and all. i'm not fucking him, ever, so i don't care much one way or the other. 

as his friend though, i hold him at arm's length in a way i've never done with my other friends. i'll go hours without answering his texts just to make a point that *i'm* not at his beck and call. sometimes he'll call and i won't even bother answering for a couple of days. 

a few weeks ago he cancelled plans to go to the movies with me and made a point to tell me he had made a date to have sex with another woman he met the night before. my less-than-interested response to this revelation - ""eh, fine, whatever, not like the theater is going anywhere"" noticeably surprised him. awalt? not quite bitch.

it's like he was expecting me to jump up and get jealous of her or something, or upset that he broke our plans for another woman. sorry bro - i don't give a shit one way or the other. 

the next day, after i didn't give him the expected reaction to him cancelling our plans, he texted me and wanted to drop everything i was doing to spend time with him. i told him i was busy with some other people and blew him off. 

i am aloof and show only marginal interest in his romantic conquests, which he feels compelled to talk about in detail. i don't disclose mine at all. he constantly tells me about sex with these women as if he's trying to make some kind of an impression on me about what a don juan he is, and i just shrug at him. i allude to doing things with other people on the weekends, but don't invite him to do anything. i make him invite me everywhere and wonder if i will show up. 

and guess what? he does. he acts just like one of those clingy, dependent, emotional women rp guys are always getting so high and mighty about. 

it's almost like my perceived lack of interest in him just makes him even more interested in me. which is hilarious, because my sexual interest in him is exactly 0% and that's exactly how much sex he will ever get out of our relationship.

there is a lot to discuss. we did a little research and turned out her stories about getting married and her husband wanting the videos to go down were lies. she in fact is starting a membership program on her own website and wanted to use that excuse to get our videos at reduced prices, to post them later to her own website. she wanted to use the exclusivity to get some of our paid members and have a larger library at launch.

once she realized that we know of her plan, she offered to pay the full $700,000 however, we declined since we have no interest in allowing her to use our videos to compete with us. she even offered to pay $1 million if we agreed to take down the videos immediately upon the sale. we of course declined and informed her that we are no longer willing to discuss terms about selling our copyright. one other small studio that she has worked in the past had already fallen for her lies and sold her the videos at non-competing prices. we're happy we didn't.

we learned a new lesson. people lie in business to get better deals. ",2

"girl cheated on her boyfriend with me, and after telling him the truth he didn't believe me. some context: this chick and i knew each other in high school and we had some small sexual tension that we never really explored because she got pregnant by some other dude.

flash forward a couple years once we've graduated and she finally broke it off with her baby daddy, and is dating another guy who also went to the same high school. this new guy was in the army and was stationed pretty far from us. she decides to hit me back up saying how she missed our friendship and that we should catch up. she was always so nice so i decided to take her out to some delicious ramen and then a cute movie. it didn't take much to wow her and we were already making out halfway through the movie. after the movie we don't really want the lil date to end so i suggest we chill back at my place. once we got there we started making out again and fucked. afterwards she tells me that this is our little secret and not to spread it. i agreed and only really told my closet friends who i know would never spread my business.

flash forward a month or two, i see that her current boyfriend messages me on snapchat which is odd, i forgot i had him added. he said ""be real with me, did you and girl fuck?""

honestly i just left the messages opened trying to figure out whether or not to tell him but then i got a little empathetic because if i had a girl i would want to know if she's messing around. so i told him ""yeah"" and just he just took a screenshot of the messages. i figure he already knew which was why he was messaging me  directly. 30 minutes later this chick starts calling me saying ""hey my friend told boyfriend that we fucked so if he asks, just tell him no.""

""oops i already told him, sorry i felt empathetic. i don't know why your friend leaked our business but don't get me involved in this drama""

she then starts to freak out over the phone like ""noooo no no no noooo this can't be happening what the fuckkk""

i hung up cause i was at work but i still feel her blowing up my phone but i don't answer cause her constant calling killed my battery. i get out of work a couple hours later so i charge up my phone and called her asking what happened. i was surprised she even answered and she sounded pissed. she just hanged up after i asked what was happening and gave a huge ""uugghhh"" before she hung up lol.

i noticed that the boyfriend messaged me saying ""shut up pussy, you can't get none""

at this point idk what to even say so i just replied ""lol tru"" i'm just sitting here baffled that this chick somehow convinced her boy that we didn't fuck and that i was just joking. like damn her deception game strong af lmao

tl;dr: i fucked a chick with a boyfriend and when he started asking questions i told him the truth. somehow the girlfriend convinced him that i was only joking and he just called me a pussy who can't get none lol

she had a fat ass doe 👀

"by crying on a date. tifu. so i'm a recently single dude after a 9 year relationship, and struggling to pick up the pieces of my life, balancing a new job that involves tons of travel. it's been a rough few months, so my buddy being the great friend he is, set me up with a friend of his sister.

we meet up for coffee and hit it off, then decide to head back to my place so i can try and woo her with my mediocre cooking skills. we end up making an awesome stir fry together and things are going great. i excuse myself after the meal to change because i ended up with a stained shirt trying to show off my nonexistent culinary prowess. anyway, i came back to the living room, and my date was checking out something on my side table and my stomach sank. 

i put away all of the stuff relating to my ex except for one thing. we were engaged, it was to be a gift for our last dating anniversary before the wedding. a miniature dock light from a book, a symbol between 2 literature nerds from the very beginning of our relationship. so here my date is, being incredibly sweet and asking about my knick knacks. i didn't really want to get into it, so i told her a partial truth that it was from this book i really liked, leaving out the collosal significance it once held. 

the next thing i know she's queuing up the movie the book was made into on my tv and inviting me to come ""chill"" with her on the couch. so here i am with this poor woman half way through a movie, my head swirling with memories of my ex that i am absolutely still in love with and i start crying. this isn't a sneaky tear either so she obviously notices and askes what was wrong... by this point i know i'm fucked, and i do my best to choke stuff back and stammer out an apology saying ""i lost touch with a good friend, and this was our favourite movie and i miss them more than i thought"". so now the mood has completely changed, and after some awkward small talk she suggested we reschedule and took off. now i'm sitting here sipping whisky directly from the bottle, trying to decide if i should hit up tinder or therapy...

let a date pick a movie my ex and i loved, and ruined any chance of sexy times by crying over said ex.",4
"or rather awta - we told our friend that his gf is no longer invited to hangouts.. we're a group of friends that have known each other since grade school. our friend ""paul"" has been with his gf ""ella"" for 2 years going on 3. we met her after they had been seeing each other for 1 month and have known her since. paul took us aside early on and told us she suffers from severe anxiety and depression.

&#x200b;

our friend group is very close and hang out a least once a week. paul brings ella because she says she cannot be left alone due to her mental health issues. we didn't have any issues with this at first, but after 2+ years we are kind of tired of her for these reasons: if we are doing an activity that day that she doesn't enjoy, she will complain the entire time. she is picky so she has the final say in all restaurant choices. despite being around us for 2+ years, if paul gets up to get a drink or use the bathroom she will follow him. she also rarely speaks to us directly and kind of uses paul as a sock puppet to tell us things. when she does speak to us directly, it's usually to call us out on something. some examples include walking past a homeless man and not giving him money, spending too much money on x when you could have given it to charities instead, etc. mostly moral things.

&#x200b;

we have told paul multiple times that her behavior (mostly the complaining part) is unappreciated. every time he's tried to talk to her about it, he says it causes her to have a panic attack. we love to hang out with paul and paul gets very upset if we choose not to invite him to things because of ella, but we're kind of tired of only doing things ella likes and eating at the same 3 restaurants. so last week we told paul that when invite him to things we are only inviting him. we decided that ella is invited to big events like christmas parties and the occasional hangout, but only when we literally invite her. paul did not take this well. he said we are being cruel to someone with mental health issues and are only going to exasperate her anxiety and depression. he also feels like we are basically asking him to choose her or his friends. 

&#x200b;

side note: we're all in our mid twenties. this isn't about ""bro time"". our friend group has women and men and we don't have any issues with any of our other so's.

"bank of america - won't put more than $3k in fraudulent charges back in my account after three months. a warning to anyone thinking about using any bank of america services.

i finally had to file a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau, which oversees companies such as bank of america. i suggest you do the same if you're having problems with boa's customer non-service. https://www.consumerfinance.gov/

i'm also taking to social media (starting with bank of america's own facebook page as well as reddit and twitter) to voice my complaint.


i contacted bank of america on 7/2/2019 regarding several large charges that hit my checking account from a company called blueorange. the charges were for $1,899.99, 1,299.99, (both hit my account on 6/28/2019) 199.99 and 129.99 (both hit my account on 7/1). there were also several ""international translation fees"" that hit my account in the amount of $57, $39, $6 and $3.90.

this is a total of $3,635.86 stolen from my account. 

i called in to bank of america on 7/2 after discovering my account balance was off so much and discovering the charges. i was informed someone had my bank check/debit card information and that's where the charges were coming from. bank of america immediately closed my card and issued a new one and opened a dispute/claim on the charges from blueorange. for some reason they broke the charges into three separate claims, one for the $1,899.99 charge (claim #190628504171), one for the $1,299.99 charge (claim #190628504292), and one that combined the two charges for $199.99 and $129.99 (claim #190702508226).

since this was obviously a lot of money for me to be missing out of my account, i wanted to know when it would be returned to my account. i was told by the representative that she broke the charges into three claims to make it more likely that they would put the money back into my account while the claim was researched. then i was told the larger amounts wouldn't be put in my account, but the two smaller chargers would. this was very upsetting to me because it was the beginning of the month and i had bills to pay.

i also mentioned during the call that i had been a victim of identity theft where whoever had just about all my personal information imaginable filed a federal income tax return in my name for two consecutive years, applied for boat, car and payday loans, and even tried to open numerous checking accounts in my name. this was of little interest to the bank of america representative. 

i google searched this blueorange that hit me with all these charges, and found out it's a scam bank out of latvia that is notorious for not only scamming  people out of money but money laundering. 

on 7/9 i noticed in bank of america's online message center that the claims were resolved and would not be paid. i was very upset and called in to bank of america. i asked how this could be? i was told that bank of america claimed they contacted me and that i approved the charges in question, which was ludicrous. i said so to the representative. at first i was told i received a call, which i didn't. then i was told i didn't receive a call but i received a text approving the charges. i told them this was just not correct, that they kept changing their story and it seemed like they just didn't want to reimburse my account for these fraudulent charges.

the bank of america representative said he would note the account that i wasn't contacted nor did i approve these charges and the claims would be reopened and escalated for a quick resolution.

i also went into my local branch in mid-july to speak to a manager and let her know everything that happened up to that point and she did absolutely nothing. it was a waste of an hour with her on hold calling the same fraud department regurgitating the same story they had already given me. 

i called into bank of america's fraud department several times between mid-july and mid-september for an update wondering why it was taking so long for this to be resolved and the money to be put back in my account. each time i was told it could take until the last week of september or so based on the 45 days, or 60 days (i was told both) it can take to resolve fraudulent charge claims.

finally on 9/25/19 i still hadn't heard anything from bank of america. i called in and was told that they were past the 45 days it should have taken and the person i spoke to was going to make sure there was a resolution in the next day or two.

i logged in on 9/26/19 and once again all three claims said ""resolved"" and ""unable to pay.""

i was very upset.


it appears bank of america didn't even do any real research like this because when i called in to bank of america's fraud department on 9/27/19 to find out why they didn't pay these fraudulent claims on my account, i spoke with susie in arkansas and she once again told me all the notes said is that bank of america claims to have contacted me on 6/27/19 and that i validated the charges, which is crazy. i looked back on my history and i see no calls, no messages or anything from bank of america on 6/27.

i let susie know all that had transpired and she was shocked that bank of america had, and i quote (i also have a recording of this call) ""had not been an advocate for its customer but instead had been more of an adversary."" susie seemed genuinely concerned (the first person at bank of america i had talked to that actually did seem concerned about what happened to me) and said ""it seems to me like someone here just swept this under the rug and didn't want to deal with it."" she also saw the same thing i did about this blueorange apparently being some kind of foreign scam bank or company. i also requested documentation of the research bank of america actually did on these claims be sent to me.

susie wrote everything we talked about as well as her opinions on how i (as a customer) as well as the disputes/claims had been treated so far during this nightmare and reopened the claims. she wrote down what we had talked about and entered them in the claim notes and said she was sending this to an upper manager who should read it on 9/30/19 or 10/1/19. i also let her know i would probably be filing a complaint with the consumer financial protection bureau because i see no other recourse at this time.

i would like this resolved and the funds that were fraudulently taken from my account put back immediately.

i believe this entire situation reflects very poorly on bank of america and how it treats its customers. i also wanted to warn anyone thinking of banking at bank of america to think twice about that decision.",10
"update i (29f) found a bra under our bed. it isn't mine.. link to original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ashm38/i_29f_found_a_bra_under_our_bed_it_isnt_mine/

hello again everyone. i just wanted to say thank you to those of you who gave advice and support about my situation, and i just wanted to provide an update to let everyone know how it went.

for those who just wanna cut right to the chase; the bra was his!

i decided that the best course of action would be to confront him about it when he got home. i told him i needed to talk with him, and when we sat down i threw the bra on the table and told him to explain what the hell was going on. his immediate reaction was of guilt, and he didn't say anything for a while. this set me off because i was already stressed out and i began to cry, and yelled at him to tell me why he was fucking another woman.

he said that he wasn't cheating on me, and he hoped that it never came out, but he said the bra was his. he said that he likes to wear it sometimes and it must have ended up under the bed and he forgot to hide it. i was still crying and i told him that he was full of shit and i couldn't believe his excuse.

we sat in silence for a while before he eventually asked me to come with him. he took me into the spare bedroom and dug through the storage closet and pulled out a locked suitcase. inside the suitcase was all of his crossdressing stuff; bras, underwear, stockings, dresses, etc. he even had the panties to match the bra to prove he was telling the truth.

i was honestly shocked and pretty blown away. i didn't really know how to react. he told me that he had been dressing up for many years, but it was purely sexual and no other reason. he said he didn't want to tell me because he didn't want to scare me away and lose me. he said he would get rid of it all.

i was still pretty speechless and couldn't say much about it. i didn't really know how to process it at first. we didn't really speak much about it that day, or much at all for the rest of the day either. i told him i just needed a bit of time to process it all. i asked him to sleep in the other room that night.

upon having time to think i calmed down a lot. i think the relief that he wasn't cheating on me really sank in. i figured that what he was doing, while very weird to me, was pretty harmless. the next day i told him i was sorry for accusing him of cheating. he said he was sorry for hiding it. we talked about it for a while. i told him that he if he wanted to keep dressing up i would support him, and if he ever wanted to bring it into our sex life i would be willing to give it a try. he seemed happy about this but needs to think it over a bit more in the future.

i feel bad that i didn't trust him, but it is relieving to know the truth. once again i wanted to thank everyone who gave me advice. to those of you who suggested the bra was his, i'm sorry i disregarded your suggestion. you were right all along.

tl;dr: confronted husband about cheating. turns out he was into crossdressing.",7

its a dog you fucking mollocks. no shit its gonna bite the little cunt if it starts poking it into the eyes with a wooden stick. if its ok for you to kick a dog whos aggressive towards a kid, surely its ok for me to kick your kid if s/he's hostile towards a dog. your soon-to-fail-highschool loser kid isn't any more special than a dog is and as such doesn't deserve some special silkglove handling and treatment like s/he's the second coming of jesus. this is the real world, if you fuck with someone, whether its a dog or a human, say by slapping them on the face, you'll probably and rightfully get your ass beaten right on the spot.

its not the kids responsibility to know better, the same applies to the dog. its the parents who should make sure that their walking disaster doesnt risk getting its hand bitten off. its not the dog owners who should be actively avoiding kids if the kids are the aggressors to begin with.",6

 i see his car pull up close to me, and he offers me a ride because my home was a 10 minute walk away. because i trust ron, i get in the car with him. this is the first time we've been alone. we start a normal conversation, but it slowly changes towards boyfriends and asking me if i have one. when he pulled up to my house, my mother wasn't home. 

he starts rubbing his hand on my thigh while i'm in the passenger seat and asks if he can come inside and wait for my mom. i told him no because my mom will be awhile. he insists. when we went inside, thank god my older sister was there. when he saw she was there, he decided to leave. as he was leaving, i felt a little 'pinch' on my ass as he was walking from behind me. i was so nervous i didn't know what to do. how should i tell my mom? should i just ignore it? i'm just really confused. i've always trusted ron.

the chief personnel officer pulled me into his office and made me play everything for him. i told him the full story of eveyrthing about the former employee and the evps attitude. 

to make him completely understand that i would not let this get buried, i told him that the former employee knows the whole thing. said that i planned to leave at the end of the week if the evp situation does not get handled. (did not tell him about the new job.) 

the cpo thanked me for my honesty, which by the way was a major red flag for me, and said he would be contacting the coo immediately.

"what to do when your partner has a crush. **edit: it's been about 3 months since i posted this, and i still get the occasional personal message from someone who is dealing with this stuff and looking for advice. i'm always happy to read your situation and offer my thoughts. i check this account a couple times a week, if not every day.**

reddit tends to have a black & white view of cheating that i find naive. crushes tend to walk the line of emotional cheating, but honestly i think they happen in even the most healthy relationships, and **as long as you both want to work through them, they are worth working through.**

my wife and i have dealt with crushes several times over our **10 years** together. once for me, and twice for her. i swear, if i asked reddit for help during the times she had crushes, cuz it was shitty times, it would have told me to walk away with a couple hundred upvotes, and that would have been the absolute worst advice. we've been married two years now (though we've been devoted to each other for ten years) and could not be happier. each time has been a chance to make both ourselves and our relationship stronger. so, i decided to share our success with reddit to maybe help other relationships. obviously you should leave a relationship that is not healthy, but i don't think you should throw away a relationship. (note: the crushes all happened before we were married).

#what are crushes?

crushes are accidental feelings someone has for another person (i.e. not their partner). this is different from people who seek out relationships via tinder, etc. usually they are with a coworker or classmate, because these are people they bump into a lot. they develop a friendship, and either over time or sometimes quite suddenly, they feel they ""hit it off."" they might feel the infatuation so strongly, it's like they are in love again. they probably feel confused and incredibly guilty because they love their partner so much, how could they feel such strong emotions for another person? and for you, it must feel like a huge breach of trust. you gave them their heart, how could they?

i think it happens by accident, and it's normal, and it's hard as shit, but as long as you both truly love each other and truly want to get past it, you can. and your relationship will be that much stronger if you do.

#what are the right conditions for a crush to occur?

crushes happen when there's a perfect storm of variables: **edit:** i got some feedback on this so i'd like to change it. ***crushes can happen at any time in a relationship for a various reasons, though i think the most pervasive crushes occur when there is a perfect storm of variables:***

**1. the relationship is strained** every relationship goes through hard times. there are ups, and there are downs, and crushes tend to happen when there are downs.

**2. you or your partner's life is strained outside the relationship.** maybe money is tight. maybe work is in overdrive. family is sick. life really sucks sometimes, and it can make us stressed, which can transfer into our relationship. we are more tense, and show our love less. we might still feel it, it's just harder to show because we're constantly stressed about other things.

**3. the partner is at work/school more than at home awake.** this one is pretty much all the time. we'll be at work or in class more hours in the day than we are at home with our partner. then he is accidentally spending more time with a coworker or classmate than he is at home. maybe they share an office, maybe they are in all the same classes. he's not trying to seek her out, they just happen to be in the same place most of the day/week. 

**4. the crush represents what you are dissatisfied in with your partner** this might be kind of a cold way to think about it, but relationships can be thought of in terms of pros & cons. for example, my wife is not into sci-fi like i am, but this classmate did. we bonded over our favorite star trek series, and before i knew it i had a crush. in reality, my wife has a hundred more ""pros"" than this crush, but this crush had a pro where my wife had a con.

#so, your partner has a crush... what now?

like i said, my wife and i have dealt with this several times over our relationship, and each time we've set ground rules, and each time we've come out stronger and more in love than before.

**1. keep open and honest communication at all times, and work through it together.** don't hide your feelings from your partner, even if you want to protect the other person. you might not want to talk about it, wether you have the crush or they do, but you have to communicate. you have to know what your partner is going through at all times. *work through it together, and you'll come out together.*

**2. don't be alone with your crush** (like never meet up for coffee), because while she can't avoid working with him, she can avoid seeing him other outside of work. meeting up like that is a chance at taking intimacy to a deeper level. you might want her to cut off ties to him entirely, but often that's next to impossible to implement. think of this like a ""soft"" cutting off ties. think about it, you have your ""work friends,"" and then you have your ""friends you hang out with."" it puts a barrier there.

**3. never complain or joke about your partner to your crush** even the most innocent joke can indicate you are not happy with your relationship.

**4. spend more quality time together.** these crushes happen in part because we are at work/school more than we are awake at home. so, overcompensate a little. turn off the tv, get off facebook & reddit, and play board games or go for walks. i always think the free dates are more intimate than going out to dinner & drinks, because that can feel like throwing money at your relationship, but those can be fun, too.

**5. don't give ultimatums!!** this is a very common tactic in these situations, and i think it only does harm to the relationship. it might seem like a good test of their devotion to you, but when you are emotional (which you definitely will be if you are going through this), please consider you might not be setting a reasonable ultimatum. more importantly, giving any ultimatum (however reasonable) tells your partner that you value your needs over your relationship. even more importantly, giving an ultimatum forces them to work on the problem on their own, voiding the chance to work together, which is in violation of rule #1 above and makes it 10x harder to resolve. it says to them, ""i give up, it's your problem... fix it or it's over."" my parents got married on an ultimatum, so believe me when i tell you it doesn't work the way you think it should. i'm glad they got married and all because i exist and all, but that shit never got resolved. 

#giving an ultimatum ends the relationship, no matter what your partner chooses.

however, in the end, if your partner has a crush, maybe it's not worth it for you to work through their crush. it's a really hard process, and maybe you're not up to the challenge. maybe you really do value your own needs over this relationship, and wouldn't mind breaking up, which is why you might be tempted to give an ultimatum. but let's be real, that's not because of *their crush*, or anything they did, it's because you don't value the relationship enough to keep working at it when things get tough. and maybe you shouldn't value it, maybe it's a bad relationship and you should give it up, but just be honest about why you're giving up, (and don't give an ultimatum).

these above rules are really simple, and are relatively easy to implement. it's the emotional turmoil the whole thing puts on your relationship that is hard. *obviously, you need to set your own rules between you and your partner*, i'm just sharing what's worked for us. i hope this helps you if you ever find yourself in one of these not fun situations.

with the first crush, we set these ground rules together, and we've stuck to them, and they've all passed over. we were able to figure out the issues in our own relationships that contributed to crush happening in the first place, and so our relationship is that much stronger.

**edit 1:** thanks for the gold! i can't take all the credit, only half.

**edit 2:** some people have mentioned polyamory as alternatives to my suggestions. like i said before, these are ground rules we came up with together because it works for both of us, and neither of us are interested in polyamory. if that is something both you and your partner are interested in, you will need to set different ground rules, but other than that it's the same idea: open & honest communication, deep respect for your partner, and not breaking the ground rules, whatever you set. the same goes for threesomes and open relationships.

**edit 3:** to those ""alphas"" calling me beta-as-fuck, that i'm emasculating/compromising myself, that i can't keep my woman in line, etc.... this is advice for a healthy relationship. healthy relationships are built on open communication of feelings, and respect for your partner. if you feel like you should control your woman in order to keep her from looking at other men, then that is not a healthy relationship, it's a controlling one. and if someone is in a controlling relationship, chances are they are unhappy, and if they are unhappy, chances are they will be looking for another, healthier relationship. in effect, you are creating a situation that encourages cheating. 

and regarding me being ""beta-as-fuck"" i don't even consider that an insult. ""alphas,"" as i understand it, view women as objects to be controlled and used to meet the alpha's own needs. if you want to insult me, call me an alpha (though that would be undeniably off base in the first place)",8

"tl;dr airline says i was a no show on flight (but i can prove i was on it) and cancelled my return reservation - need advice. need advice or help about traveling home to the us.

​

on august 15th, i flew from the us to croatia with a stop-over in munich. my return flight to the us is scheduled for september 4th. i booked my flights through online 3rd party budget ticket agent.

​

my problem is that apparently the airline is saying that i was a no show for my flight from munich to zagreb in august, even though i was on the plane. they cancelled my future flight with them on september 4th claiming it is their policy to cancel return flights if a passenger no shows. (but again, i didn't no show. i was on the flight.)

​

i have called my travel agent company multiple times but get the same answer - they tell me every time that they need to verify with the airline, put me on hold, and then tell me the airline will not budge - the airline shows me as a no show and won't reinstate my return flight. the travel agency says there is nothing they can do since it is the airline's policy and the agency wants me to purchase a new return flight, which i cannot really afford, and don't think i should have to anyway.

i called the airline directly and they keep saying that their register is showing me as a no show for the munich to zagreb flight. but i was on that flight. when i arrived and boarded the plane in munich, i was told there was not an actual attendant to check us into the flight so we were guided to scan our tickets and board the plane, which i did, along with the other passengers. there are people who sat next to me on the plane and i had conversations with who can witness i was there, besides airport cctv which i am sure can prove i boarded the plane and exited the plane in zagreb. i have a visa stamp in my passport from going through the boarder in the airport. it is so scary to me to think this airline allowed someone to board the plane and has no record of them on the flight. what type of security is that??

​

i need help - i am at a stalemate. i am not sure what to do since i was 100% on that flight and it is the airline who made the mistake. i have been recording the names and numbers and taking notes of all my conversations. can anyone give advice on what i should do? i have 3 more days before my planned return flight should leave. any help is greatly appreciated.

​

tl;dr my airline made a mistake and said i was a no show even though i was on the flight. subsequently, they cancelled my upcoming return flight reservation. neither the airline nor my travel agent will fix it, as they both push it off on each other.

thank you all for helpful advice and support! there are definitely some suggestions made i would never think of and i will definitely look into. just some additional information and updates:

yes, i'm us citizen.

as someone mentioned about the luggage, i did have issues when i landed in zagreb, none of my checked bags made it to the destination. looking back, if they thought i was a no-show they might have pulled it from the plane. however, when i landed i didn't know that was a possibility and just thought my bags didn't arrive. i immediately filed a lost baggage claim, called the airline and they confirmed that my bags were on the next flight to zagreb. i received my bags the next day. while on the call with the airline there wasn't any mention of me not being on a flight.

&#x200b;

i've spent the afternoon on calls with the airline and they haven't changed their position, although they agreed to pull the flight manifest and notify me when they have more information.

&#x200b;

i had already thrown away my printed boarding pass and luggage tags. i'm making a customer services complaint with documentation of an e-boarding pass, iphone location data showing me in munich airport and then after the flight to zagreb airport (the times match the flight), passport visa stamp and luggage tracking sticker. i'll attempt to get the lost luggage form from the airport as well.",2

"by asking a girl to go for a ride in my truck. this fuck up happened last night.  i'm still dealing with the repercussions.

background.  i'm 33 years old, married to my college sweetheart with 1 kid.  my wife stays at home with our daughter and she's 7 months pregnant with our son due in late august.

last night, about 5pm she asked me if i'd run to sonic and get her a drink.  i said sure, no biggie and headed out.

i make this run at least 4 times a week because my wife has cravings for these slushies at sonic.

here's where i fucked up.

so i put my order in and a few minutes later this early 20s something waitress comes out to my truck (brand new dodge ram, all blacked out on 22s jacked up, dark tinted windows).  she is smoking hot, in cutoff jeans and on roller skates, and a little sweaty cause it's boiling outside.  i must have some roller skate fetish as my mind kinda blacked out for a minute thinking about how hot this chick was.  and in my defense, i'm not exactly getting any at home cause my wife is pregnant and it's 100 degrees outside so she's miserable all the time.

so she comes up to my window, and i roll it down and she says hi and hands me my drink.  she looks at me dead in my eyes and says ""omg i love your truck, it's so fucking sexy"".  i was kinda dumbfounded for a second as i processed that she said ""fucking sexy"".  for some dumbass reason my response back was  ""well maybe you should come for a ride sometime"".....and before the last word came out of my mouth i knew i had fucked up.

she says ""sure, just come by sometime, i get off at 9pm monday and tuesday.""

i smile, say ""ok cutie"" and drive off thinking to myself ""damn i still got it"", knowing full well that i'd never act on it because 1.  i'm not a cheater, 2.  my wife would literally murder me and dump my body in a river and 3. i'm not sure i'd even know what do with a 20 year old anymore.

here comes the pain i'm still enduring as of this morning.

8:45pm last night, my wife comes out of the bedroom not in her normal pp's (pregnant pajama's) and says ""do you want anything from sonic, i'm going for a slushi"".  i didn't really think anything about it at the time, and told her no.

as she leaves, i notice on our security camera that she took my truck.  whatever, no big deal, it's more comfortable for her to drive.  30 minutes later she gets home and she's visibly pissed.  she comes into the kitchen and tosses her slushi into the sink and it splatters everywhere.  i'm still unaware of my impending doom.  i ask her innocently ""what's wrong babe, did they not have your flavor or something?""  she looks at me with the stare of 1000 burning suns and says ""no, but sarah at sonic was really sad i couldn't give her a ride in your truck.  you're sleeping on the couch asshole"".

fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

**tl;dr - i'm a moron and i'm probably getting divorced because my wife found out i was flirting at sonic**

adding updates here

**update #1**

ok. my wife finally talked to me. she said i need to go apologize to the girl then come straight home, otherwise i might as well just go stay in a hotel. apparently the girl was upset when my wife told her i was married and she was pregnant.

i'm sitting in my truck in the driveway trying to figure out how the fuck i get out of this. reddit help!

**update #2**

well, guess who's banned from my local sonic now? god damnit. when i got there i got out of my truck and went inside and found the girl and apologized. she laughed about it, but her manager wasn't so amused. he started yelling at me ""how could you hit on someone with a pregnant wife, blah blah blah"" and the girl just turned bright red. i told him she hit on me first and i wasn't really going to do anything i was just flattered and didn't think when i spoke. nope, didn't care.

i'm banned from the sonic now. fuck.

**update #3 posted below - this isn't going to end well for me**.

got home, told my wife what happened and she's so pissed. it's like an episode of sopranos with all the fbombs and motherfuckers. so guess who get's to go back to sonic now with my wife in tow? yep, me. update #4 coming if we don't end up in jail.

**update #4 - what in the actual fuck just happened......**

well, we're going to have to find a new sonic, we're both banned now and sarah quit after her boss started talking shit at her for starting all this.  i think his exact words were ""take out the drinks next time and don't hit on the customers dumbass""  my wife just lost it, calling this guy all kinds of names and screaming at him for being a dbag.  he ran into the back and locked the door after she threatened to ""put his ass in the slushi machine"".  he threatened to call the cops if we didn't leave so that's what we did.  as we walked out to our truck sarah asked us if we could give her a ride home since we got her fired basically and her roommate couldn't pick her up for another hour.   (i guess her roommate drops her off and picks her up every day.) i'm not even kidding right now my wife is giving her a ride.  i'm sitting in the back and they are just chatting away up front like best friends.  she's laughing really hard right now about the whole thing (and calling me some choice names) and i told her and sarah (again) how sorry i was for causing all of it.  i think i may be out of the doghouse on this one.  fireworks coming up so i won't be able to post an update for a little bit.

**update #5 - guess who's coming to dinner???**

yep, you guessed it.  sarah is at my house right now, playing with my daughter.  the wife and her seem to hit it off and are now fast friends.  on the ride back to her house my wife being the nice person she is asked if she had plans.  of course she didn't have anything to do.  i fully suspect this is straight up pregnant wife payback.  she keeps asking me why i'm on my phone so much so i have to put it away for a bit.  my parents and brother are here with the kids and we're about to start shooting off fireworks.  this isn't awkward at all.  nope, not one little bit.   this is my wife getting me back for being such a colossal dumb-ass and i can't do anything but grin and bear it.

**update #6 - well i'm not on the couch anymore.....**

......but sarah is.  she's passed out downstairs cause she's drunk and we're all too tipsy to drive.  obviously my wife could drive her but she's playing the ""i'm too tired"" card and said she can sleep on the couch.  my wife is taking this too far, she knows she has all the power and she's making my life miserable on purpose.  i suppose i deserve it.  oh well, here's another shot of tequila down the hatch, i'm going to bed.    i will post update #7 when i wake up and figure out how to get this chick out of my fucking house.  jesus fucking christ.

**update #6.5 - come on mods!!!!**

i guess the mods just locked.  i'll keep posting updates to the original post as long as they let me.    happy 4th everyone, i need to sleep this tequila off.

**update #7 - would you like eggs for breakfast?**

my daughter just ran in our room and woke us up ""daddy it smells like bacon, did you cook me breakfast?"".  wtf???  i get up and go downstairs and sarah has apparently opened an ihop in our kitchen.  eggs, toast, hash-browns, bacon, pancakes.   as i turned the corner into our kitchen she smiles and says ""hey mr.hungover, too much tequila last night?  let me fix you right up"".   mind you, she's still her cutoffs from work, but she's tossed the sonic top and is now just wearing a white tank top.  (jesus lord give me strength)  i'm sitting on the couch with my little girl watching cartoons and she brought me coffee and two aspirins (i guess she found the medicine drawer in our kitchen also).  i can hear the wife is in the shower getting ready.  i'm reading some of your comments and messages.  basic themes ""send us pics of the truck or girl"" (can't do that my truck is so custom any of my friends that read this would know immediately it's me) or ""this is fake as fuck"" and ""your wife is a bitch"", followed by ""oh please dear christ i hope you had a 3-some last night"" and the best so far ""my name is nick, yep that's my real name.  i want you to say it when you're ramming both of them later tonight"".  thanks nick, i'll never get that out of my head.  i'm pretty sure i'm going to have to drive sarah home cause i have to leave for work soon.

**update #8 - ok this girl is nuts**

so as i expected, my wife didn't want to leave so i'm driving sarah home now.  her house is about a 20 minute drive so i'm already feeling it's going to be awkward as fuck.  we get a few minutes down the road and she leans over and changes the station.  i'm humming away at the music and after a few minutes of silence she says ""you know, i was really disappointed you didn't come downstairs last night"".  i'm floored.  what is wrong with this girl?  seriously?  with my daughter and wife in the house??!?  i look at her and say ""look you're a nice girl, and i made a fool out of myself yesterday.  but it can't happen, i love my family too much"".  she leans over and puts her hand on the inside of my thigh.  i jerk the wheel of the truck squirming away and almost run off the road.  ""sarah, seriously, you gotta stop"" i said.  she looks me dead in the eyes and says ""your wife will never know.  my roommate is gone, we can spend the whole day together"".  ""nope, sarah, not gonna happen.  i'm not losing my family for a one night stand, sorry"".  she sits back and huffs ""ok fine whatever"" and we sit in silence for the rest of the trip home.  i dropped her off and said bye and got the fuck out of there.  i'm at work now, pondering what the hell just happened and i'm debating if i should even tell my wife.

**update #9 - and troll of the year goes to.......**

sorry for delay, but it's been a busy day.  i decided that honesty was the best policy.  i came home from work and the wife and kiddo were playing.  i sat down and cracked open a cold beer, thinking about how good my life was right at this moment and was really hopeful whatever i told my wife in a few minutes wouldn't change that.  my wife got off the floor and waddled over to me and plopped on my lap.  ""you know how much i love you right?"" she said.  ""of course baby, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me"" i replied back with.  ""i need to tell you something though"".  she smirked and grinned ""oh yeah what's that?"".  i cleared my throat and looked at her ""don't get mad, but on the way to sarah's house this morning, she grabbed me and asked me to come inside with her, i didn't do it and i told her to leave us alone and that i love my wife.  please don't be mad at me i love you so much.""  my wife lets out a huge roaring laugh.  i'm not sure if she's happy laughing or pissed laughing.  ""honey, i told her to do that, to get you back for being such a pig, we're even now, ok?  don't ever even think about another girl again.""  a wave of relief washes over me as my heart rate drops down to a manageable level again.  we just hung out the rest of the night cracking jokes about it.  i'm never messing around with her again.",4

"for telling a girl that i'm not attracted to her beacause of her appearance?. yesterday, i (24m) attended a party. there were many of my old friends there. one of the girls, 25?, was someone who i was close to growing up but lost contact with after.

the two of us reconnected and talked. she was drinking a bit, although i didn't. later on, she was doing things like putting her arm around me, holding my hand, etc, which i stopped because i have a girlfriend and i told her so.

then, she asked, ""if you weren't taken, i bet we'd be together right now."" it was a bold thing for her to say and i guess it must have been the alcohol talking. i just responded, ""nah don't think so."" she was offended and asked me why. i just said ""you're not my type"". she asked me why she wasn't my type, and i was tired of her bugging me, so i said, ""you're just not what i'm attracted to.""

she got mad at me. she said, ""oh i get it, you're attracted to coked up skeletons like your girlfriend."" referring to the fact that my girlfriend is tall and skinny. i got defensive and said, ""well im not attracted to fat basic bitches like you."" granted, she's not even fat, just thick/chunky. but she does overdo the spray tan and she looks like every basic girl ever. i guess a lot of guys are after that look but not me.

"my fiance ended our relationship today because i liked my sons facebook post (of him and his dad fishing). he said it was disrespectful to him and gave me an ultimatum to never like anything he posts that includes his father or it was over. i did not agree to that and he ended it. am i wrong?. i am divorced, and my children are adults, out of school. he is divorced and his children are 6 (twins) and his son from his first marriage just graduated high school. 

i've never met either ex but the story is the same, they are crazy and lazy. 

he doesn't have a relationship with his son and sees his twins once a month. 

he is eight years older than me. 

my relationship with my kids father is not the same. 
we coparent and have healthy boundaries. we do not fight. 

my fiance has given me ultimatums in the past about my kids and then recanted them. it feels almost like he's jealous of them in a way.   he has the same issues with my sisters. 

he has asked me to make a lot of changes. i've moved farther from my kids for him, i have a successful career that he has once convinced me to give up, but i had to start working again after three months away from what i enjoy. i've made every change he has asked except cut off my kids. they don't ask me for money ever. they go to college. they are good kids. not in trouble. we literally are together maybe once every month or two. 

as i said, i was off for three months and got an offer for a vp job back in texas where i am from, we talked it over and i took it because his company is going through a sale process and we got an apartment here because he wants to move here when it's finished and closed in august. he currently comes down from ny every weekend.  he obviously cancelled plans for this weekend. 

my fiance has done a lot of things for me. he has given me nice gifts and helped me through things but, something in my gut tonight said this is not right. so i refused to agree to the ultimatum.  i have never had to depend on him financially but he wants me too. it feels like he doesn't want me to have any kind of relationship outside of ours. 

am i wrong in my decision to stand firm. his ultimatum felt irrational and controlling. 

i know he will call tomorrow.  i just need a perspective on how someone else would handle this.

i did not reply 

""i am absolutely devastated. i cannot focus and cannot believe this. i never thought this would happen and really feel you don't care or want to fight to keep us together. it's son hard to talk to you about your son and our differences. simply saying that you did not realize that liking that picture would hurt me and that you would not do it again would have resolved everything. but anything that involves your son or something you do gets blown out of proportion.

"my boyfriend had sex with me in my sleep and now that i'm awake i feel very sick to my stomach. advice?. hi this is probably going to be my first and only post on this app. but yeah basically what my title says. last night i went to sleep after smoking a joint (i smoke marijuana daily so it wasn't me ""tripping out"") while my boyfriend stayed up playing 2k. next thing i know, i wake up a little to my shorts off and my boyfriend sticking his penis in me. i don't know why i didn't fully wake up, i was too sleepy that i just let my body lay there. i don't even know what time it was. i don't even remember the whole thing. after waking up to him on top of me, the next thing i remember is not even moaning and feeling him struggle to put it back in me due to my vagina muscles being too tight and i finally was able to get myself to close my legs and make him off. 

fast forward to hours later. it's currently 5:35 a.m. and i'm fully awake. i woke up feeling so gross and dirty to where i felt nauseous and then i quickly remember what i had just explained to y'all and i instantly felt like i wanted to cry. i felt like i've gotten taken advantage of but is that even possible? he's my boyfriend...am i just being dramatic? i'm currently sitting in the tub. i wanted to wash myself but like (tmi) i don't even wanna touch myself down there to wash. i just feel dirty, ashamed, nauseous, and overall confused. 

update: i had failed to mention that he had gotten high with me too before i went to bed. its possible he was still high when he was having sex with me...maybe he wasn't in his right mind? or is this me trying to make up an excuse for him?",7

"for asking a fat lady to give up her seat to a late pregnant mother and her so. so i was on the bus yesterday and it was packed. but this lady was so big that none was able to sit next to her. now i had a seat on the bus for a while but as a student i give up my seat to other people as thats my schools expectation. but the entire time i had been on the bus this lady had been sitting in a 2 person seat by herself. now when i get on its already full with many people normally standing and it really got on my nerves that this lady had the audacity to take up 2 seats. but when a lady who was deep into her pregnancy and her so got on the bus it really annoyed me. after 2 or o minutes and no one had offered them or her alone i worked up the strength to ask her if she would get up and give her seat to the couple.

&#x200b;

thats where i stuffed up. so i asked her politely if she would give up her seat so the lady didn't have to suffer with the pregnancy as badly. (something along the lines of ""excuse me ma'm would you mind giving up your seat so the lady over there could sit down so its a less unpleasant experience for her, if you could i'm sure they would greatly appreciate it)

apparently this was super rude and she got really offended and started shouting that i was 'fatphobic' and rude and that she would report this slight to my schools headmaster and get me suspended or expelled.

"my (23m) girlfriend (21f) wants me to use a massive toy on her during sex but i feel uncomfortable. i guess this is half relationship advice and half ""am i the asshole"". 

my girlfriend and i have been together for about 6 months and having sex pretty regularly for the duration. now (seemingly to me) randomly she brings out a massive toy (we're talking like massive, like inhuman levels) and asks me to use it on her during sex. now i don't want her to feel bad about what she's into, but i'm not using that thing on her. it makes me physically uncomfortable, i lost the mood the moment i saw it. 

she doesn't seem to understand that to me this feels like she's calling me inadequate, and even if i know that's not what she meant i still feel that way. i'm not trying to control what she does by herself, but when i'm involved i don't want that toy to be. 

to be clear, this isn't the first time we've brought toys into the bedroom. pretty regularly i use a small vibrator on her and we've experimented with other (more regularly sized) vibrating dildos.

is there any way i can get her to understand what i'm feeling? am i the asshole for not doing it?

update:
 
so i woke up this morning to a post with over 400 comments and had a minor panic attack. i called my girlfriend and when she got to me she insisted that i tell her why i was so panicked. reluctantly i showed her my post. 

we've spent the past few hours discussing and going through the comments on the post. i think it's safe to say that we have come to a mutual understanding. 

first of all, what i picked up from her. i didn't really know why she wanted me to use it on her (although i had guessed she probably wasn't dissatisfied with the size of my penis) and so i found out that she wasn't wanting it for any sort of sensory reason, what she finds arousing about it is seeing how much she can fit in her. i also found out some other fetishes she hadn't introduced yet. 

what she found out was that my problem was not with her actually calling me inadequate but that it made me feel inadequate, not that anyone had done anything wrong but it was just my emotions about it. 

what we both learned about me is that i have a pretty deep rooted fear of inadequacy. from this to the fact that i go to the gym for multiple hours seven days a week because i was a fat kid who felt undeserving of attention from girls, to my height (5'6). that's something that i need to work on, but it isn't something that will be fixed by me using the toy on her even though i feel uncomfortable. 

so now the all important part where i tell you the decision we came to. we decided that we would explore other fetishes she has that don't give me the same feelings for now and this is something that we may revisit down the road at my discretion when i feel like i've worked through the root issue enough. 

tl;dr we aren't using it for now, but it may be revisited when i've figured out the root problem of my emotions regarding it.",7

"a guide to efficient banking. **tl;dr** \- checking accounts are over-used. you should keep most of your money in a high-yield savings account and use credit cards for all of your purchases. the credit cards should autopay from your savings account. checking accounts should only store money you might need for immediate transfers, such as atm withdraws or paypal/venmo.

# a guide to efficient banking

**""efficiency is intelligent laziness""**

i'm a very lazy person. however - i've found a system for my finances that works well for me. it's easy to manage, and i believe it to be a significant improvement over ""typical"" banking.

when i say **typical banking**, this is what i mean:

* checking accounts: used for money you plan on spending (bills, food, gas, etc.)
* savings account: used for money you don't plan on spending anytime soon (emergencies, retirement)
* credit card account: used for purchases you can't afford but have to make - avoid if possible (hospital bills, car repairs)

if you agree with any of those 3 statements, you may benefit from this post. if you'd like to skip the storytelling, scroll down to the ""efficient setup"" section.

**""are we doing this because it's right, or because it's the way it's always been done?""**

this is one of my favorite questions to ask during meetings at work, and i recently found myself asking the same question about my bank accounts. in order to accurately answer this question, i decided to analyze the different types of accounts and track my thoughts.

**breakdown: checking account**

there is no limit on monthly transactions. money used in purchases immediately leaves your account. atms allow you to withdraw cash. account balance typically accrues little to no interest.

* a checking account is like a 'digital wallet'. it's almost identical to carrying around cash. i can't spend cash i don't have - cash leaves my wallet as soon as i spend it - i don't earn cash by leaving it in my wallet.

**breakdown: savings account**

there is a limit of 6 monthly transactions. money used in purchases immediately leaves your account. account balance can accrue higher amounts of interest.

* woah - the interest rates on these accounts are nice. if i had a debit card for a savings account, and if it weren't for the monthly transaction limit, i wouldn't even need a checking account.

**breakdown: credit card account**

there is no limit on monthly transactions, but there is a limit on monthly spending. money used in purchases stays in your account until the credit card payment is made. rather than gaining interest, you risk being charged interest if you don't pay the full statement balance. if you can't make the minimum payment, there are other fees as well. to motivate usage, many credit cards have a ""rewards"" program for points or cash back. some credit cards also have signing bonuses - such as a period of low interest or an 'initial spending' reward. like most ""bills"", allows for automatic payments. proper usage builds credit history, which may help in future financial situations.

* being charged fees for missed payments is scary, but if i set up automatic payments than i should be fine. i don't want to be charged interest either, so i definitely don't want to make any purchases i can't afford paying off immediately. the signing bonuses and rewards are enticing though, and i want to improve my credit score.

**breakdown: conclusion**

after breaking everything down - i started trying to piece it back together. the ""typical banking"" routine didn't hold up. rather than only keeping a subset of funds in a savings account and avoiding credit cards, it would be much better to only keep a subset of funds in a checking account and utilize credit cards for all purchases. this would maximize cash back rewards and maximize interest earned on money. not only that - since a credit card transaction doesn't immediately remove the money from your account, the money will accrue interest in the savings account for longer.

# the ""efficient"" setup

* checking account: used for money you may need to use immediately. for example, atm withdraws and paypal/venmo transfers. i almost never have these types of transactions, so i keep about $150 in my checking account.
* savings account: used for all money that isn't in the checking account. use for automatic payments to your credit cards, adding more funds to your checking account, and transactions that can't go on the credit card (maybe rent, car payment, credit cards)
   * you can open multiple savings accounts if it helps you track specific savings goals, or if you need more than 6 monthly transactions you can't make on a credit card.
   * if you aren't lazy, you might want to take a portion of this money and do other fancy finance things instead of letting it stay in a high-yield savings account
* credit card accounts: used for as many transactions as possible to maximize cash back/rewards. you only need 1 card for this setup to work, but you might benefit from having multiple cards.

**specific setup**

checking account: i use charles schwab for my checking account. it's an online bank with no monthly fees, unlimited atm rebates, and 0.40% apy interest. i never really deal with cash, so i am fine with an online bank. this bank plays well into my expected usage of the account.

* read more: https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking\_lending/checking\_account(https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/banking_lending/checking_account)
* note: if you can get a referral code, schwab will give you $100 after 1 month of having your account open.

savings account: i use ally for my savings account. it's also an online bank with no monthly fees. it currently offers 2.18% interest, compounded daily, which is estimated to be a 2.20% annual percentage yield.

* link:  https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/(https://www.ally.com/bank/online-savings-account/) 

credit cards: i use 3 different credit cards. you should find the right credit card(s) for you, but here is what worked for me:

* citi double cash
   * this card gets 2% cash back on all purchases. i use this card for monthly bills (power, internet, phone) and any purchase i don't use another card for. if you only wanted to use 1 credit card - this would be my recommendation.
   * read more:  https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?id=citi-double-cash-credit-card(https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?id=citi-double-cash-credit-card) 
* barclays uber
   * i use this for 4% on dining and 3% on hotels/airfare. it also has a signing bonus - spend $500 in the first 90 days for $100 cash back. if you're planning on applying for multiple cards - apply for this one first. barclays is picky. i have a good credit score, but i was still denied. i called their reconsideration line and was approved after a 2 minute phone call.
   * read more:  https://cards.barclaycardus.com/banking/cards/uber-visa-card/(https://cards.barclaycardus.com/banking/cards/uber-visa-card/) 
* capitalone savorone
   * i use this for 3% on entertainment and 2% on grocery. it also has 2 signing bonuses. first, spend $500 in the first 90 days for $150 cash back. second, 0% apy for the first 15 months. i'm ""budgeting"" the full statement balance on this card, but only making minimum payments during the 0% apy period. if i had outstanding credit debt, i would have done a balance transfer to this card (3% fee) and then paid off as much as possible when the 0% apy period ended.
   * link:  https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savorone-dining-rewards/(https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savorone-dining-rewards/) 

i've been operating like this for a couple of months now. i had to do some work up front, to open the accounts and change my direct deposit account info, but that wasn't too bad. i also had to change my payment info for my monthly bills. my rent charges a $25 fee if i use a credit card, so it pays straight from my savings account. after that, all i had to do is use the right card for the right purchase. the automatic payments take care of the rest. i'm only using 4 of my 6 monthly transactions for my savings account.

**results**

this setup won't make you rich, but i guarantee it will be better than ""typical"" banking. it will save you 2% to 4% on almost all of your purchases and will earn you \~2.2% apy on more of your money. since it's a percentage-based difference, the benefit is different for each person and is also different month-to-month. the best part is how simple it is. once you get it set up, it's mostly automated. just use the right card for the right purchase, and don't spend money you don't have.",10

"i think my husband might have caused our neighbor to commit suicide. my husband and i live in a neighborhood where the houses in the street behind us have their garages facing ours. we share a connecting back alleyway. one morning, our neighbor's daughter was pulling out from her driveway when the back of her car hit our fence. it shook the fence but besides a smear of paint from her car and a decent sized crack in one board, there was absolutely no damage. we were both in the backyard when it happened so we knew what she had done. 

my husband went out to confront her. she started screaming and sobbing uncontrollably, begging him not to tell her father and repeatedly saying that he would ""kill her"" if she found out. she offered us money from her own savings to fix the fence. my husband accepted the money, which she brought us immediately. she kept asking if he would tell her father and he assured her that he wouldn't. after paying us, she left for the day. it was about 100 dollars in cash, although we had the boards and tools to fix the fence without any cost to ourselves. i wasn't happy but he insisted that it was good for her to learn a lesson in responsibility and safe driving. 

later that week, we learned from our next door neighbor that the daughter had committed suicide. i believe that's what happened because another neighbor next door to the daughter's house confirmed hearing shouting and seeing an ambulance outside the house while my husband and i were at work. my husband was pale and shaken for a day or two after. when i finally asked him why he was taking it so badly, he told me that after the daughter left and i'd gone inside, he waited until the father came home from work and told him that his daughter had not only hit his fence but paid for us to keep it a secret. he said the father seemed angry and slammed the door but didn't say anything else.

i doubt the father murdered her; i have the mother on facebook and she is posting openly about her daughter's suicide which i don't think she could do if there was a murder investigation. i do think my husband took advantage of a frightened girl and reported her to an abusive father. he wants my support and to attend trauma counseling but every time i look at him, i'm just disgusted. i think about how he took her money and lied to her face. i don't want to throw away a decade worth of marriage but when he asks me to tell him it isn't his fault, i just stay quiet. we have no children together but he's the only family i have. i need advice, i don't know what to do.

"by letting a friend at college convince his girlfriend he had a weekend job as a cargo plane pilot for fedex. tl;dr: i helped a friend lie to his girlfriend about being a pilot, and it nearly got her, him and me killed.  

for a longer tl;dr, see the end of this comment.  
  
my best friend at uni convinced a girl we he was dating that he had a weekend job flying cargo planes for fedex.  this was initially because he wanted to get out of some family event she wanted to drag him to, but it snowballed into an ""every weekend"" thing.  
  
it sounds like a bizarre random choice of weekend job, but there's a reason behind it: my family owned and ran an aircraft repair business on a municipal airport in ohio.  i grew up with airplanes.  when i was 16, my dad bought me a c-182 skylane that had been banged up in a bad landing.  we spent two years restoring it, and i took it with me to uni and kept it at a small airstrip just out of town.  i would use it to fly to/from home on weekends and breaks, and often took friends up for a ride.  it was a great way to get girls in bed.  something about being up there with a confident guy trading radio calls with atc seems to just do it for them.  
  
my friend, who had never flown in a small plane before he met me, decided it was definitely his jam.  i'd let him take the controls occasionally, but never for more than a few minutes and always at altitude (in case he did something stupid and i had to recover).  but as it turned out, that was a mistake of the ""knowing enough to get yourself in trouble"" kind.  
  
back to the girlfriend.  when she first wanted him to go meet her family, he panicked and said he had to work.  where did he work? she wondered.  he didn't actually have a job, so he picked the first thing that came to mind, his fantasy dream job: pilot.  but what kind of job would a university student have as a pilot? she wondered.  well, the lie was already out there, so he doubled down: cargo pilot.  and then to make it ""believable,"" he stole my story about growing up with parents who owned an aircraft repair shop, solo-ing at 15, licensed at 16, owned/restored his own aircraft that he kept by school.  the works.  
  
predictably, it snowballed.  he ended up liking the girl a lot and not wanting to break up with her.  but he had a ""weekend job"" that took him out of town.  that part wasn't so hard to maintain because i flew back home pretty much every week, and my parents loved him and always welcomed him for the weekend stay.  my dad even let him help out with repairs on a couple of aircraft on the theory that it would teach him a little bit about them.  not enough to keep him out of trouble, as it turned out.    
  
it's now about maybe 3/4 of the way through the semester, and the girlfriend is either stupid or blinded by love because she's totally believing his absurd story about being a cargo pilot for ups and owning his own airplane and whatever.  i'm sort of well-known as ""the airplane guy"" on campus, so she's heard of/knows there's a student who occasionally takes girls up on dates.  for some bizarre reason, it all makes sense.  but there's a problem: now *she* wants to go up in a little aircraft, with her ""cargo pilot"" boyfriend.  why can't we go flying during the week? she wonders.  why can't i come with you in your fedex airplane when you go on your weekend trips? she wonders.  
  
at this point, he *should have* come clean.  they've been having sex for several months.  she's probably not going to break up with him.  i mean, it's a funny story if you think about it.  ha ha.  i'm not really a cargo pilot for fedex.  i don't even know how to fly!  ha ha. funny, right?  
  
but he doesn't.  he doubles down on his double down.  he tells her he's going to take her flying that evening.  and so i get this frantic call in my dorm room.  ""/u/gaspronomib - ! - i promised girlfriend that i would take her flying tonight!  you gotta help me!  i need to borrow your airplane!""  
  
i was like, no.  no, you are not going to ""borrow my airplane.""  you almost always try to roll us inverted every time i let you take the controls.  you've never *taken off* in it, much less *landed* it.  if i let you take it out by yourself, you'll kill everyone on board and anyone with the bad fortune to be in the way when it falls out of the sky.  no.  
  
but he's desperate.  and it's to get laid.  so being a bro, i offer a compromise: i will let him pretend to be the pilot, and only take over when i think he's doing it wrong.  i'll even sit right-seat and let him wear the white shirt with epaulets with four stripes on them that i got as a joke reward present when i passed my ppsel (private pilot, single engine, land) license check ride so he looks like he's a real ""captain.""  
  
the time comes, and the girlfriend shows up.  and it only gets worse.  she's a little confused because we've never told her that i'm a pilot ""too.""  it would have been too weird.  a coincidence that big was too big of a plot hole in his elaborate ""i'm a cargo pilot for fedex"" story.  how could he possibly have me and become best friends with a guy who just happened to *also* be a pilot?  it just wouldn't have made sense.  so we never mentioned it.  and worse, i would occasionally pretend to know nothing about flying.  i'd ask questions like ""what's it like up there with just the clouds to keep you company?"" and ""do you need oxygen even when you're on the ground?""  stuff like that to make me sound like a real newb and let him show her what a knowledgeable cargo pilot he was.  
  
and so we tripled down on his previous double-double down.  you see, he's been giving me flying *lessons*.  that's the ticket.  yeah.  flying lessons. totally explains why you're taking your friend along on a date.  
  
to give him credit, he plays the fedex cargo pilot really well.  i always have new passengers follow me around when i pre-flight.  it helps with any anxiety they might have about going up in a small airplane.  so he does the same thing with her.  we do our walk-around, check fuel, control surfaces, oil, prop, gear, etc.  he explains exactly why we're checking each thing (same as i did for him the first time he went flying with me).  he shows her how to get into and out of the aircraft, how to work the door latches, her seat belt, etc.  inside he hooks her up to the intercom- correctly, even!  hell, by that point even *i* was convinced he was a cargo pilot for fedex.  
  
but as soon as we fire up the engine, things start to unravel.  i try to let him use the radio.  it's a small airstrip, no tower, so it's not like we absolutely needed it.  but he flubs up almost every self-announcement.  his radio voice sucks.  he's hesitant, stutters, can't remember the tail number, misidentifies the runway.  all the things wrong.  
  
and then it's time to take off.  by prior agreement, i was to do this without his help.  but he switches the intercom to ""pilot isolation"" which cuts off the passengers' (i.e. girlfriend's) headphones so we can have a private conversation.  ""/u/gaspronomib - ! - you gotta let me take off!  she's going to think something's going on if i don't.  i've watched you dozens of times!  i can do this!""  
  
and well, he's desperate.  and it *is* to get laid.  so being a bro, i say ok: i will let him take off, and only take over when i think he's doing it wrong.  
  
i line the airplane up at the end of the runway, turn the intercom back to ""on"" position, and say ""your plane.""  and then i take my hands off the controls.  in retrospect, this was a bad idea.  
  
time to fuck up: 3 seconds.  instead of pushing in the throttle, he pulls out the mixture.  this tells the carburetor ""don't give the engine anymore gas.""  the engine quits.  embarrassed silence.  
  
i pitch him an easy save.  ""so that means you leaned out the engine, right?  you said you would show me how to do that the last time you gave me a lesson.""  he was all ""ha ha.  yeah.  leaning out the engine.  totally.  good lesson.  you learned something there, dincha?""  
  
i restart the engine ""for him"" and then sit back in my seat again.  this time he hits the gas properly.  
  
time to fuck up: 9 seconds.  he's starting to veer off the runway.  i make a point of fighting him for the pedals, hoping the girlfriend wouldn't notice.  mission accomplished, probably.  at least we're heading straight down the center line and not for the row of aircraft parked on the other side of the taxiway.  
  
time to next fuck up: 15 seconds.  we're approaching 70kts airspeed.  time to rotate.  time to rotate.  why are you fucking not pulling back on the fucking controls?  he's not fucking pulling back on the fucking controls, and the aircraft is lifting off a bit on its own.  not terrible, but not great either.  i casually ""nudge"" the yoke backward.  he catches the hint and...  
  
time to next next fuck up: two seconds.  he yanks back too far and we're popping up way too fast!  this isn't a fucking blue angles air show, dammit!  i start to do something about it, but-  
  
time to next next next fuck up: nanoseconds.  he's doing the same thing he always does: pulling down on the yoke with his left hand.  i've told him about it a thousand times.  it always makes the airplane try to do an aileron roll.  or would if i didn't take over.  
  
so now we're nose up to the sky at a high angle of attack and about to do a wing-over.  at roughly 30ft off the ground.  this is not a good thing.  sure, it's for a good cause (getting a bro laid), but can you reasonably expect to get laid after someone shovels the raspberry jam that used to be your torso into a body bag?  i'm guessing not.  
  
about the time when we're in an absurdly low-altitude 60deg bank, i've had enough.  ""you're rolling!  my plane!"" i yell, and reach over to ""karate chop"" his arms off of the yoke.  i pitch down, level off, and regain control of the aircraft.  
  
nobody says a word as i finish the climb to about 1,000ft agl, re-enter the pattern on the downwind leg, and then bring us down to a landing.  all without any help from my ""instructor"" the ""cargo plane pilot.""  
  
the only thing i remember her saying on the drive back to the dorms was ""you're not really a fedex pilot, are you?""  
  
they broke up a few days later.  the story made the rounds on campus, and my friend took no end of shit for it, for which i gladly take credit.  i called him ""fedex"" for the next two years, to the point where the nickname stuck and other people started using it too.  i think my dad was the worst, though. between being mad at me for risking lives (and an aircraft- which was a much more serious offense to an old a&p mechanic) and laughing his ass off at my friend for trying to pull off a months-long masquerade as a fedex pilot, he dished so much shit at us it almost made me want to not go home for a while.  
  
other than the breakup and the nickname, there wasn't really much other fallout.  it even worked to his advantage a few times because girls actually thought the story was funny, and it got him laid at least one time that i know of.  which i guess means that in a way the whole thing was a success.  we stayed friends until graduation but lost touch, so i have no idea if he ever got his own pilot's license and bought an airplane as he said he would.  but even if he didn't, i like to think of him out there, charming the babes with stories about flying for fedex on the weekends and offers to take them up flying ""someday soon.""  
  
tl;dr: i, a pilot and aircraft owner, had a friend who convinced his girlfriend he had a weekend job as a ""cargo pilot for fedex"" to explain why he couldn't join her to meet her family.  the relationship lasted longer than he expected, and so he had to maintain the lie.  eventually, she called him on it.  but instead of fessing up, he made it worse by convincing me to let him fly my cessna 182 to take her up, passing me off as ""one of his flight school students.""  he did his best to take off, but instead nearly killed the three of us, forcing me to take over.  the lie was outed.  the girlfriend broke up with him.  and i, my father, and practically everyone at school teased my friend mercilessly for years about it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/cges5o/wibta_if_i_take_my_coworker_to_hr_for_touching_my/
 
 

i went to hr and asked them for advice to deal with the situation. honestly, she wasn't very helpful and said i should just keep working as usual/try to ignore him. i think they went and talked to him though, because immediately after my meeting he started avoiding me.
 
 

this was until two weeks ago, when i gave my notice.
 

 
they decided that louis should be my replacement, despite having absolutely no experience in my department. which means i've spent the past two weeks training him.
 
 

honestly, there's no other way to describe the experience except as ""hell on earth"".
 
 

there's too much creepiness to even write about; he's engaged in full creep mode this whole time. making all sorts of inappropriate comments. touching me whenever gets the chance and literally sitting an inch away from me. and he doesn't take notes or anything about how to do the job. he just stares at me and tries to make conversation.
 
 

you remember the office when toby touches pam's knee? that happened the other day. when we were sitting at my desk and i was training him. he straight up touched my knee and held his hand on it as he was telling me how proud he was of me. it made me so uncomfortable i got up and walked away.
 
 

i tried talking to hr about it. since i gave my notice, they've no interest in dealing with it.
 
 

yesterday was my last day and i will never have to see louis again. i'm so grateful for that, and for all of you for the advice i've been given.



edit: i've been asked a few times why i stayed and went through with the training.


my company gives out our yearly bonus at the beginning of september. they said they would still give it to me if i agreed to stay and train.


i'm quitting my job to go back to school so i was very financially motivated to just deal with it.

edit 2: i've got a few more questions so here it goes.

i've already received the bonus/my final paycheck. everything is in order.

"girlfriend doesn't want to sign a prenup. to make a long story short, i love my girlfriend but she is financially illiterate and doesn't save a dime.

we both come from very poor families, but i have always saved every penny, started investing when i was 14, and now actively trade as well. my portfolio is just south of 3.6m at 26 years old. my girlfriend earns as much as me at her job, but unlike me she spends her entire paycheque on dinners/clothes/shoes/concerts etc. she earns enough to be saving plenty but wastes it all on luxuries. her entire savings is like $100 and hasn't paid anything off her student loan.

now i don't have a problem with how my girlfriend spends her money, the problem is she wants it to be our money. she wants to get married, but doesn't want to sign a prenup. i want a prenup which clearly protects not just my current investments, but also future investments + investment growth. we would split all bills otherwise and also pay any mortgage equally. so our finances would be separate except for mortgages/expenses etc which we would split.

the reason for this is that i know my would-be wife would save very little and if we ever got divorced, i'd end up giving away a good chunk of my savings with nothing in return. it would be extremely one sided.

i know i sound like a greedy prick here, but i'm just trying to be blunt and i'm not as asshole sounding in person.

anyway, how do i talk to her about this? i am honestly not willing to get married without such a prenup. she said she's hurt i'd consider a prenup and that i'm not considering her feelings, but i also feel the same way. she isn't seeing it from my point of view.",7
"my step daughter (16) is pregnant. i (31f) am the one who pays for most of her education and i want to cease. her dad (33m) is disappointed in me. how do i proceed to make my point clear to my husband and step daughter?. i posted in aita, throwaway because husband uses reddit. english is not my first language. there is really no good tl;dr other than the title, but that leaves a lot of important info out, still tl;dr at the end. my questions are bolded.

**the reason behind why i pay for the education.**

my husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as an. an's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. an is now 16 years old, and pregnant. an stays mostly with us because i am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition, i do so as a payback from when my husband helped me out of a massive debt during our dating years when he made 5 times what i did during that time. he proceeded to gain the international/regional direction of a big company in our country and worked there for some years before he decided to start his own company. now i make three tomes more than what he is making, but i'm sure he'll double what i'm making within the next 5 years. it had always been my husband who paid for all of an's expenses, her mother took care of her from ages 0-13 while husband provided with money for everything and visited every weekend. we divide all of the other household expenses equally. an's mom has not given anything towards child support on the last two years because she insists she has no money.

when an turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(hs) in the big city we live in. we checked on hs and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private hs. she has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream and even study in the london school of economics (just like her dad with his masters). i have been separating some money for this purpose, too. my husband and i came to an agreement that i would also help her dream to come true, but i would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (an did not know this) and he agreed. an was not involved in this conversation because husband feared she would tell her mom and mom would take it as an offense and me saying teen moms are sluts or things i never even implied (she's that kind of person). this conversation took place two years ago... and now, an is pregnant as soon as she finished her first hs year.

**why is an pregnant and what about the future teen dad?**

i cannot be nice about it. an is pregnant because her mother has a turd instead of a brain. my husband and i started talking to her about sexuality, contraception (i even taught her to put on a condom in a cucumber, it was awkward but oh well), orientations, etc... and actually took her to the gyn and he recommended her the pill. she stopped taking it because her mom told her she would get fat (an was a chubby child and suffered bullying because of her mom), and started using the ""cycle method"" in which she had sex some days before, during, and some days after her period. 

an met a boy her same age in some of her extra-curricular classes. he is not from a well of family, and not a bad guy. i've already talked to the boy's parents and they've agreed to pay something like $300 a month if an decides to keep the baby. that covers two thirds of a reputable daycare for 7 hours a day. we've all agreed that it's next level idiotic to have them marry each other (that seems to be the *way to go* in my country whenever someone impregnates another someone).

**what i'm planning to do**

i plan on taking the money being used towards her education and use part of it towards child support. per month, i pay the equivalent of 1100 towards her hs (the best one in the country). her dad has the means to either pay a not so high-end private hs, but definitely a decent one. i also plan on use the money i've been saving for her university in things like my retirement. i have not made an ultimatum towards her. my plan is to tell her that due to her having a child, i'll use the money that used to go to her education towards the unborn being. if she keeps the baby i will not pay for any private university. i firmly believe bio mom needs to step up.

my husband is telling me i need to understand the situation. i do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill i will die on. i can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and some of the future child's expenses too, but i feel like i'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something i shouldn't. husband firmly believes i am doing this to punish an, but i don't feel so because i'd still be giving her for child support. it's not like i'm leaving her in the streets. **how do i make him understand my reasoning? i truly don't want to be the evil step mother who has no heart and ""cut the step daughter out"", and i also believe he is thinking viscerally with what's the best for his child as he did not experience the teen mom hardships. i want him to understand why i'm not planning to give her everything in a silver plate,** even if i could make an extra sacrifice for paying child support and fancy hs.

**what is happening at the moment.**

i laid some facts down to an, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. i recommended she terminated the pregnancy. an is unsure, and in my heart i believe she does want to terminate, but... her mom is ecstatic and so is her grandma. they have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". i think they're absolute loonies; i bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. i believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

**i want an to understand that what she did was a mistake, that i love her and that i am not punishing her, but that it is not within my reach for us to live comfortably, pay for a fancy school that she will not be able to take fully advantage of, and have a step grandchild at the age of 31.** how do i make a teen feel all that without fucking our relationship? she is a nice kid, but takes after some of her mom's bad traits, such as feeling any type of advice is an attack or every consequence is a punishment.

i truly believe the right way is for her to terminate, not give up for adoption or raise it herself. i do not want to force her to terminate, but i do want her to see where i'm coming from. i also don't want this to fuck over my marriage, i believe dad is hot headed right now. he is disappointed in an, but he's also disappointed in me because he thinks i'm not giving my fullest as i usually do.

**tl;dr: step-daughter got pregnant due to some belief her dead-beat bio mother gave her. i am the one who pays for her tuition but am planning on stopping that in order to give it for child support if she decides to keep it. i could do both, but i feel that's not my baggage. how do i make my husband understand this? how do i break the news to an without it sounding like an ultimatum of ""abort or i'll stop paying school""?**",7

"because i completely lost it with a lady who tried to cut in front of me twice at a large grocery store?. i was at a large grocery store yesterday and i walked up to the butcher area to ask for assistance but there was one person ahead of me. when the person finished, i was just about to ask the butcher my question when a woman cut in front of me and asked him, ""hi, can you please help me in the freezer aisle?"" the butcher said ""yes"" and was about to follow her when i interjected, ""sir, i was here first."" i swear i saw an eye roll on his part but whatever.

moving on. i had a cart full of groceries and i stood in line to check out. there was a woman who was unloading her packed cart in front of me so i waited a few feet behind her because had i moved my cart forward, i would have been blocking the traffic for other customers to walk through. then, i see the same woman, who cut me off in the butcher station, nonchalantly walk in front of me and then she proceeded to unload her items onto the conveyor belt. i told her, ""excuse me, ma'am, i've been waiting here. i'm next in line."" she gave me a smug look and said, ""ha, if you're next, then why are you standing back there and not here??"" so i told her, ""because i don't want to block the flow of traffic walking by but i am next.""

guys, she continued to argue with me saying, ""well....you should've moved forward"" and then continued to unload her groceries. keep in mind that i am not a confrontational person. in my 44 years on this planet, i have never been in a fist fight, in fact, i used to be a major pushover. if i was 18, i may have told her, ""you're right, go ahead."" well, that's not what happened.

i. saw. red. i yelled at her, ""listen lady, i'm a civilized person who takes others into consideration, unlike you who probably doesn't give a shit would've blocked this entire area. now put your things back into your cart now or i'm going to go over there and do it for you!"" then, the kind lady that was originally in front of me, and had finally completed her transaction, took one look at her and said, ""seriously? you need to move because she has been waiting."" you'd think that she would have backed off? nope. she continued to unload her groceries muttering that i should've been closer and not standing so far in the back.

i yelled, ""i'm not going to tell you again. get your shit and put it back into your basket or i'll go and do it myself. now."" she then took a good look at me and started putting her things back in her cart and walked away. i would imagine that by this point, my eyes were crossing and my head was two seconds from spinning like the kid from the exorcist. i can't remember the last time i've felt so angry.

she finally moved but she kept staring me down and i'm ashamed to tell you guys that i screamed ""what the f\*\*k are you looking at????????"" she finally looked away and as quick as this started, it ended. the nice lady that was in front of me patted me on my back and told me that she was impressed how i defended myself but to please calm down because i looked like i was about to pass out.

i need to add that since the store was so packed and music was blaring, not many people witnessed what went down.  only those within hearing range were able to witness this exchange.  i know....  no excuses.

to be honest, at this point in my life, i've let people walk all over me. if this had happened ten years ago, i would've let her go on ahead of me. not now. i'm a jaded, middle aged woman who is not the one. don't get me wrong, what came out of me yesterday felt like an out of body experience. i'm not a mean person. she just sparked something in me that threw me over the edge.

edit: this may or may not be relevant, but i'm a mexican american and all of this occurred in spanish. i am a fluent bilingual speaker but i usually speak english. i didn't even know that i could fight the way i did in spanish. believe me, if you guys knew how to speak spanish, i would've written the exact exchange i had with this entitled twit in spanish. i don't know why but when arguments happen in spanish, it looks like a much bigger deal!! ha!

edit:  i'm getting some flack from some who are calling me an asshole because i assumed that there wasn't a single person here that could speak or read in spanish.  i know a lot of you can so  i translated this story into spanish so it's somewhere within this thread.

"currently the biggest social mistake my generation has made is the way we treat boys.. hello r/unpopularopinion,

every generation has that one thing that they look back on and kind of say ""whoops"" that was a big problem that we didn't see/ we didn't do anything about. i think that thing is how we have treated boys in my generation (late millennial's). i think the writing has been on the wall for a while but nothing seems to happen. i of course mean socially not all of the pollution and terrible way we treat the planet. let me elaborate.

i believe we live in a reactionary society i.e a kid gets hit in a street and the city decides to build a massive speed bump to overcompensate for the issue. applying this to how women were treated previously and you kind of get the idea.  i believe a good portion of our issues plaguing our society ( in the us. mental health, gun violence in schools, suicide, homelessness, drug addiction etc..) currently can be traced back to the difference in how boys/men are treated.  boys from a very young age are told their lives are worth less than their female counterparts, they are taught to hold in their emotions not to talk about the issues plaguing them leading to mental health issues, going to war and dying in another country is virtuous, they should hold women on a pedestal etc..

i mean all the statistics look really bad.

1. men/boys are way more prone to suicide ( yes i know girls are more likely to attempt but boys are 3 times as likely to follow through)
2. graduating college at a much lower rate than women (in the us)
3. ridiculously high incarceration rates and longer sentences compared to women for the same crime.
4. you are ridiculously more like to be a drug addict/ homeless.
5. literally some states have zero domestic violence shelters that will allow men in…. (seriously they won't allow men in but will allow dogs.)
6. very little paternity rights compared to women.
7. and one of the worst things is not being able to talk about any of these issues for fear as being seen as weak

&#x200b;

this all kind of stemmed from me recently talking to my dad and discussing why i was raised so different than my 2 sisters not really mad or anything more just curious as i always had harsher punishments/more chores/ less acknowledgement and overall was probably less involved in my family then my sisters. he said something along the lines of ""i know it wasn't right and wasn't fair but no one gives a shit about a man and me and your mother decided we needed to prepare you for that inevitability of life."" i'm not mad or angry in fact in some ways it probably helped me as i am pretty successful right now and happy but it still got me thinking, i'm sure a lot of men were raised similarly.

&#x200b;

i am not really a men's right activist or anything or a women hater ( i am currently in a very happy 3 year relationship with my girlfriend)  but the more i grow up the more i see issues in how i was raised and how society perceives men and how that leads to a bunch of issues we are currently facing in society. just my 2 cents.",6
"am i (22m) a ""bad guy"" for breaking up with my gf (23f) after she tried to commit suicide.. i don't know whether i'm writing this to get more opinions on how i handled the situation or if i'm just looking validation on my decisions.

my gf and i have been together for nearly 2 years. we've had our problems and good times just like any other couple will, except she's constantly had to deal with her mental health declining and improving constantly. i've been through multiple self-harm attempts, mental breakdowns and suicide attempts, but recently this was the straw that broke the camel's back.

i lost my job last tuesday, and the next day i was home with gf (we share an apartment). the morning started off really well with us joking with each other and laughing at ridiculous posts on facebook. i spent the next 2 hours job hunting online and when it was time for my gf to go to work i went over to talk with her and saw she was taking her anxiety meds. or so i thought. she took a big pinch of pills and swallowed them right as i was sitting down to talk to her. it didn't really click for half a minute or so before i realized just how many pills she was taking. i confronted her and asked how many she took and after a brief back and forth she threw an empty pill bottle towards me. the medicine she took was nearly full with 29 pills that she ingested.

i freak out and tell her she has to throw up right now and she refuses and breaks down. after another short fight i call her father and tell him what's going on and he tells me to essentially call the police if she won't go. i absolutely break down and plead with her to go to the hospital with me. she finally does and we make it to the parking lot where she finally throws up multiple times. long story short, we get her into a room and she is given an iv and is doing fine now. her parents showed up 2 hours later (due to distance) and she is now in a behavioral management unit and is being monitored in the hospital. for the next day after i wasnt able to process anything. nobody checked up on me, which is mainly my fault because i told everyone i was okay, and the day went by in a blur.

this brings me to thursday. i went to visit my gf with her sister in the hospital and during the visit my gf got mad at me for asking my aunt for advice on the situation. i walk out visibly upset and go to sit in my car. my gf calls me and asks if i'm going to leave her, and after a short pause i say yes. it was probably the hardest thing i've had to do in a long time and i felt like such a dick for doing it at a time like this when i knew she was at her lowest point, but i realized that i couldnt do it anymore and that she was being monitored for now so she couldnt do anything drastic and would be able to talk about it to the provided therapists at the hospital. i called her parents right after and absolutely broke down. i haven't cried that hard since my mom died and no matter how hard i tried i couldnt stop crying. i walked back into the hospital afterwards to talk to her and finally let her know that i'd be leaving and moving out. she begged me to stay and reconsider, but there's absolutely no way we can make it work right now. she needs to improve herself and work on her mental health before i could even try to be with her again.

it's hard. it's so fucking hard to walk away from everything. i love her family, our apartment, and most importantly, her. i'm not ready to be alone again. i'm not ready to not have someone to hold on the night's when it gets really hard to see the light. i'm moving back to my home town to be around family and friends, but theres so much to do and i don't know where to go from here. i dont even know what i'm hoping to gain from this post. any advice i can get would be greatly appreciated. even if you don't have anything to add, thanks for taking the time to read this. i wouldn't wish this shit on my worst enemy.

"by looking at my uncle's face at his funeral. so this happened when i was about 13. it was 2am in october when my mom got a call that my uncle had passed away. when i awoke the next morning to my very concerned looking parents sitting on the edge of my bed, i knew someone had died. my mom broke down and told me it was my uncle. i cried but i wasn't terribly close to him although we were far from strangers. i packed my things and we flew to california and for the next 2 weeks we remained by my distressed grandmother's side. 

when andy died (name change for obvious reasons) everyone was alerted but many weren't told how he died until the whole family was together, i was one of those who was left in the dark. when we arrived in california that day we drove to my great grandmothers house and everyone had gathered and there was hushed conversations and hugging and crying. i was very confused because it had now been hours and no one had told me how andy had passed. my mom and grandma, after much pestering, brought me out back and told me the news. andy had shot himself out in the bay and his body was discovered in a boat when his truck was reported for over night parking in a public space (i believe that's how they found him, i'm still a little fuzzy on the details). i didn't really process this until much later and soon you'll know why. 

while attending andy's funeral only immediate family were allowed to see his body, due to the shape he was in and his sustained injuries. that included my grandmother, mom, grandfather, and me. i think maybe one other person was allowed in but he was kept in a separate room from the rest of the family and covered in sheet. you could only see his arms and hands which were crossed over his chest. everyone took their time with him and finally we all went to the service. i heard my mother saying she wanted to see what his face looked like after the gunshot but the funeral director told her something along the lines of ""i can't stop you but i truly and honestly hope you don't look. you want to remember him how he was"". i was in complete shock and i distinctly remember wanting to see him. as a child i needed to see my uncle andy again and i wanted to see his face. 

i had not processed this or thought it through whatsoever so by the time i had excused myself from the service to go to the bathroom and while i was sneaking into the back room i just wanted to see my uncle.

i'm not gonna draw this out. you don't need to know what was under that sheet. andy wasn't there. just burnt cheeks and a hole on the top of his head. i remember being very calm and putting the sheet back and going to sit back with my mom. i didn't cry until about a month later in class when someone was joking about suicide for a class project and continued to laugh while saying ""there are many ways to commit suicide. there's hanging, slitting your wrists, shooting yourself"" etc. it hit me like a ton of bricks and i lost it. i've since seen a therapist for this and i'm a healthy a well adapted adult but this is a tale of caution for everyone out there. when someone you love kills themselves and a funeral director tells you it's better you remember them the way they are, fucking listen to them. it's not worth it, trust me.

**tl;dr while attending my uncle's funeral i looked at his face (it was a closed casket situation/he shot himself). fucked me up for years.**

**edit:** poorly worded tl;dr

**update:** wow! i can't believe how much traction this gained. thank you so much everyone for all your kind words and i'm sorry for everyone who has lost someone and i hope you are all finding comfort in knowing that you're not alone. big thank you to whoever gave me gold! i want my story to be a cautionary tale and i'll try to get through all the comments if i can.

"update: should i (23f) tell my boyfriend (26m) about the egg?. hey guys! 3 months ago i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bflbwz/should_i_23f_tell_my_boyfriend_26m_about_the_egg/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). the tldr of it is my so and i hid easter eggs for each other, and the day before i spotted the giant egg. it was the night before easter, and i wanted to make a light hearted post inquiring about whether or not i should tell him i spotted it. well, it blew up. some weren't happy that it wasn't an unhappy post, but many wanted an update. 

easter wasn't a proposal... but he proposed late last night!! i got home from a long 8 hour drive. he sat me on the couch and wanted to show me a music video he ""helped a friend make"". it was silly, but it was his cover of ""when words fail"" from *the shrek musical*. it's his favorite musical of all time, and when the relationship was first getting started, i learned one of the duets to surprise him with. it's very cute that he picked the musical, because the song does fit, he's funny, and we're immature together like that. as the video ended, he suddenly got up and sang the rest to me and pulled the ring out of his pocket. 

he made the ring(http://imgur.com/a/2m5l1gx) himself with a fire opal, and while it isn't from some fancy big name store, i told him from the very beginning that i don't care how much he spends or doesn't spend. he's not a master jeweler, it was his first (and probably only) ring he will ever make, but it's perfect in every way to me. it symbolizes our love, because he worked so hard on it and it's so very *him*. i love the ring. i love him. i'm nervous to get married because i'm awkward when i'm the center of attention, but i can't wait to be his wife. 

so of course, i accepted! he caught the entire thing on video, but i haven't decided if i want to doxx myself by sharing it here.  i'm also not sure if the mods will allow that? 

so, there it is! the final update! thank you all for the love and positivity 3 months ago, i hope we can keep all that kindness going for everyone here in the sub!",7
"update my 27m girlfriend 25f of two years doesn't know i speak her native tongue.  original(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/99pv4s/my_27m_girlfriend_25f_of_two_years_doesnt_know_i/?st=jmwra7z2&sh=d6d4a2bf) 

a lot of people thought the last story was fake. one of the common themes was that i learned the language too quickly. it is very possible to reach past a1 level in a language (being able to have a basic conversation) at around 3 months. also, i am fluent in another language other than english that has a lot of similarities with german. the combination of the two made learning it much simpler. and i am going to continue improving in the language as it's become a hobby at this point. 

anyway my life has took a complete 180. i was planning on never going on this account again, but i'm feeling better about everything and i hate when other people don't update so...

she did cheat unfortunately. 

i struggled with mental health for a large part of my life. i had suicidal tendencies ever since my first memories starting from the age of 5. my anxiety and depression continued to get worse but i never told anyone, and i know i hid it very well. this was a mistake. eventually, i think i suppressed a lot of these memories and these feelings started becoming more sparse. my mental health has been good for a while before this happened.

we were still at the resort at this point. i should've waited until we were back home probably but i couldn't wait. we had two days left at the resort before coming home. as some users have mentioned i asked her about the situation in english. and if she lied i planned on speaking to her in german. i just asked her who was that guy. but she didn't lie. after about 10 seconds of stuttering she burst into tears and left. again, the same feeling came upon me after she left. i felt like i was a spectator looking into my life and i had no control over my actions. i felt like i had so many emotions and no emotions going on at the same time. about half an hour later she texted me a very long message about every detail, everything that happened, and she apologized. i never answered. 

the short version of what happened:
basically she went for a night time walk one night because she couldn't sleep while i was asleep early one night (we both do this often so i believe it). she ended up coming across some show thing they had going on in the resort and met some random people who were all drinking. they happened to be german. she decided to drink with them to have some fun, and ended up going back to that guy's room. she ended up really connecting with the guy aside from just sex. they exchanged numbers and were texting often when we were there. she felt horrible but she was confused. that's the gist. 

i'm trying to think objectively here and if she really likes this guy, as much as it hurts me, i always stress that people should do what they want and focus on their happiness first. he was also really damn handsome, i was too emotional to admit that in the last post. 

but i was not able to keep a straight mind after she left initially. i never had a reason to be angry before in my life, i know i have a temper but it usually takes a lot to get me even irritated. the feelings i had and the thoughts i had were so horrible that i don't feel comfortable typing it out. it was so hard to keep it in and i lost the ability to focus on reality. when i saw her the next time she wanted to talk to me and apologize in person but i felt like i didn't have the energy to say a word. i avoided speaking to her for the remaining days. i was trying my best to avoid my family but when i saw them i think i must've been acting weird because they clearly knew something was off. it was all very awkward going back on the plane, and not telling my family anything when it must've been so obvious something was off. i sat next to her on the plane. which was so weird. at least she respected the fact that i didn't want to talk. she continued trying to talk and text me when we landed here and there. but at that point i never wanted to see or hear from her again so i blocked her from everything. 

when i came back i was acting very impulsively that entire week. my semester was about to start, but i quickly canceled all my classes and decided to take this semester off. i booked a vacation to a place i've always wanted to go to last minute. i bought a lot of random shit i don't need. i did some semi-hard drugs that i never imagined myself doing before. i had sex with multiple hookers. i got into fights with random guys at bars. i actually felt very good. i woke up every day feeling like i was on top of a mountain. but i came to my senses over a week after i came back from the resort. there was a stereotypical-cliche-movie-moment instant where i was puking in a club bathroom with that heartbeat music sound. i started laughing and realizing how i was fucking up my life. so i decided to see a therapist. who then referred me to a psychiatrist (i guess i'm crazy). and i was diagnosed with bpd with bipolar 2. i've never heard of bpd before, but after reading into it i felt like a lot of the symptoms were things i've struggled with since i was very young. i guess this ""trauma"" really made the symptoms set off even worse. 

today, i still have this semester off. i am continuing treatment and will probably start medication soon. i still haven't spoken to grace. she contacted my sister but i didn't wanna hear what she had to say. i've been kind of avoiding my family and close friends, and i should stop that. i think i learned a lot about myself and definitely learned that i am not ready for a relationship. this was a wake up call. the anger and sadness has mitigated and i feel like myself again. i don't think anything else will happen so i won't be on the account anymore. thanks for all the advice, i apologize for not answering anyone i just really didn't want to talk to anyone. but i read everything. and thanks for the pms too. 

tl;dr: unfortunately she did cheat. i went nuts and started ruining my life with impulsive behavior. stopped myself before it got to bad. went to a psychiatrist. working on my mental health. feeling better now.

"by smoking a joint.. so i'm literally writing this about 30 minutes after it happened,

so this morning i'm thinking i'm going to smoke a small joint before i go into work to deal some minor stress (dad just had a heart attack this morning) so i'm running late thanks to the awful choice to smoke a joint, as i realise i wasn't going to get to the train station in time i spent £10 on a taxi there,

so i get to the train station and buy my ticket (£6.80) and jump on the train ready to not be late for work!

so what happens? because i'm so fucking baked i leave my ticket and the receipt on the train... get to the barriers and i can't find the bloody thing, at which point i ask an attendant if i'm able to re buy my ticket and he tells me ""yes but you're going to have to pay a £20 fine for traveling without a ticket as well"" as annoying as this is i can't do much but agree, so i pay, now my journey is at £33.60 so far, i then ask if i can have my ticket so i can return back from work later and i'm told ""no you will have to buy another one"" 

so after this costly shitstorm of a travel fare i get into work and explain my shitty morning to my manager and that i'm going to need to take tomorrow off to see my dad in hospital,

i then find out that i have booked today and tomorrow off about 2 weeks ago.

"update: received open-ended proposition from female co-worker recently, seriously considering accepting. original post here.(http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1i6fde/received_openended_proposition_from_female/) wanted to say thanks to all who commented, and for the good advice from many. made me think hard. on sunday, i showed my wife the note and told her i was going to ask to be assigned to work with someone else, and asked her opinion about any other steps i should take. she started crying and hugged me, said she always was suspicious of my colleague, had sensed that she was attracted to me and had been somewhat worried, even suspicious of me a few times (for which she apologized). we ended up talking about it for several hours, and it was wonderful to clear the air with her and get this load off my shoulders.

yesterday, i asked my colleague to go to coffee with me. i handed her the note back and told her i could not do such a thing, even though i had been briefly tempted. then i told her i thought it would be best if we mutually sought to be reassigned. i told her (at my wife's suggestion) that i had spoken to my wife about the issue, and that she had suggested i photocopy the note and take it to hr, but that i didn't want to go that route, and would rather that we both came out of this okay with our jobs intact. (left hanging was the implication that i probably had made a copy of the note, and that since my wife knew, i had backup should any shit later hit the fan.) she was fighting back tears at this point and kept apologizing for putting me in this position, and said she would do whatever i thought was best. so we worked it out that we would both approach our boss together and say that, while we were happy with our work to date, we were both looking for new challenges and, perhaps, new team members. that meeting is planned for tomorrow, and i believe the boss (who is a very smart woman) will get the message and reassign us both without prejudice.

once again, thanks for the good advice, redditors. if there's interest, i will post a follow-up to tomorrow's meeting.

**edit: thanks for all the nice comments, i feel a little overwhelmed. a couple of you raise good points which i want to address.**

**-- yes, i did tell my wife that i had been tempted, and i apologized for not immediately sending the note back. she said yes, i should have done that, but that she understood. (she has met my colleague several times in business settings, and has commented more than once that she is very attractive and is surprised she's still single.)**

**-- clearly, i should have immediately turned down the offer. i never considered myself someone who would stray. i was (in retrospect) kind of obnoxiously proud of the image i had of myself as a good man and husband. that image is now quite different. this has been a wake-up call and i have been doing much more soul-searching than i care to detail.**

**-- looking back at my posts, i have cast my colleague in a one-dimensional light. she is a good person, a very good person. she has been an excellent colleague and everyone we work with has nothing but praise for her. the chemistry between us was almost immediately apparent but i chalked it up to us having very similar backgrounds and outlooks on the best way to get things done. but looking back, i have to be honest in saying that what i thought was just collegiality on my part could have been construed as flirting, and i have to take my share of the blame for that. if she made a mistake in being tempted and sending that note, i made one in not turning her down immediately and in involving other people that would have been better uninvolved.**",11
"it's the end of the year, time to remember those credit cards you have in a drawer!. i make this post once a year, around the christmas/new year's eve time.

as most of us know, keeping your credit history as long as possible is very good for our credit scores. the more lines of credit we have open, the more it affects our average age of credit, total amount of credit available, and just in general credit score goodness. 

that being said, it's time to think of the credit lines we have open just to keep the average age of credit up. those cards that you have stuck in a drawer because they have no annual fee, but don't give decent enough rewards to be used on a regular basis.

it's that time now! pull those cards out and buy a value meal at a mcdonalds. maybe a coffee at starbucks. hell, use them to buy a tank of gas for your car. 

if you have enough monthly charges, put each card with one of them. insurance on one, netflix on another, etc. then set up auto-payment so you don't need to even think about them.

the important cards are the ones that may get canceled because of non-usage. those are the ones that you want to do anything with this year. spend something on them, then immediately go pay them off. just like always, you don't need to pay interest to keep your credit score up. 

happy new year my pf friends!",10

"by trying to hallucinate. this story happened years ago, back when i was a weird 14 year old kid. 

i had always been interested in psychology and at the time came across articles about hallucinations, which resulted in a brief obsession with the topic. eventually, i really wanted to experience hallucinations myself, of course without having to take drugs or doing anything harmful. 

so, i googled away. goldmine: i found a step-by-step guide on how to induce hallucinations:

*1. cover each eye with half a ping pong ball*

*2. make sure that the room is dark and have a red light in front of you to look into.*

*3. use noise canceling headphones and listen to static*

*4. wait around looking like a maniac and eventually (hopefully) hallucinate*



naturally, this wasn't something that i intended on doing with other people in the house. i patiently waited for an opportunity to be home alone and put my master plan into action:

i stole one of my brothers ping pong balls and cut it in half, took my mother's infrared lamp and darkened out my room. within a short amount of time, i was ready. 

now, imagine a kid sitting completely still on a chair with ping pong balls glued over their eyes, wearing headphones and staring into an infrared lamp in complete darkness.  yep - it's as weird as it sounds. 

i cant put into words how excited i was to experience hallucinations first-hand and completely lost track of time. but alas! my waiting paid off, when i began to faintly hear footsteps, something that the guide explained was a common first auditory hallucination. my journey into a heightened state of mind was finally taking course! ... or so i thought. 

turns out that in the meantime, my parents and brother had come back home. my mom noticed the odd red light shining under my closed door and checked up on me, only to find me like... *that*. 

after getting over the initial shock, she called over the other family members to come take look at me, while i was sitting there blissfully unaware and pumped about finally 'hallucinating'. of course they didn't pass up on the chance to take a couple of photos of me, before tapping  my shoulder and asking me *what the fuck* i was doing. 

you can imagine my horror when i realized that the tap on my shoulder wasn't a hallucination, but real. 

the aftermath was that i had to buy my brother new ping pong balls and that i became the laughing stock of my family for a while, resulting in an embarrassing story that my parents still like to bring up occasionally. and of course, the pictures were shown around as well, causing immense embarrassment on my part. 

and arguably the saddest part of the story is that i never wound up hallucinating as i had originally planned. 

**tl;dr : i glued ping pong balls over my eyes, listened to static and sat in complete darkness while staring into res light in an attempt to hallucinate - got caught by my family and ended up completely embarrassed**

"masturbation / jerking off is and should be a profession sport and in the olympics. hear me out here - this sport isn't like the other sports. it would test the durability, patience, and strength of a man. nobody realizes how tough it is to jerk off for 10 straight minutes without busting a nut. that's why we should have the absolute professionals all do it in one place on tv. i don't think it would be nsfw, we can just keep the camera on the pools of cum on the ground.  jerking off is a very tough test and requires a lot of concentration, and i have plenty of ideas for this.

**name**

professional jerking / jerking

**how the game is played**
i think professional jerking can have many different concepts, so let's just set this is for the *olympics*.  we bring 50 of the worlds best masturbaters, and bring them into the arena. think about it, the lights and sounds, the chants, as we prepare for the first profession jerking. 

we start with round 1, the players get to chose what they want to watch and the clock stars 20 minutes down, every player has to jerk with condiments of there choice. last one to nut wins. first five to nut are eliminated. then, we do it again with a 20 minute break for advertisements and to regenerate nut power, as we go on to round 2. 

we repeat the process over and over, until we reach a final 5. last one standing. now they have to jerk to each other. *first* to nut wins. as they watch their same gender opponents and try as hard as possible to jerk to their sweaty, white dicks, with how gay it is, they have to bust. first one to cum wins.

*league*
it's be call the pjl.- professional jerking league, and the league subreddit would be r/professionaljerking.

that is all. i have a dream that this could happen  one day. sorry in advance for any formatting issues i'm on mobile

update to this post here.(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ceccoj/my_friend_m25_is_being_stalked_and_no_one_not/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app)

following much of the advice offered, i managed to get a handful of pictures and videos. cost me a couple bucks but it was worth it to prove i wasn't imagining things. rather than go to the police, i opted to show my buddy. at first he was in denial (laughing it off as nonsense) until he noticed that the oldest picture i took was three days ago. he asked me if i had actually noticed her for a while now and i told him yes.

he seemed pretty overwhelmed, though he did apologize for doubting me. he says he'll think about what to do before we head off to work (neglected to mention that we work at the same place and live in the same apartment complex which is why i've noticed her a lot; sorry for the lack of forethought). he genuinely acts surprised, maybe a bit afraid. i'm wondering if i should take this to the police.

i'll post updates when they come, but i'm just glad he doesn't think that i need to be admitted to a psych ward and that he apologized.

a1) it's a fair question. honestly, i thought it was me at first but then i started traveling alone, watching myself. either she's only following me when i'm with my friend or it's my friend who's being followed.

q2) is my friend in a relationship or legal troubles?

a2) no and no, as far as i know. unless he's venting he does t talk about financial or legal troubles and he's still recovering from a break-up three months ago. and he's gay.

q3) does he recognize her?

a3) if he does, he didn't say anything to me.

q4) do you do pranks often?

a4) he's one of those people who likes being serious but appreciates a good joke, but this is something neither of us would want.

q5) consider hiring a pi.

a5) tempting, and i will bring that option up if necessary.

q6) show us pictures.

a6) as much as i'd like to, i feel as though the sensitivity and uncertainty of the situation calls for caution. if things get dire enough, i'll consider it. if you doubt me because i refuse to post pictures, then that's you're decision. if you believe me or not doesn't change reality.

q7) is this fake?

a7) i fucking wish. i'd like nothing more than for all of this to be an elaborate hoax or joke that winds up me being the punchline.

we've decided to go to the police department after we get off work. we both work at the university fyi. more updates will follow afterwards.

i would like to thank everyone for their concern and support. the matter has been resolved, and things are relatively returning back to normal. as far as i'm concerned, this just means i'll be able to finally get a decent night's sleep. thank you and have a wonderful day.

sorry for the awful update.l, work is getting a bit hectic, as well as everything else since i'm going on a two week vacation soon with my family. so we secured a police car to watch over the complex until morning, which we then followed our usual routine. the lady returned once again and was finally apprehended. i'm not sure what will follow but i'll try to keep everyone posted in the next week or so.",7

"update i 34m recently found out that my s/o 32f had sex with another guy immediately before our first date. this made me feel really upset, and i can't quite pinpoint what i should do.. hello everyone! here was my previous post:

https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/9fp53u/i_34m_recently_found_out_that_my_so_32f_had_sex/

so, it has been about two weeks since i learned about what happened before our first date. she and another man had sex immediately before i picked her up, and something about it irked me.

while the last post was full of people just in it to mock me, a few users did post very helpful advice. another user sent me some private messages telling me how i can get over the issue.

one thing that really resounded true with me was that i was strongly thinking about how *i* felt about the situation, but not about how *she* felt. there wasn't exactly a wedding ring on her finger when she had sex with the other man. at no point in time do i have claim over her body and her choices, especially not when we weren't even in a committed relationship yet.

i talked with her about the issue and how she felt about it, and at first she was hesitant, but eventually she opened up and told me that she was looking for some sort of connection. to be honest i felt really sad that she hadn't given me a chance to fill that role for her (not even on a physical but emotional level) before calling some guy from tinder over, but i feel like i understand her better now. more than anything, i realized the pressing need for me to come to terms with my own issues, and the social conditioning i've had that made me borderline shame her for having sex. if she felt good, and if he felt good about the encounter, calling myself a victim for it is ridiculous and entitled.

right now i'm looking through therapists in my area to see if i can't take a more proactive approach to my personal issues.

thank you all for the helpful advice, even those of you who laughed at me. for anyone who cares, i'm working through it and things are looking up!

**tl;dr: i've decided to work on myself instead of concentrating so much on my s/o's behavior before we were even committed.**",7

"my boyfriend expressed his rape fantasies after sleeping with me for the first time.. long time anon lurker, first time poster. i'm so utterly dumbfounded that i have no idea who to turn to.

up until last night, i (21f) was a virgin. a late bloomer, i guess; i never had the time nor confidence to fool with it. i met my boyfriend (22m) seven months ago after signing up to my university's sign language society. we settled into a relationship about two months following that, so it was probably a little hasty in hindsight.

things had been fine, and i'f been rendered utterly smitten. he's charming, well-kempt, and has been nothing short of understanding of my inexperience.

last night, however, things took a really sharp turn. an evening spent on the wine had made us both a little comfortable and we went to bed together. i was initially happy to do so as everything leading up to that point had me convinced that he'd be gentle and thoughtful about it, but he wasn't. i was manhandled, pushed down, and he would insult me occasionally throughout the whole ordeal. i was tipsy and hurting, and at one point he even kept me held to the sheets by my neck when i tried to sit up. when he'd done, he left me until i'd almost fallen asleep, before rejoining me in bed. it hurt throughout the night, and i'm still really sore almost a full day later.

when i sobered up this morning, i asked him what went so wrong when he joined me in the dorm kitchen to get some water. he played it as though everything was fine, but i told him that i didn't feel fine. it's hard to pin how the conversation led, but he basically told me that one of his deepest fantasies was - in his words - ""defloration and conquest."" i was undeniably disturbed and basically blurted out the term rape fantasy. he got irate over this and described it as consensual non-consent. i became upset and removed myself from the kitchen when i heard my flatmate's door open, and i'm not sure what he did with himself following that.

i've not left my room since, and i've had an absolute flurry of messages from him that i can't bring myself to open. i feel dirty, and hurt, and stupid, and can't help but feel like i've been groomed as an object of this fucked fantasy of his.

i don't know where to go from here, or who to turn to. i'm desperately tempted to ghost him and just be done with it, but we each attend the same campus and its sign language class, of which i will likely quit.

i don't know if i'm overreacting and being too hard on him. i don't know if this is something i should raise, and if so, who to? i'm feeling god awfully irrational at this moment and wasn't sure where to express this, so here i am.

any advice would be hugely appreciated.",7
"what do you say when a job interview asks what you expect your starting rate/salary to be?. i've had this question for a few job interviews now, and i never know what the appropriate answer is. what do you say when a company asks what you expect your own rate to be? minimum wage? minimum wage+x?",10
"my dad died and left me a fancy condo with no mortgage. and yet, i can't really afford to live here!. my dad passed away and i inherited his fancy 3 bedroom condo with no mortgage that's worth somewhere around $500-600k. he lived just outside a large city in the midwest but i was wanting to move there anyway. so moving in the condo seems like a great idea. but then i find out the taxes are more than $12k per year. the hoa ( assessments) is like $800 per month. that's basically $1800 per month for a fancy condo that's actually larger than i even need. what i actually \*need\* is a smaller apartment... that rents for about $1800 per month. i don't have a steady income right now, so it would seem like i should just sell and use that money to help with rent. the problem is the real estate market is soft right now, and properties aren't selling quickly, and even worse, they don't increase in value the way they do in la or ny. it's basically gone up $50-100k since it was first purchased in 2003 -- and this is a great, gentrified area.

so my question is actually as follows. if renting costs me $1800 per month and owning costs me $1800 per month, is there really any larger benefits to owning in a city where the housing is fairly stagnant?

**edit:** when i mention the option of renting an $1800 apartment, i'm just guessing the cost of a decent one bedroom apartment in this area. it might be a bit less. i might find something great for $1300 but that's probably the bottom and it would be a lucky find.",10
"if numbers can be infinitely large, can they also be infinitely small?. a friend told me the following math problem:  


imagine you are walking to the bus stop. your current position has a value of 1, the bus stop has a value of 0, and the distance between the two can be represented by a decimal. before you reach the bus stop you must first reach half way to the bus stop (0.5), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.25), and then you must reach half way between that point and the bus stop (0.125) and so on and so on, i think you get the picture. if you must first pass an infinite number of places before reaching the bus stop, mathematically how do you actually reach it?

if you continue this process infinitely, simple math would suggest that you will never reach the bus stop, but we know that we can reach it in a real world example. is this because as numbers get very small they must approach a finite value? ",9
"my wife is going to have sex with other men. title says it all. my wife, beth, and i are 50. 3 kids last just graduated and started new job in may. been married 27 years. 2 kids are married the daughter is 5 months pregnant with 1 st grandchild. this past friday family celebrated  beth's 50 th. she was stay at home mom until about 13 years ago. she started a career has done great. we are almost equal in pay. we are not rich, still a mortgage but life is comfortable.

saturday i was finishing my breakfast. she sits down across from me and says""i need to tell you domething"". she pauses. i am like okay what is it? take a deep breath and says ""i am going to start having sex with other men"". i just stare waiting for a smile to crack. none. i ask her to repeat it. she does still no smile. now i am wtf does that mean. she goes on to explain for the last 10 years she has had the pact with herself, the kids will be gone, job is good, our life is good, she wants to do this for herself. again wtf. we were married in our early 20's, only partners, she feels she missed out. now that she is 50 she wants this new life. she wants the marriage opened up. i asked if i had any say. nope. she hoped i would look elsewhere also. she wants to stay married.

now i am going apeshit. i am yelling, crying, sobbing, all the emotions of betrayal. i asked if i did anything to cause this. no all her.  i left the house to drive nowhere. i called her best friend from childhood, clare. she confirmed they had talked about this off and on over the years. they have a group of friends they do their girls night out etc. 2 are single, 4 married. the 2 singles delight the group with their exploits. clare says they all have a yearning but beth is the only one following through. i should point out i will be talking to clares husband, we are good friends.

so i have no one to talk to about this. parents on both sides are alive in their late 70's. i called my brother 1000 miles away. he was blown away, no advice. i did call a  lawyer on monday. will meet next week. in the mean time he advised not to move out, change locks, or change living arrangements as that could come back to bite me. he said take lots if notes, and above all no physical confrontation. that would not be a problem.

sunday i went in for round 2. i asked if she was going to date these guys, no just sex. how were they to meet. a girlfriend was to set her up on sites.  i was worried about her safety. girl friends  would be close by on initial meetup. they would also know where and when the hook up would take place. they would know when and where the hookups take place.

i know there are some weird ass posts on reddit. i need to google half the things people write with all the acronyms,  initials and just plain different lifestyles. has anyone got advice or heard of something like this? i took monday off from work to collect my thoughts but that didn't work. she is just going about her life unfazed by this.",7

"i (21m) got my fwb (33f) pregnant and she's keeping it, i want to talk to her about other options.. this has been really weighing on me for the past couple of days, i'll try to sum it up the best i can.

i'm a 21 year old dude in college. about 8 months ago i met my current fwb at a bar. we had a lot of chemistry and we immediately hit it off, and things escalated from there. 

we've been in this exclusive fwb relationship for half a year already. she's amazing and i really like her a lot. she's gorgeous and incredibly intelligent, i can actually have a good conversation with her. she's 33 and has a very solid job, basically she has her life in order. we see each other roughly 2/3 times a week and it feels like every time it gets better. we're not just there for the benefits, we really enjoy each other's company. we never really dated but that's also partly because of the age gap.

sunday she told me that she's pregnant. with my kid. she's on the pill but got knocked up anyway. she's 7 weeks in already and told me immediately when she found it. she also told me that she's 100% sure she wants to keep it. she says that she's ready to be mom and that it feels like the right time. if i don't want to be involved with the kid she wouldn't mind and she says that she's capable of raising him/her by herself, if i were to choose to not be involved. this news came as a complete shock for me, and i had no clue she would keep baby if she got pregnant. she told me in the past she would probably terminate it if she ever were to get pregnant. it's all so confusing to me.

i'm 21. i don't want a kid right now. but she's going to put one on the world that's ours. i also don't want the kid to grow up without the father, even if she says she can handle it on her own (which i know she could). she wouldn't seek child support from me either, she makes way more than me. i understand that she's carrying a child and that it's not my place to tell her what to do. i do want to ask her if she has considered abortion and if that's still an option. i don't know if i can do this and if i'm ready to be a father. would it be a dick move to ask/tell her what she thinks of abortion?

i'm not saying she should get an abortion or that i think that's the only option. i want her to at least consider it and see it from my side. it's her choice, but i feel like she only focussed on keeping the kid. rightfully so of course, nothing wrong with that. do i just need to live with it? i feel lost.",7

my husband and i have been married 7 years and he has been super duper supportive and loving and encouraging, but he is also on the husky side and the man looooooves his fast food every week or so. 

i have been craving mcdonald's, kfc, all that gorgeous greasy fatty goodness and because my diet is doing so well i put a blanket ban on all fast food in the house. 

at first my man was 100% for it and told me whatever made my life easy but for the last month or so he's been wanting to get fast food and i've told him he's welcome to go eat out or in the car but it's not coming in the house. he's been getting frustrated with me and said it's his house too and he should be allowed to eat kfc without me telling him 'no'. in fairness to him he's respected the rule and i know for a fact he's not snuck it in the house. 

i love him and really do feel bad but my friends are really encouraging and keep telling me he needs to deal with it. am i really a monster? should i just relent and let him get the occasional fast food?

i asked her what was wrong and she said she was having really bad cramps. they must have been really bad, because she said she was going home early.

i consider myself very sympathetic to the female condition, so naturally, i assumed she was just having a rough period. i said, ""well, hey, at least you're not pregnant!"" i laughed at my own comment and patted myself on the back for being such a relatable funny confidant for women.

several months later she told me that her cramps were so severe that day because she had gotten an abortion that morning.

tl;dr told my boss ""at least you're not pregnant"" thinking she was on her period when she had actually just had an abortion that morning.

i like my department except for this one guy. he is all show and no substance. he gets by on his charm. i felt bad for him because he is the office affirmative action hire. we were cool in the beginning, but that changed when i causally mentioned that i was gay. i neither act nor look ""gay."" no one cared that i was gay. all of a sudden, this guy acts uncomfortable around me. i am not even into black guys and i think he feels like everyone who likes penis has to be into him. i ignored it until i found out that he jokes with other guys that they should ask me out on a date. also, he would try to throw me under the bus to cover up his mistakes, doesn't even say ""thank you"" or ""good morning."" when i took a day off to attend my father's funeral, he was the only person in my department who did not sign my condolence card. he does not treat his ""bruhs,"" people with vaginas or his supervisors like that. this would be a non-issue if he did not ask me for so much help to do his job.

"i 48 m don't know how to be a good dad to a child 1 m i never wanted.. so my wife (she's 40 and we've been married for 18 years) and i were vehemently childfree, or so i thought. we've always planned that if an accident did happen and she were to get pregnant she'd have an abortion.

we've talked in the past about a vasectomy, clearly it never happened. we both have a low libido. sex maybe once a month. she had an iud. often we'd still use condoms since it was more cleanly. 

well against all odds my son was created. i pushed for an abortion which she wanted originally. that never came to fruition since she began to have doubts it was the right thing to do. eventually she said she just couldn't go through with it. i don't blame her nor do i feel negatively towards her suddenly wanting to be a mother. afterall is the most natural thing there is, especially once pregnant. i could not fault her. i love her dearly. she knows what she is and isn't capable of and she wasn't capable of abortion.

she has acclimated wonderfully to motherhood, whereas i to fatherhood? not so much. i was planning on retiring in a few years. we were going to travel since we haven't ever done much of it. i've always been fairly busy. i was ready to be done. i've worked hard to put us in a position where this was possible.

now with a child it's really not feasible. that's not the point really. the point is this niggling sense of resentment. the fact that i'll have a teenager in my 60s fills me with dread. the fact that when i look at my son i don't feel love, just an overwhelming sense of responsibility.

i feel horrid saying that, but this isn't the life i wanted nor dreamt of or worked hard for. i don't hate him for it. it is what it is. i'm struggling, however. mentally mostly, i'd say. emotionally i'm a wreck. i think i hide it well.

it's just never ending. he goes goes goes. and screams. he's never satisfied. he's cute when he laughs. he's a spitting image of me. i feel a pull towards him. i wouldn't miss him if he disappeared. i want him to be happy. i'm not happy. how will this ever work?

i'm afraid of failing him and creating some sort of monster. i'm afraid i'll never be enough. i'm afraid i'll never feel content in my own home ever again.  i'd run if i were a lesser man. i'd never leave them without means to care for themselves... but i'd run.

i will never run. he needs more than just money. i don't know how to be more than just a wallet. how do i love him? how do i be everything he needs? how do i not lose myself in the process?

 i hope i'm not an incoherent babbling mess.

"by making people think i'm in an incestuous relationship with my mother (nsfw). so today my mother and i did our weekly shopping. i accompany her most weeks as it's usually the only time we get to spend each other at the moment with our schedules and everything else.

"in my younger years i committed lots of credit card fraud. in my late teens, for a family vacation my dad had rented a minivan.  upon returning home, i went with him to return it to the rental agency at the local airport.  as the serviceperson was closing out the rental, and taking another customer's phone call at the same time, i noticed something written on a sticky note on the counter.

4 groups of 4 digits, then two pairs divided by a slash.

a credit card number!

being this was the late 90s, and the internet as we know it was in its infancy, i was mildly versed in the illicit online antics of the day.  i had copies of the anarchist's cookbook, hacker's handbook, terrorist's handbook (which more than half was just a copy/paste of anarchist's, but i digress), netbus, subseven, all the fun toys that the ""computer nerds"" would use to cause mayhem in their boredom.  and spying on those wonderful digits i knew i could have some fun.

so i pulled out my little sharp wizard (oz-640) that i got as a gift since i had a thing for portable computer devices back then (foresight maybe? lol) and, slowly read each number block upside down and typed it into my little pda, closed the app, saved.

fast forward a week, and while visiting a friend's house i mentioned to her brother that i had swiped a cc number.  being teenagers with access to the internet, we wanted to get so porn.  back in the day, 'adult id' was the go-to people for free porn sites, but you had to have a 'adult id' code to get in.

so........we bought a lifetime pass with the stolen card. $69.99. and our id was muffdive69.

that poor key got around for a few years if you know what i mean.

along with my newfound digital porn pass, i discovered a ""bug"" in the dial-up provider formally known as prodigy online.  apparently they had a two week free trial for anyone who signed up, and after that they would then charge your credit card and continue with your service.

remember how i said i had the anarchist's cookbook?  well in there was a few sets of phony ids and a few fake credit card numbers.  i used those to create a new account every two weeks, and continued to use the stolen card for many other digital services for almost 3 months before the card got flagged and shutdown (because lets be honest, it was safer buying digital codes and keys than buying actual stuff since that stuff has to ship somewhere, and that's how you got busted back in the day)

many years of digital mischief would continue until i settled down (even wireshark'd a comp. science student's university login at a local panera for more free internet. you'd think a cs student would know not to use pop3 over unsecured wifi)

"discover will no longer offer extended product warranty, purchase protection, return guarantee, and auto rental and flight accident insurance benefits as of 2/28/2018. i went to check out my discover card benefit and these two notifications(https://imgur.com/gallery/8ka67) came up. this is really disappointing, as these are great benefits. 

explanation of these benefits:

extended product warranty - additional year of coverage on top of original product warranty 

purchase protection - refund damaged or stolen products up to $500 within 90 days of purchase. 

return guarantee - discover will help you with a product return when the store won't accept it

auto rental insurance - up to $25,000 in rental vehicle insurance 

flight accident insurance - up to $500,000 in coverage 

edit: i see a lot of people saying they are going to cancel their discover card. please feel free to do whatever you want, but keep in mind what doing so may do to your credit. keeping the card open will help increase you average age of accounts (aaoa) and total available credit which in turn affects your credit utilization rate. you don't have to actively use the card, just make a transaction on it every few months or so to keep the account active.

"i'm 21 year old, $17,000 saved up. $6500 of that is in investment portfolio. no debt. need some ideas.... lets break it down. i have around $17,000 to my name and turned 21 in january. i have a full ride scholarship and not a cent of debt.

the specifics:

\- $9000 of cash in my savings

\- $6500 in charles schwab portfolio (6000 initial investment) ($500 gain)

\- $500 in robin hood

\- $250 in coinbase

\- $250 cash

\- $500 school fund

i have a full ride in college and currently going to start my senior year in august. i will come out with no debt. i have a car that works fine and all paid off. i will be receiving about $2000 more in summer from my internship, and will try to find an internship during my fall and spring semester.

my monthly expenses starting in august is roughly $200 for food and cellphone. (i'm very frugal). i will literally go out of my way to save a few bucks here and there if need be. my pell grants and scholarships will pay for my living next year as well. i will have around $1,500 in miscellaneous expenses before senior year. i am an accounting major and will go a fifth year in college, that is paid for as well. i also live in nebraska, so many things are cheap for me.

i need ideas to know what else to do with my cash on hand. i'm tired of watching it sit there. i need some ideas. and will reply as soon as possible if any questions.

p.s. my whole family lives pay check to paycheck, the only reason why i've saved so much is to not turn out like them. thats literally the only thing that keeps me going.

"it's been 7 years now, and i want to share my story with bank of america. first off, if you're lending an ear (or an eye) i want to sincerely thank you. i've told this story so many times when asked about the last 7 years of my life; anything that has had to do with school, loans for school and building my credit/savings. 

april 2009 i started a job at a local chili's bar and grill as a busser. i was 17 years old it was just a side job on the weekends during high school. i was making $2.13/h with added 'tips' from the waiters and waitresses. 

a big thing my dad has always preached to me was to save money, so i decided to open a bank account with bank of america solely because the check that i received from my job came from that bank. 

i remember, very clearly, being brought into an office to set up a 'student' account with them. the representative made sure to explain all the benefits of the account being that i was a student. however, the ironic part about the whole experience was her putting an emphasis on overdraft protection that came with the account, to protect students from incurring fees that they could not afford.  fair enough. that sold me. it seemed as though it was a solid decision at the time so i went through with it. 

about a week in, i used the debit card that came with the checking account i set up to buy something on the net. i can't remember exactly what it was buy i do remember this company double charging me and... low and behold... over-drafting my account by 5 dollars. 

i was only my making so much while working at this job, and it had been apparent to me, at the time, that i was either lied to by this bank representative about 'overdraft protection' or something fell through the cracks. i didn't want any more trouble so i decided to pay the overdraft fee and then close the account. 


then something horrid happens that effects the next 5-6 years of my life, and this is mainly what i'm posting here for:

**as it turns out boa had placed something of a 'credit' lock on my social security**

- preventing me from taking out loans for myself to go to school when it was time.

- opening up any bank accounts at any bank in the country.

- opening any credit cards to establish and grow my credit.

- flagged me as an identity thief on my own name.

besides the slimy legal crap, it looks like i have to go through, i'm here posting this because i'd like to know how do i get out of this rut boa has put my in. i was able to attend school for two years because my grandfather cosigned for me for two years.. but his passing has forced me to leave school and attend community college where i can only go if i pay out of pocket. 

for years i've been working and trying my best to pay these loans, all while putting food in my mouth.. paying my parents (who i live with) rent, and living expenses. but i can only do so much with the 9-10 dollar an hour jobs and i don't know what to do any more.

**tl;dr: bank of america places a sketchy 'ban' on my credit because i closed my bank account after a over-drafting and it has crippled my finances so much, i couldn't finish school and i'm struggling to get by among other things.**

any help is greatly appreciated... thank you!!

i hope this serves as some help by some bizarre consequence it happens to you too!

"is this a scam? yes, more than likely it absolutely is.. i see so many posts in pf every day about is this a scam and if you have to ask the question, it more than likely is. 

i am currently dealing with this at my job and its just a mess.   one day last week our bank noticed a check number well out of sequence had cleared our account and the signature on the check wasn't one of our usual signors.  they contacted us and sure enough, some scammer got a hold of our account info and made new checks.   that was a week ago.  every single day a new check has cleared our account.   my company is not out any money, the next day the check that cleared is reversed and we get our money back.  you know who is getting screwed?  the people that are foolish enough to believe the story the scammer gave them and cash the check.  one guy actually deposited a $4950 check to his account that we saw go through.  he then googled our company, because our actual company name and address is on the check, and found our number and called.   he spoke to the receptionist to ask if it was a real check.  the scammer told him he could have his car wrapped for free and he'd get $500, he just had to take the $4950 check to his bank and deposit it, keep the $500 and send the remainder somewhere.   luckily for him, he thought to call us before he sent anything anywhere and is only going to be out the bounced check fee.    

every single day someone has cashed one of these checks, amounts ranging from $900 to $5,000.  another lady called us yesterday and said she got a check int the mail with a letter to call x number after receiving it.  instead she googled us and called to ask if it was a real check.  no ma'am, it sure isn't.  it seems they are using many different stories and scams with these checks and i think this is probably going to continue until we can finally get that account closed.  our police department can't do anything because the checks are being cashed all over the country and not in their jurisdiction.  they said its up to our bank but i'm not sure how much they are going to do either since none of us are out any money, its just the hassle and manpower to deal with it.  

it amazes me that anyone still falls for this but they absolutely do.  please, if it seems to good to be true, it 10000% is.",10

"by not wiping my bum on the bus.. this happened about 15 minutes ago and i'm still practically doubled over.

so, as with the winter season (well tbh basically every season for me), i've got the common cold, which paired with my asthma makes me a joy to be around on the bus.

for a bit of background, my nose and sinuses are pretty solidly packed, my nose streams like a tap, and my voice keeps breaking because of the phlegm in my throat.

anyway, i get a bus to work in the morning because i can't drive (currently learning to) and it's packed with the usual odd squad and gawkers. so, i step on the bus, swipe my pass, and go and sit down on the bottom level (double decker bus), and pull my phone out to join the internet for the day.

i realise about 5 minutes into the journey that my nose has started leaking, as it's dripping on my phone screen, so i lean over and reach into my back pocket where i keep loose tissues. i'm practically rubbing my back pocket for 5 minutes trying to get these tissues out, but they're caught between my coat and my belt, which is forcing them down the back of my trousers.

i realise that people have started looking over at me, leant over with my hand full of tissue down the back of my pants, looking strained and ill.

to avoid any confusion on this journey, i thought i'd better clear up with the rest of the bus that my hand was just caught and that i wasn't consciously shaking a hand full of tissues around my arse.

i decide to clear up the matter with this cracker, which wasn't helped by my frustrated cracking voice:

""i'm not wiping my bum""

this is met with complete silence.

realising what i've just said, my childish sense of humour kicks in and i start laughing and chuckling - to the point where the streaming nose i had, had emptied itself all over my shirt leaving me looking like a glazed krispy kreme donut.

i'm currently typing this from the taxi i've had to take home to get changed, which is going to make me an hour and a half late for work.

i still have to explain this to my boss.

tldr: got on a bus with a cold, tried to pull tissues out of my back pocket and inadvertently looked like i was caught wiping, and decided to let the bus know that i specifically wasn't wiping my bum. laughed hard enough to get snot down my shirt, and have had to taxi home to get changed, then will have to explain to my boss why i'm going to be an hour and a half late today.

update:
have since arrived at work and explained to the boss what had happened.

my new nickname is smear and everyone is walking round with toilet paper hanging out of the back of their trousers.

would just like to also point out that the cold has currently consumed every soul in my office, which funnily enough is where i caught it.",4

"for running through neighborhoods in the early morning, making security lights come on and dogs bark?. i (26f) like to go for a run in the morning before i go to work. i usually set out around 5:00 am so i can make sure to get at least 5 miles in at a time before having to get ready for work. well depending on the time of year, i'm either running around sunrise or wrap up before, which means that people in the neighborhood have those security lights that pop up if you're in the area.

well people started complaining about their lights being triggered and their dogs flipping out at early times, and people on their stupid doorbell cameras will look at people going by and several people posted videos of me running by. i'm identifiable because i have a headlamp and flashers to make sure cars see me.

this was on that nextdoor app so i chimed in to say hey, sorry about that! and got dogpiled by people telling me to change up my route, or have more respect. some people told me to go to a gym, why don't i run in the afternoon or evening etc etc. i told them i had no way of remembering whose house has what lights or what dogs and that it's just something we all have to deal with. i'm not going around complaining about the sprinklers that come on and drench me because they aren't calibrated right! and then said that i love to run in the morning because it makes me feel good through the day to which someone said ""yeah try getting woken up by some smartass who won't be neighborly enough to just go to the gym!""

anyway i've gotten some really nasty notes and people keep posting videos of me and comments saying that i should really get a gym membership and other people calling me rude because the dog barks and wakes up the baby or something. i don't enjoy running on a treadmill. never have, never will. besides why pay out the ass to be leered at and hit on by gross dudes when i can run in the darkness and watch the sun rise? seems like a no-brainer, right?

my best friend has suggested i just head out later, but i won't have enough time for the rest of my routine (shower, breakfast, etc) if i do that.

&#x200b;

eta: tried to grab all the info questions. 

1 - there are no parks nearby large enough for me to run in. the only one around here is about one block, and it is surrounded by houses. i pass this park already. there are no ""trail systems"" or anything like that either. 

2 - i don't run the same exact path every day. no matter which street i run on, there's inevitably security lights and dogs. i have 5 or 6 different routes i'll take. i don't think it's even the same dogs barking at me on those routes. 

3 - i don't have a car, so i can't just drive out somewhere else. 

4 - again, i'm not getting a gym membership. my budget doesn't include that kind of luxury, and the closest affordable gym here is about 6 miles away to begin with. 

5 - i can't run later in the morning. i have to be out the door at a certain time to get my full 5 miles in.  5:00-630, exercise (warm up and cool down included). 6:30-7:30, getting ready (shower, coffee, breakfast, put together lunch or it's already made, makeup, hair, getting dressed). if i don't leave for the bus at 7:45, i will not get to work on time.

"i am the reason my wife's best friend left her.. no regrets 

like the title says, i am the reason why my wife's best friend left her. i do not regret my actions and i would do it again without a second thought, but i don't want her to know the truth. using a alt/throwaway because she knows my main account. 

about 10 years ago, when my wife and i were still dating, her best friend, who we will refer to as ""n"" got her hooked on shooting up pills. dilaudid, to be specific. if you've dealt with addicts that shoot up, you will know there are two kinds. those who shoot because they feel like they have to, and those who seem to get off getting other people to try it. my wife was the former, while n was the latter. i did notice a pattern. as long as n was not really involved in her life, things were good. she could easily stay clean. but should she be exposed to that stuff (99.99% of the time n was involved) she had the hardest time being clean, and often relapsed. we had a long talk about all of this, and no matter what she wouldn't cut n out of the picture, no matter how much or how badly n fucked her over. i still do not know why that was the case to this day. she moved in with me later that month, and decided once and for all that she wanted to build a life with me and wanted something better than addiction, but she never did cut ties with n. about a week later, she relapsed because of n. i had enough and decided to take things into my own hands. n came over to my house one day when my wife was away, and i knew this was my chance. i met n at the front door with my .45 handgun. i made it clear to her that she was to cut all ties with my wife, and to never show her face anywhere near our home (she lived a couple of towns over). i told n that if she ever did contact my wife again or even come near us, i would gun her down right where she stood. when she said i was full of shit i cocked the hammer and put my finger on the trigger. she got the message and left. she never did contact my wife ever again, and she moved away somewhere. my wife still doesn't know why exactly n cut ties with her. she has been completely clean ever since. we have been married for 8 years and have 2 kids together. 

only me and n know the truth of what happened. i just wanted to get this off my chest. 

edit: holy hell, i really did not think that this would have blown up the way it did! thank you all for the kind words, before i go on i want to make it clear that i do not condone my own actions then and i don't want any of you doing what i did. i am not a violent man by nature, and frankly that could have gone so wrong. pretty much the only reason why i did what i did was because i felt there was no other possible way i could intervene at that point. i loved (and still do) my wife more than anything, and my thought then was going for broke. all, or nothing. fortunately, i won. here are some answers to questions that some of you had (pm's and comments)

>will you ever tell your wife the truth?

i've considered it. i probably will after our kids are grown, but that is about 20 years away. 

>are you worried about your actions coming back to haunt you?

no. after this happened my wife and i both moved clear across the country. we had been planning it for some time before, and this really spurred me on to get serious. we were both moved within about a month of this. the only real social media we really even use is reddit. n is a junkie, not a super spy. i'd sooner expect half life 3 to come out before her finding us.

>did you get your wife therapy? what was the deal with her drug use?

yes, i did get her to go to therapy for about two years. i got back the woman i fell in love with because of it. she did have some prior drug problems in her teenage years, and was clean for about 4 years (coincidentally, that sobriety ended when n came back in the picture for a little bit). since then, she has remained clean for over 9 years now, still going strong.

>why the hell did she not cut n out?

my theory is because they were childhood friends who weathered abuse together. that will forge a hell of a bond. n was the one who got her on drugs in her teenage years, and again in her early 20's (when this all happened). i think the only reason n remained friends with her was a, because she could mooch drug money off of her, and b, because if her friend was doing drugs, she wouldn't feel bad. 

>would you have pulled the trigger?

at that time my blood was boiling pretty damn bad, so i think there is a good chance i would have. i am glad that it didn't have to come to that. don't get me wrong, i still want her to get what comes to people like her, but not by my hand. i would prefer it be by her own. 

also, for some reason a lot of you want to see this series of events as a movie. not exactly my taste, i prefer a good western movie. but hey, to each their own. again, thank you all for your kind comments and messages, i really appreciate that. god bless. ",11
"for letting my friend fall when she did that stupid trust fall bullshit?. i guess you could say from the title i'm the asshole but hear me out.

guys, i'm not exaggerating when i say she does this ""trust fall"" crap at least 19 times over an hour time period when we're hanging out. she always makes sure it's when i have my arms full, am sitting down, or am eating. basically at the most inconvenient times. it's actually obnoxious as fuck and i've told her at least 10 times to not be ""that"" guy and that it's annoying and unfunny. so naturally she does it more to piss me off.

we were hanging out after i had wrestling practice, which is super tiring, of course. i was stretching out on the couch and she was sitting in a beanbag chair. i heard her get up and when i heard her call out ""trust fall!!!"" like the smug fuck she is, i didn't even get up. she fell on her back onto a carpeted floor, but it was a cushioned fall because she realized i wasn't getting up to catch her. no, she didn't hit her head. she even kept her upper back from hitting the ground by using her arms.

she immediately got up and demanded to know what the fuck is wrong with me and that she could have been seriously injured. i told her the truth, that i'm sick of her shit and she knows she's just doing that trust fall monkeyshit to get on my nerves. she left in a huff.

i've gotten mixed reactions from my friends. i probably know the answer already, but aita?

edit: y'all, i know she's into me. she told me she likes me awhile ago and i told her i'm not interested and actually into someone else. this stupid falling behavior worsened afterwards. also some people ask our age - we're 15. we are in fact dumb teenagers.",3

"for demanding my sister and her boyfriend pay me back for drinking my whisky.. my sister started living with me recently and pays me reduced rent. i was away from home for about a week due to work. i gave her a simple rule of forbidding her bringing anyone over. not her new boyfriend or her friends. no exceptions to this rule. well she broke that rule.

during my week away. one of her instagram posts showed her bf wearing one of my jackets on a night out. i called her out on it and she apologised and told me she put everything back. so now i know that he has been in my room and going through my things. 

what killed me inside was that she also had a party. lots of drinking involved. including my vintage whisky. they cost me around £7000 and were near full. so i demanded that they pay me back. 

my sister is begging me that she didn't know and thought her boyfriend bought them. her boyfriend blocked me and called me crazy. he is now thinking about breaking up with her over this. everyone i know is calling me an asshole for demanding they cover my loss. apparently i should forgive a simple mistake. so aita?",3
"ga our baby was billed for its own delivery resetting deductible and costing us $3,5000. hey everyone,

thanks for reading over this. my wife gave birth 3 months ago and, when going through the bills, we noticed that our baby was billed for its own delivery. conveniently (for the insurance company), this meant that it applies towards my son's deductible ($3,500) instead of my wife's which had been fully met at that point due to an earlier hospital stay. our insurance covers in-network hospitalizations fully after the deductible has been met. our insurance provider is saying that this is required under a ""state mandate"" in georgia but i can't find any reference to this. if anyone has any experience with health care law or can tell us anything helpful here it would be greatly appreciated. thanks!

edit: thanks for all of the incredible helpful replies! i'm slammed at work and can't respond individually but i will try to follow up tomorrow. i've submitted an appeal to the hospital to have them review the charges and they are going to send me an itemized bill. if they confirm that the charges are, in fact, related to the care of the baby instead of delivery, then it sounds like i will end up needing to pay the second deductible. i will let you know how it gets resolved. thanks again!",2

"for sending a tinder asshole to mcdonald's?. i'm using an alt for obvious reasons. 

for backstory, i'm female and live in the u.s. i'm on dating apps and i'm finding that a lot of guys are just disrespectful. some of them are polite and want to start an actual conversation, but a lot, maybe even the majority, are just ridiculous.

a lot of the messages i get are ""wanna fuck?"" or ""what are you looking for?"" which is their way of indirectly saying ""i want sex with minimal effort"". i even have in my profile that i don't do random hookups, but i think i overestimated how often people actually read the profiles.

after having this happen a dozen times, i finally snap. a guy on tinder messages me and the conversation seems to be going okay at first. we message back and forth and then i don't hear a response. that's okay, people get busy. 

at around 11:30 pm he hits me with the ""sorry, i got busy. what are you up to? wanna have some fun?"" during our initial conversation i make it crystal clear, i'm not looking for hookups. i don't to casual sex. so i remind him of this, and he starts negging me. ""i knew you'd be a prude"", ""not sure why you wasted my time"", ""let's just meet up at my house and talk and see where things go."" 

finally i was like, ""okay, but come to my house."" and then i proceed to give him the address of a mcdonald's. in the next town over. i waited for him to get close to the location, he confirmed that he was about 5 mins away, and i unmatched him.

"i kicked my best friends boyfriend out of my car before a vacation, making them miss our flight. now she's not talking to me.. sorry for any formatting problems i'm on mobile, tldr at bottom because this is long.

my best friend and i are going on 15 years of friendship, and we (along with our friend group) planned a vacation. the day of comes and since i have the largest car i volunteered to drive us to airport parking. it's about a two hour drive from our small town to the airport, so uber or lyft was out of the question. we're all excited for the trip, listening to the radio (a rap music station.) 
and about an 45 mins in, my best friends boyfriend (who is hispanic, it's important to know) starts complaining about the music. it was about 3 am (yay early flights) and i didn't feel like being on aux and my car won't allow others to connect to bluetooth while it's in movement. other members of the group also say they'd rather listen to this than whatever the pop stations are playing at this hour. after about 10 more minutes of sly remarks and complaining, he blurts out ""i wish you would turn off this damn n****r music!"". 

it felt like time stopped. now, our group is pretty diverse. mostly hispanic, but a few white people and a couple of black. i'm not black, but i immediately looked at my girlfriend who is and i could see the shock and anger on her face. before anyone could say anything i pulled over to the shoulder and parked. i told him either apologize or get out. he refused. now i'm not a confrontational person, and he knows this. we've been acquaintances for more than 5 years. so i assume he thought he could just say no and i would budge and continue driving. of course i didn't and repeated that he has two choices, either apologize, or get out. by now my best friend started apologizing for him and saying we need to go to make it to the airport but i responded saying i wasn't moving until he apologized for his racist remark. others in the group told him just to apologize so we can go. he doubled down saying if i had changed the music this wouldn't have happened. 

now i admit it was early, i was cranky but long story short he got out of the car with my best friend with him. i drove off after they got their bags. the rest of the ride no one spoke. while boarding the plane i made mental note that my best friend and her boyfriend weren't there. when we got to the hotel i apologized to my friends for making things so tense, because at the time i felt like i had ruined everything. they let me know that they agreed that what he did was wrong, but the group was 50/50 on if i overreacted. 
the next day they were both back with the group, but we weren't speaking. about three days into the 5 day vacation she messaged me saying it was awkward and we all should get together to hash it out. i told her we can, as long as he apologizes. she texted me back that he felt the same way, and i needed to apologize to him for trying to control him(?)
so that's where we are. i don't feel like i should apologize because while i feel remorse for making them miss their flight, it 100% could've been avoided. it's really causing a divide for us, this is our biggest fight. her boyfriend is a bit controlling so talking to her by ourselves isn't an option. at the core i feel like he shouldn't have said it, and he said he feels like i have no right to tell him what he can and can't say. what should i do? i want to apologize for kicking them out, but i can't see the conversation going anywhere.   her friendship really means a lot to me. 

tldr: best friends boyfriend says racist stuff before a vacation. i kick him out and she goes too. i want him to apologize he wants me to apologize. no more friendship.

# backstory

&#x200b;

my wife was the perfect person for me. she was not only everything i wanted, but was also everything i didn't know i needed. we were infatuated with one another, to the point that she missed out on a prominent internship just to spend the summer with me (albeit, she still got valuable job experience thanks to my family ties in the area). in return, i moved to ri to spend the next year with her for her senior year of college. i moved us into a gorgeous apartment in the heart of providence, and paid a hefty sum for the rent, but it was the best year of my life. i got to live with the person i loved most, and actually get a preview of living together, and it was amazing. i had never felt this way about another person before, but i didn't ever want to jump the gun or become too clingy. she definitely had more dating experience, so i looked up to her in a way, to be sure i wasn't crossing any lines or making her uncomfortable. she put all my worries to rest though, when after almost 3 years, she asked me to marry her. i was floored...but with her encouragement, i still wanted to make a spectacle of it, and so i proposed to her in front of all her family, friends, and some of her teachers at her graduation party. even though she knew it was coming, boy...her tears streamed down her face and she clung to me and squeezed like i was her favorite stuffed animal (she called them stuffies).

&#x200b;

our life, for 4 years together, was like a never ending honeymoon. we lived for one another, sickeningly affectionate, each other's best friends, wonderful and active sex life (at least once a day, sometimes twice). i would do anything for her at the drop of a hat, especially as it seemed she had an unfortunate run in other relationships and friendships. she was so underprivileged, so i made it my life's goal to make up for all that, with not only presents and experiences (vacations, resorts, etc.), but most of all with the love and respect she so desperately deserved. i told her that, no matter how bad things were for me before or what mistakes i made, that i would never change a thing in my past or hers, as it made me who i was then and there and brought us together. after we married, we found ourselves a nice ""first house"", and got decent jobs, things moved along like clockwork. my friends loved her, my family adored her (mom and dad especially), she got along well with everyone and i was so proud to show her off! i made sure that, even though we were in my neck of the woods, that she never felt like an outsider or that anyone was against her, and if they were, i removed them from my life. we missed spending as much time as we did before because of the work, but hey, it was time to go full on adulting! at the end of our 4th year together, however, something started to change...

&#x200b;

she became...irrational, hysterical, about the smallest things. it got to be so bad, that i took off 3 weeks from work to nurse her, and shuttle her around to different specialists to try and get to the bottom of her problems. i adopted two cats so she had some more company if she was home and i wasn't. i picked up extra hours at my job to make up for her job not giving her full time hours, and she refused to change jobs due to her delicate mental state. the love was there, but with a huge cloud over it. i could barely ever see my friends or family because of how much alone time she demanded, and then our sex life completely dried up, at the time because i thought it was her medications. it became like having 2 full time jobs, but i never minded because it was a labor of love. my body did though, and i had, what i thought, was a heart attack at the time. it was a panic attack, however, that sent me to the hospital, i was simply too overworked and over stressed. i just wanted my poor princess to be better again, i would do anything...what she then really wanted was to go back home and live with her parents together. this was it...the biggest mistake i could ever make. i knew this was a toxic place, that messed with her so badly before, that she was different when we went to visit, but...i was desperate to fix her, and if this was it, i had to do it. i packed everything up, and moved us all the way north to maine. the beginning of the end.

# trigger (aka, the juicy stuff)

as a quick aside, her father was and is a great man, and the sole provider at their household, and looking at him, i found out why she loved me so much, i was just him but younger/not blood related. her mother though...is a narcissistic, lazy, drug addled, entitled cunt. that becomes important, i promise you. oh, also another aside, anything that you think was obvious? like ""oh yeah man, of course she was doing that..."" oh, just wait...it was always worse than you think. just say to yourself, ""but wait, there's more!"", amplify it 3 fold, and then you have an idea of how fucked things are. for me personally, the living situation was atrocious. the house was a disaster, junk and filth everywhere, acrid smoke from cigarettes and weed clung to all the clothes and furniture. her parents were poor and massively in debt, so...i suppose you know who had to cover every extra expense, besides the normal living expenses. just a month after getting there, the ex wrote a check for over 4k out of our savings to pay for their property taxes from the previous year, and that's only the start of that. i had no room to myself, no privacy, and no way to clean or make room, as i wasn't allowed to touch or move their stuff (pictures included below). so, yeah, seventh circle of hell living situation, couldn't leave because she didn't want to, and couldn't leave because she was constantly siphoning off cash to cover her parents bills, because her mother refused to work. anyhow, continuing below!

&#x200b;

we moved into her parent's house/her childhood home, as that is the only place she is willing to be. i had just given up my own home, all my friends, family, contacts, and comfort to be here with her, as well as i was dealing with the sudden and tragic death of my aunt, so i didn't exactly hit the ground running. luckily, i had virtually no bills or debt, so i didn't cost anything while looking for a job. she got a job right away, and i was so proud of her, straight to gm at a restaurant! it was almost immediately, but...the love was gone. nothing, i was treated like a stranger and a burden. she never wanted to spend time with me, avoided me, and started to become increasingly aggressive. i couldn't even believe this was the same person. this was my reality for all 3 years of me being there, as she became increasingly violent and abusive, to the point of physically attacking me, gaslighting, and starving me emotionally/intimately. it was hell on earth, the love of my life was also my tormentor. after those 3 years of begging, pleading, trying to get us to counseling, collaborating, and fighting, i gathered up as much as i could and ran back home by myself. i almost ended my life a few times up there, as it was preferable to living without her or living with this twisted new version of her, but with the aid of my family and some drugs, i somehow pulled myself together and got out.

&#x200b;

so, what happened? well, to start, only 2 months into being back in me, she started an affair with a co-worker. this guy could hardly speak any english, but she has this...fetish for latino people, odd ducks, and older men, so this guy drew her attention. i was somewhat aware that her huge shift in behavior had to be from cheating, all the signs were there, her talking about him a lot, comparing, defensive of him, treating me like garbage, etc. this is where the gaslighting came in heavy though. you see that beautiful picture i painted above of how i loved her? she knew how much she meant to me and how much i loved and respected her, so of course, it was unconscionable that she would ever do that to me...right? any questions or insinuations that there was something going on, she made me feel so guilty for ever suspecting her. eventually, i dug around, and found some even more obvious truth. she erased any texts, but not pictures she had...so many pictures of him, some without his shirt on, and then...a naked picture of her, one she never sent me for sure. i confronted her on this finally, and she admitted to it...in part. she said it was just emotional and flirting, and swore on everything that nothing physical ever happened. i believed her at the time, and go back into ""caretaker mode"", because her grandmother passed away, so i bury my broken heart and rush to be her rock. seems like that's all to that story? but wait, there's more! 

&#x200b;

much later, i find out through her old ex fiance, that she was facilitating threesomes between her, him, and the co-worker. taking showers together, oral sex, anal, everything. this was going on for 5 months. so, not even tip of the iceberg, i was completely out of my depth. she...was a master manipulator, i was no match at all. she had me, her father, all these other men, all in her pocket, and only giving nuggets of truth to keep us all off guard and weary of one another, all except her. her ex fiance? well, he seemed like a hopeless orbiter for a long time, trying to maintain a friendship, but always hoping she'd come back to him. when i was working my ass off after finding a job, and she crashed her car into her own restaurant out of rage (its own story), she was routinely going to his house and jerking him off, having sex, etc. that's how she kept him on the hook, and reaped all the benefits of his money and attention. her needy friend that she made out to be a hopeless clinger? turns out she actually initiated a gay relationship with her when they were 14/15, and used that to give her the devotion she craved, but was too embarrassed to let anyone know she was bi-curious, so swore her to secrecy. when she became inconvenient, my ex swept this poor girl under the rug, and pretended it never happened. source: the old friend admitted it to me, and my ex confirmed it, even though i figured it out long ago, i trusted her word that nothing ever happened (see a pattern?).

other co-workers? turns out, after she got her new job (after 7 months of not working while i paid her debts), she was fucking around with them too, and if someone drew attention to her being married and denied her advances, she accused them of being gay. her...teachers? yup, she fucked them in college, and the one when we moved back to me. one of them, an elderly man at the age of 60, was on the damn culinary board at the college. no wonder she got valedictorian then, eh? she left her email open on my computer, when she was too lazy to use her own pc...and some of the stuff i found was...well, i don't have words for it. they were in constant correspondence, in school and out, for years after. the piece de resistance for that? the, but wait, there's more moment?! though it predated me, it was, and i shit you not....a fucking **sex contract**...signed by her ex fiance, her, and him. it stated that...she would marry the fiance, who would get to use her sexually whenever and put on the show of ""married couple"", while he would willingly allow her to carry on her affair with her married, 60 year old teacher, and would eventually carry and bear said teacher's child, as he never had one. the fiance would then raise said child as his own, so the teacher could carry out his primal desire to pass his genes on, she would get her love affair, and the fiance would get the sex that she constantly held over him. what the fuck did i walk into? i only have proof of one teacher, but i highly suspect a few others, given their odd tendencies and attachment towards her.

&#x200b;

just...so much was hidden from me, so much i was blinded from, and she so maliciously abused my love and trust in her to keep on doing it. any time i questioned her, she went on the defensive, and was a master of arguing. if she was drunk, she would get extra crazy, and in two instances, struck me. after i started putting all the pieces together, it was obvious. she was a rampant narcissist that thrived on attention and control , but worst of all...she was just plain psychotically evil. i don't even just mean with me, she was malicious to some of the people who loved her most, way before me and throughout her whole life, and she destroyed so many other lives and situations just to feed her ego. i couldn't believe it...how did i fall for it all this time? how did my whole family fall for it? she never once had to pay the consequences, and now...after taking me and my family for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and abusing me for 3 years, almost to my own demise, she happily moved on to her next victim. he's some rich 50 year old colombian business man, that she was screwing while i was paying for her medical bills and taking us to long-distance marriage counseling, because i was still attempting to save the marriage when i left maine to save my sanity.

&#x200b;

# the point?!

&#x200b;

so...after all that...what am i here for? well, simple. i'm at the end, with the divorce papers in hand, ready to send them in and end this nightmare, cut her out of my life for good. i'm still tortured daily at what my best friend and soul mate became, or truly was all along, and it's preventing me from forming any new meaningful relationships or even being somewhat happy anymore. i'm not in any sort of suicidal ideation, but i get a sickening amount of relief by just imagining myself out of existence. i've never been a scorched earth kind of guy, and i still can't imagine causing any physical harm to her or anyone, but...should i still do something? she extorted me, during and after the marriage ended, for our marital property and even my own property. 

&#x200b;

she kept everything from the marriage, including our babies, the cats. even my new tv i just got...she guilted me to letting her father keep it, which i kinda let happen, since i'd be dead if not for him, i owe him that much. if i take her to court, she won't be able to pay anything, without me around, she already has to work 2 jobs to make up for my income to support her and her parents. it would be almost just to be petty and bleed her out, but...then i risk hurting her father in the process. this is probably my only chance to do something court wise, before the papers are signed, but...is that the only avenue? should i even bother being the avatar of vengeance for all the people she hurt and lives she ruined, or just hope it comes naturally down the road? she's gotten away with so much already...so many lives, adultery, and straight up felonies that i have proof of...do i just let it go, and hope for karma? or am i myself the karma? i know what i would normally do, and that's just let it go and try to manage somehow, but...so many of the people in my life are suggesting different paths, so i come to you, the faceless masses. what would you do given a position power after being down and out so long?

&#x200b;

**tldr;**

ex wife is absolutely crazy, and tortured me maliciously for 3+ years. i have evidence of all her misdeads, legal or not, and am ready to sign divorce papers. do i act on both pettiness and a sense of duty and try to get some stuff back/make her pay for her crimes, or just cut all losses and hope she gets what's coming to her later?

&#x200b;

anyhow, feel free to ask questions, point out inconsistencies if i made any narrative mistakes, and so on. i tried to organize this word vomit, but it was done with a lot of emotion and pain, so it's not always as coherent to me as it may be you. it's probably why a good amount of what i post gets ignored anyhow, but live and let live! pictures will be included of my living conditions in an edit, so you know i'm not overblowing it, and perhaps others upon request.

"mom gave vague credit info to a company who offered to pay off balance. they paid it off and 12 days later it's still $0. scam?. all she told them was the balance amount, who the card was with, her first name only and the expiration date of the card. absolutely nothing else. i kept telling her not to do it because they contacted her through instagram, the numero uno of red flags. 

she did it anyways and they paid off $1200 in cc debt. i'm almost sure it's money laundering or something but it's been 12 full days since they've paid it and it's still showing as zero balance and the credit card company said the payment has completely cleared.

they gave her their account information to make the payment.

update: convinced my mom to report the card stolen and freeze the account. she took screenshots of their entire conversations and they had a website set up to convince her. they have a website (http://burdenfreefinancial.simdif.com) they used to convince her to do a ""cash flip."" 

i'm just annoyed that she didn't see this was a scam clear as day in the first place. she even gave them my information and sent me their banking info.

update 2: okay... she refuses to change her passwords. she won't request a new card. she now tells me that they asked her to send them $200 and they will pay off her 10k credit card. and she's going to do it. 😐

she seriously thinks she's outwitted them because she withdrew the $200 and deposited it into a separate account and only would pay them via paypal instead of direct wire.

she keeps saying how their website is so nice and that's what nonprofits do, help people. a website full of typos and ugliness...

"(update) by letting my manager know i had sex with her daughter and that i took a pic of her too. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/buxuye/tifu\_by\_letting\_my\_manager\_know\_i\_had\_sex\_with/?utm\_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm\_medium=web2x(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/buxuye/tifu_by_letting_my_manager_know_i_had_sex_with/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x)

sorry for the long wait for those wondering what happened. first off, wow, i am a fucking idiot and so are my friends. anyways, i probably stayed in the bathroom for a solid 30-40 minutes figuring out what i could possibly do to save my ass after writing the original reddit post. i decided to go back and just come out clean since there was no way i could save this especially after the text message notification. it would've been possible to do so if my friend didn't text that at the same exact moment, but that just sealed the deal. first thing i did was to show her that the pic was deleted for sure and that she could look at my phone if she didn't believe me. i told her that i had a thing with her daughter this year and found her (the manager) attractive, so i ended up telling my friends about it, who became interested. i also said that my friends and i were being completely immature about the whole situation, and that i would understand if there were any consequences. somehow, she was being considerate and could see that i was fucking trembling (also i am an intern, so i guess that helps since im young). she replied back by thanking me for the compliment but what i did was completely unacceptable and would get me fired anywhere else. she said that she'll let this go (probably understands that i'm an idiot, but also young), and that she will have a talk with her daughter tonight...

currently, it is the night, and i am scared to go back to work tomorrow because i have no clue what the daughter will say, but at least the mom is being understanding. will update tomorrow.

update: it is tomorrow for those wondering (may 31st, 9:45 est time). i am sweating balls right now. she just came into the office and i am not ready to talk to her again. will update what happens. 

update 2 (10:59 est time): i'm not sure if i have to make a new reddit post or can just update y'all here? but anyways holy shit, it's been an hour. so when she came i could literally feel the tension in the air. i didn't make any eye contact, just pretended that i was working on stuff even though i couldn't focus. she said let's go to her main office/room and talk (she usually works at her table next to mine but for important meetings/conference calls, she just goes into the room). she says that she brought up my name with her daughter and nothing bad came out of that convo (so thank you ____, if you ever come across this). then she said we will move past this and never talk about it again and that i should learn from my mistakes. she said that to break the awkwardness, we will get lunch today?? she was in a hurry, so i feel like it hasn't been completely cleared up. i'll keep you guys posted. seems like i'm in the clear though haha. not sure if i should reach out to her daughter now

update 3 (3:00 est time) lunch date: i am back! wow okay, so basically we went out to eat, just the two of us,  and we were initially in the car just talking about work. i was acting pretty quiet because i was still shook at how things turned out, but i'm sure she could tell i was still tense because she slowly made our convo more casual by asking personal life questions like about my family, etc. now this is where things went different... she started talking about her family, and how's she's a single mom, etc. i ended up showing a picture of my fam to her and she said, ""wow, what a beautiful family. you guys are all so cute together."" then the convo diverted towards her daughter and she asked me how i knew her. i said from school (i'm sure she already had asked these questions to her daughter last night but she probs asked me this just for the sake of convo starters). at this point, i remembered reading your guys crazy comments about what could happen and felt a surge of confidence come back and keep in mind my boss is pretty hot, so i'm like fuck it let's see where this goes. i say, ""yeah she's really cool and a lot of people think she has beautiful eyes. i can clearly see where they come from now (hinting at my manager)."" she gladly smiles and says wow thank you, and we continue to talk. now i'm back at the office, and i just got an email from her - bbq at her house sunday night. the whole team was invited which is like 10 people.  

tldr for update 3: i feel like i'm thinking with my dick now, is that a bad thing? honestly i could just be overlooking this whole situation and she wants nothing to do with me. i'd be the luckiest man alive if i can go from fucking up that badly to fucking the boss. might have to delete this thread soon just in case though.

update 4 (bbq): nothing happened, everything is normal. i talked to the daughter too and just caught up with her for a few mins and that's all

"i (f 26) told my husband (m 29) he was scaring me during an argument, and now he's very distant from me.. two nights ago, we were fighting. my husband had not been in the best mood all day anyway, he was very stressed from work and tired. so it escalated fast. i felt like he was taking out all his feelings on me. he was yelling at me, insulting me. all i wanted was to have some peace and go to sleep. so i got up and started to walk away. he grabbed me by my arm so i couldn't and said ""don't walk away from me when i'm talking to you"". his grip was so painful and he just made me feel so small. i told him ""please you're scaring me"". as soon as i said that, he let go of my arm. he said, ""why are you scared?"". i couldn't say anything, i just started to tear up. he pulled me into him and i cried into his chest. he told me it's alright and i have nothing to be afraid of. he carried me back to bed, but he didn't sleep in our bedroom. which felt weird. he didn't even say goodbye to me before he left for work in the morning but he left me flowers and the attached note said ""i'm sorry"". when he came home from work and ever since, he's just been so distant. not cruel or anything, just distant. he'll kiss me but only on the cheek or forehead. he doesn't want to talk to me. he doesn't want to have sex. i don't understand. it wasn't my intention to make him feel badly if i did. how can i talk to him? i think he is just upset with himself. but i don't want him to be. i don't know what to do.",7

"coworker says he's suing me because i didn't drive him to work, so he tried to walk and fell, was injured. ia.. iowa city, iowa. one of my coworkers recently began called/texted me overnight saying his car was towed while he was out to dinner and he needed a ride to work in the morning. i have never given him a ride nor told him i would give him a ride, but i am the only other employee who lives close to his neighborhood.

i did not see the messages until i was on my way out the door, at which point i responded saying that i was unable to give him a ride.  since our office is about 7 miles from where we live, i assumed he would take the bus (which has a pretty straight shot to that area), a cab or an uber/lyft. instead he apparently decided to walk to work. i did not suggest that solution, to be clear. apparently after walking 3 miles he became tired, fell, hit his head and hurt his arm.

he is now threatening to sue me saying that i failed to give him enough notice that i would be unable to drive him. by his logic, he contacted me before midnight and gave me 8 hours notice, but i only let him know i couldn't at 7:45, ""forcing"" him to walk.

"scared to tell my (24m) girlfriend (27f) that i was raped.. i have a good relationship with my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years. we live together and love each other very much. we have overcome difficult circumstances before, and i think we can overcome this, but i'm terrified to tell her.

i recently went on a trip out of state. i stayed in a hostel close to some bars. in my room was 2 young men and one older woman, in her 40s. i introduced my self to all of them i went out to the bars that night with the guys i had met, who were great company. the lady from our dorm went her own way. 

later that night, i got very drunk. i texted my new friends after we got separated to let them know i was on my way back to the hostel. on my way back, i see the older woman from our hostel sitting on the curb. i'm slurring my words at this point, but asked her if she was ok and wanted to walk back to the hostel with me, about 8 blocks away. this is where my memory after leaving the bar became very hazy. i remember her being overjoyed to see me. i remember her complimenting me but though nothing of it.

the next morning i woke up feeling like absolute trash. sick, cold and nauseas. still a little drunk. barely remembering the details of the previous night. my roommates are passed out and the lady is checked out.  we all slept til 3 p.m.; occasionally i got out of bed to throw up.

i talked to my roommates when we woke up and they were giggling and complimenting me. i didn't understand why, and asked them what they meant. that's when they told me that they saw me with the lady on top of me when they came back to the room last night. i instantly felt way sicker and a rush of anxiety overcame my body. i didn't remember that night, but i remember that i had no intention to have sex with anyone, especially an older woman. i didn't consent to whatever we had done, i didn't want her to mount me, i didn't go out looking for sex, i know i wasn't turned on or erect, i feel that i was raped. 

i was scared of so much at this point; stds, pregnancy, ect. i really cannot recall what happened, but i know my intent when i came back was clear: i did not want to have sex. i debated getting the police or my hostel involved and still sort of want to, but i know from my first conversation that we were all from out of state. i feel that there's no point in getting the law involved now. 

what i'm terrified about is telling my girlfriend. i got an std test 5 days after and i'm clear, but i'm scared she won't believe me because i am a man who was assaulted by a woman. i think she will think i cheated on her and intentionally looked for this, and it breaks my heart and terrified me. i don't know what to do, or how to bring this up, but i feel like i need to tell her. how would you bring this conversation about.

"my husband married my co-wife because we were told i was infertile. i love his second wife. now i'm pregnant. what do i do?. i'm from a culture where it's okay for husband to have up to four wives although it is not often done. when my husband and i got married he said he only ever wanted me. we got along great and we fell in love soon after the wedding. (arranged marriage). 

after trying for a child for a long time we found out i had diminished ovarian reserve and we would not get pregnant and ivf would most likely be futile round after futile round. 

i was absolutely heartbroken i could not bare his children for him. he was more okay with this than i was. we discussed and reached the decision together for him to have a second wife as long as she would be a good fit for his life. for example, would she be okay living together with first wife (me)? our religion says a second wife has rights to her own place. 

we didn't rush into anything and i actually found a girl who was interested and i introduced her to my husband. they got on well and i didn't have very much jealousy and things are great. 

they got married and we all live together. while there were ups and downs (just like my husband and i when we first got married) eventually things were great. we all lived together and our husband treats us both excellently. she soon became pregnant and we were all excited. her pregnancy was hard but i looked after her. when baby came i was also a mother and love this child like my own. we all get on so well. 

she now has a 4 and 2 year old to my husband. when we discussed our feelings once. she said she feels secure because she has been able to give our husband children. and i feel secure because i was his first wife. 

however. i just found out i'm 8 weeks pregnant. i never expected this to happen. and really i am so happy. but i'm terrified how this is going to change our relationship dynamic. i am scared she will be hurt or our house hold might be split into two households and then i only get my husband 50% of the time with a newborn.

i briefly even thought of suicide or abortion but i'd never ever do this. ive just really been in dark place and being really emotional. i really don't want to hurt my co wife though. i don't want to ruin our family dynamic. i also feel pressure of time. i haven't told my husband or my cowife.

please i really need advice.

"always pay for a sewer scope as part of the inspection process when buying a house, doing this saved us $18,000!. we are closing on a big 1953 rancher tomorrow, and as part of our inspection process we hired a plumbing company to do a scope of the sewer line (putting a camera down to see the condition of the line, if there are any tree roots, etc in there). my wife is a realtor so she's seen a few instances of people having major issues with their sewer lines after buying a house, and wanted to be sure we avoided it. 

the guy scoping found that it was the original orangeburg(https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahukewisjptbvvdvahvo6gmkhzmoazkqfggomaa&url=https%3a%2f%2fen.wikipedia.org%2fwiki%2forangeburg_pipe&usg=afqjcneh2gmfbzryq7pzbaxb-rnm7alazq) sewer line, and that it was unraveling. the typical lifespan of these lines is about 50 years. this one had been there for 64. this material was very commonly used from 1940-1970s. 

the sellers agreed to have it replaced, at their expense prior to closing. the total bill for the replacement was $18,015. 

had we not opted for the sewer scope, we would have been on the hook for that bill. 

hoping i can save a couple redditors some money and headaches down the road with this tip. 

obviously this is probably not necessary if you are buying a new, or nearly new home.

"the cream in oreos is the worst part of oreos.. it doesn't have may vanilla flavour or if it does it is very much over powered by the amount of sugar it has. the texture is like a booger to me and after eating 2 oreos my mouth feels like it is covered in fat and grease because that's what the cream basically is: a glorified sugar and fat mix.
the cream is so sweet that it even overpowers the great taste of the biscuit.
when eating oreos with a glass of milk the cream is still this thick gooey mass that ruins the great combination of the biscuit and milk.

personally i take the cream off before eating but it is stuck so badly that i cannot take it off completely. and any bit of residue gives you the same experience as taking a stick of butter, dipping it in sugar and then taking a good bite out of it.

"for denying my terminally ill wife the chance to be a mother?. i don't want a baby. i never wanted a baby. we are 24 and 25. she is very unwell, we dont know how long she has to live but most likely between 2 and 3 years.

when she was diagnosed she was told having a baby would kill her, so the fact i don't want one wasn't an issue. now she is looking into other methods that could work. 

this woman was born to be a mother, and she would be the best darn mother in the world. i feel terrible denying her the opportunity to ever know what it's like to hold her own little bundle of joy. 

that said, i think it's a bit unfair that she would like me to have a baby with her, take care of that baby, and my dying wife. just to have her die and leave me a 28 year old guy with a 3 year old baby i never wanted with a dead mother. 

my father died when i was 3, i wouldn't wish it on anyone. i don't want that for my child. i watched my mother from an early age looking after me and my sister with no help from a partner, she still has crippling anxiety issues and it's effected her massively.

 i know what's ahead of me and it's going to be fucking rough. is it selfish that i don't want to make it any harder than it has to be? 

i just want to go into a 6 month black hole of depression after she dies, i don't want to look after myself, certainly not a baby. 

as you can probably tell by reading this, i can be a bit of a prick. but i don't think i'm being a prick right now. let me know.

update: first of all i'd like to apologise, i mislead you, my so and i are recently engaged, not yet married. i said, wife, because i realise that a very large section of the people who read this would tell me to leave the relationship because being in the same headspace is essential for marriage. if she leaves me because she wants a family then i understand, but it's not an option i'm considering. 

i love her massively, i don't think she is interested in heading back onto the dating scene, and oxygen tanks can put some guys off. i've promised her i will look after her and i'm not going back on that. - im really sorry about that guys, i was trying to narrow down the advice to just yes or no rather than reading through loads of comments telling me to gtfo, but i accidentally made some people question if this was real - and by extension question their faith in humanity.... 

secondly, when my so and i met shortly before she was diagnosed and told that a baby was off the table, so we headed towards our future assuming that we were on the same page. 

thirdly, many people are asking what her illness is, i wasn't going to say because i was worried she would find the post and get upset. but because this thread is becoming so popular i think its a good opportunity to raise awareness about a very rare illness called pulmonary hypertension. you can read about it here: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/causes/

finally i would like to thank all of you. almost without acception, you have been incredibly kind and supportive. some of you think i should have the baby, some of you think its a terrible idea, but all of you are being honest, supportive and kind. ",3
"i work at a high volume bar in virginia and the owner wants to start charging us(the bartenders) for anything they deem to be loss for the night. sorry if this is the wrong forum for this question. we have struggled with liquor cost, but we have gotten it under control they gave us a goal of 20% cost and now it's at 18%, which is pretty amazing for a bar that does happy hour for 9 hours of the day. for example, the owners see that over a week, while pouring thousands of ounces of vodka we are missing 4 bottles of vodka for the week.  this is less than 3% of the overall vodka poured and since we are high volume and use free pouring, in any other restaurant i have worked or helped, it would be considered cost of doing business. if you do the math, it equates to us pouring about 1.57 ounces instead of 1.5 ounces as we are allotted for each pour. since we use imprecise pouring tools and we are far to high volume to use jiggers (a liquor measuring tool)  it doesn't seem right that they would be allowed to charge us for these overages. they intend on holding back our tips and charging us anything that they decide is missing every night. is that even legal? is there anything we can do to combat this?

edit: to answer a few of your questions. 

the bar does pretty well, and most of the bartenders that work  there are veterans, but as it's a slow season, finding more work is harder than possibly looking for a way out of this situation. the bar generally is set up to profit around 25k a month, but wastes all its money on a ridiculous menu and while constantly attacking ya for liquor cost, has a 42% food cost and insane labor amount as well. the owners are veteran business owners, but not of bars, they just see the total loss under a microscope and cannot fathom how it's accidental and not theft. 
i explained to them that even with measuring tools this number is amazing. 
i am one of their managers and have a pretty solid relationship with the owners,(they are paying for my somm education and travel expenses around the exams and learning) they generally listen to me, but i wasn't sure about this one. also i didn't want to bring it up and ruin my relationship and possibly lose my continued education if it was within their reasonable power to take tips.

a friend of my mom's liked clowns and had a small collection of knick knacks. creepy, i know. well, for 40 years all she got was clown crap. constantly. nobody got her anything that was something _other_ than a clown. 

or, when my wife was young, she liked shopping bags from high end retailers. who knows why. before long, she had massive amounts of them. boxes and boxes of these pointless bags. friends and family who lived in other parts of the country would send them to her. she got hundreds of them. eventually, her enthusiasm started to wane. but the bags kept coming. it took a real effort on her part to get people to stop giving them to her. 

not to mention you will end up with multiples of the same gift often.

"by snorting a tonsil stone. bodily discharges are only for the weekends, so i'm reposting from earlier this week.

like a lot of people, i sometimes get tonsil stones. and when i get tonsil stones, i remove them. normally, this is a very straightforward process, but luck can only take one so far.

a few days ago, i had a particularly large and nasty tonsil stone stuck in a little tunnel in the back of my throat. normally, they pop out without a hitch, but this time, my body had other ideas. no sooner had the stone come free, then my gag reflex went full benedict arnold, betraying my trust and forcing me to clamp my mouth shut in an effort to keep myself from vomiting. in my panicked attempt to continue breathing, i somehow managed to snort, bringing the tonsil stone straight up into my nasal passageways.

under normal circumstances tonsil stones smell bad. some would say ungodly. but this.

some say that when hercules cleaned out augeas' stables, the metric fuckton of rotting filth was washed back into the river. however, i can say with confidence that all of this filth was lodged in my nasal passageways. nothing else could possibly smell this bad. having a tonsil stone in your nose is like going on a date with every drop of vomit that the human race has collectively ralphed. many tears were shed.

i blew my nose. i attempted to improvise a neti pot. i came thiiiiis close to pouring listerine into my nostrils. i didn't think i was ever going to sleep again. fortunately, it evacuated my sinuses one tiny, godforsaken chunk at a time over the course of about 3 hours, but the trauma had already been suffered.

tl;dr - i accidentally snorted a tonsil stone while trying to remove it, and all i could smell was the abyss of ass-rot.

"update maryland taken by emts against my will. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7iq9fh/maryland_taken_by_emts_against_my_will)

for those of you who may remember me from a while back, and those who read my original post just now, you're probably wondering why i'm bothering to post this update in the first place. i'll get into that later, but the short answer is that i believe the responses i received to (and the subsequent consequences of) my original post here played an important role in causing me to do a serious amount of self-reflection which resulted in me making serious, positive changes to my life. i suppose you could even call this update a thank-you of sorts. anyways, on to what actually happened after my original post 8 months ago.

as my edit to the original post implied, i did not get what i wanted from my original post. what i wanted was a bunch of people to tell me what i wanted to hear, and to provide an escape from the consequences of my own reckless behavior. what i got was a whole lot of people reminding me that there was no one to blame but myself, and that i had to now face the consequences of my actions. naturally, i refused to accept this, and went ahead and ""consulted"" a lawyer. i say consulted for the lack of a better word, as it was more like said lawyer showed me the door shortly after i pleaded my case. 

this, however, did not deter me. if anything, it only invigorated me further. i decided on pro se representation. the first step was, of course, collecting evidence. and by ""collecting evidence"" i of course mean showing up to the fire station that housed the ambulance that picked me up drunk and demand the information i wanted. luckily, this was at approximately 3am, and only one firefighter was awake at the station at the time.

i suppose i should count myself extremely lucky as he did not immediately call the cops on me, but instead sat there patiently and listened to me as i screamed unintelligible nonsense at him. even offered to give me a ride home using the departments utility truck. needless to say, i did not acquire the information i sought out, so i returned home and passed out. 

when i woke up, i woke up to a shit storm. the original post i had made here had apparently been cross-posted to another subreddit, which somehow led to me being doxxed and humiliated by almost everyone who knew me. even my boss laughed at me. suppose i should be grateful that i wasn't fired. 

in any event, the humiliation led to me taking a step back and looking into my life with an outside perspective. i hated what i saw. i hated it so much that i swore to myself that i would change. and somehow, i did. sort of. i never actually ended up filing anything with any sort of court. good thing too. would only have served to waste my money and humiliated me further.

i came to the conclusion that i was a functioning alcoholic. a few months ago i began to try the aa route. it was hard, and i released a few times, but as of posting this update, i am over a month clean. i don't really want to get into the details of my recovery, but needless to say the slap in the face i got from the doxxing of the post i originally made here really helped out. 

i won't bore you guys with the details of how i proceeded to clean up my life after that, but i consider myself i seriously different person than i was 8 months ago. and it's all due to a chain of events that was borne from the original post i made to this subreddit, and for that, i'd like to thank you guys.

i suppose i don't have a single reason for actually posting this update, but i hope you guys know that your advice does help people, even if it may not be in the way originally intended. i'd always like this story to be an example for others is situations similar to mine. really makes true the old saying that if everyone else at the table tells you that you're drunk, then you probably are.",2

"by not washing my hair. for some context: i am a 23 year old female and the only woman in my department, everyone a) is taller than i am and can therefore see the top of my head, b) definitely doesn't know much about women's hair products.

to keep it short and sweet, i was tired last night and didn't want to wash my hair (yes, i showered, but it's probably an extra 30 min to wash **and dry** my hair before bed) so i put dry shampoo in my (dark brown) hair, braided it, and went to sleep. usually the dry shampoo absorbs overnight and doesn't look white in the morning.

ladies, i think you know where i'm going with this...

with the braid, my hair was all pulled back while i was getting ready this morning and i took my hair down when i got to work. i work at a luxury car dealership so there is some standard of appearance, especially for those who are out on the main floor.

i just went to the bathroom, 2 hours later, and realized the entire crown of my head was starkly grey/white, and i've been walking around looking like the very top of my head aged 50 years overnight.

tl;dr: dry shampoo made me look like a 70 year old woman at my place of business and i didn't notice until i'd been talking to coworkers and clients for 2 hours.

edit 1: wash and dry takes 30 minutes, not sure why people keep missing the last half of that statement. also, i usually use cocoa powder as dry shampoo but used the rest of a travel-sized baby powder this time. and yes, i looked in the mirror before leaving, but since my hair was in a braid i saw the underside of my hair not the crown.

edit 2: yes i know that not all men are taller than women. the men i work with are. sorry if i didn't word it perfectly, but you don't need to be social justice warriors and say i'm generalizing groups of people.

"i think i'm having an affair on my husband.. my husband and i have been married for 6 years. around 18 months ago my husband started talking to me about cuckolding. up until then our sex life was fairly normal. over the space of a couple of months he went from asking what i thought about cuckolding to asking if i wanted to cuckold him to asking me to cuckold him. in the beginning i was very dismissive of it. i honestly thought that he was just testing me - like trying to see if i'd cheat on him if i could get away with it. to be honest, i had no interest in doing anything like that but he kept asking so i finally said that i'd do it.

he put an ad on craigslist and found a guy. as you'd expect, the guy came over, had sex with me and then left. we did this 6 times over the next year. i didn't like the arrangement very much and i felt somewhat violated but i did it for my husband because he wanted it. somewhere around the start of this year one of the guys started coming over regularly (2-3 times per month). during that time my husband and i haven't been having sex at all and i've felt very unloved. so i feel this way about my husband but at the same time i have this handsome man coming over whom i kiss and have sex with and this ultimately creates a weird bond between us. about two months ago i started texting him outside of our direct sexual arrangement. he works about a block away from my workplace so he has invited me to lunch a few times. yesterday after we'd eaten lunch he pulled me to him and kissed me.

my husband has no idea that we've been talking. he is coming over on friday and we're going to do our thing again and i just have no idea how to deal with all of this. i think that i'm having an affair on my husband but i honestly don't know if he'd be upset if he found out. he has been encouraging me to have passionate, intimate sex with this man for 6 months now. how am i not supposed to catch feelings for him on some level? i am so confused about everything and i have no idea what i'm doing or how i feel. i feel nauseous just thinking about all of it.

if you define yourself by your sexuality or gender identity then you're an uninteresting person..  i'm tired of hearing about people flaunting their gender identity as if it was in any way interesting. by all means. fight for equal rights(even though i think equality is impossible). everyone deserves to be treated with neutral politeness until they do something against your personal set of beliefs.. but if you take your identity or sexuality or whatever word is used for things outside the basic binary of sex chromosomes(minus mutations like hermaphroditism) and that becomes central to who you are? the most important thing about you as a person? then good gods you must be boring. sure. some of it is desensitization i suppose. throw it in peoples faces until they stop caring. but what you are is so unimportant in the scheme of things compared to what you could say or accomplish. i don't really see why someone would choose something as unimportant as gender as the thing to define themselves by and i tend to think less of people who do this. the only time i think your gender and sexuality should matter is when you're dealing with a potential mate. ,6

"by screwing myself out of a career for years. obligatory this has happened over the course of the last 2 years but i just realized the 10 minutes ago.

&#x200b;

some background, i work in software technology. i've been in this field for 10 years and over the last several years have been trying to change my career path within this industry. my current position is kind of low paid/under-valued by nature, even after so long doing it. i've picked up higher level process driven skills and have really shined in my current company in an attempt to move into something better.

&#x200b;

forward to the last couple of years. i'm generally mishandled in my position and wind up shouldering a lot of the work that various other people drop because *we trust you and know you will do a great job, buddy!* that hasn't been translating into promotions or pay. i've been passed over for good opportunities several times at this company. i've been eager to move on from here and begin my new path properly.

&#x200b;

problem is, i haven't gotten any responses back to any of the resumes i've been sending out. for 2 years. i get the occasional recruiter which will always fizzle out after the initial ""wow! you seem **perfect** for this job!"" now, i try to be modest, but i know that my resume absolutely rocks. nothing is misspelled and i am well represented in it. i had a css designer work up the formatting for my resume a few years ago and it looks gorgeous! my skills are all up to date and i even have recent tertiary education. what the hell is going on??

&#x200b;

tonight i finally decide to scour some sites and forums for tips. the first one i go to is talking about bullet points. yea yea. the next one is giving advice about ***strong verbs***. yep, implemented/developed/improved/advised. already ahead of you. the third site i hit is talking about.....

&#x200b;

automated resume screening. removing formats and tables. wiping headers. leaving only text in tact. assigning ""scores"" to resumes based on parsed data. then it dawns on me. my resume was formatted by a css designer in 2012!! technology has evolved, in a field that i specialize in, and i completely fucking forgot!! all of my contact info is contained in headers. all of my experience and skills are contained in formatted tables. fucking tables. my resume is getting destroyed by automation before anyone even has a chance to look at it. no wonder i haven't gotten any calls!!

&#x200b;

for some reason, i was still under the impression that my online-submitted resume is getting printed out and put into someone's hands for review, or at least looked at by a human on a computer screen. real progressive thinking here, huh? i should at least be proud that i wasn't dense enough to send them off via the post office....

&#x200b;

the problem here is that this whole ordeal has give me some pretty sever confidence issues. i've been pushing myself harder to try to be better because of this, which has been leaving me depressed and exhausted constantly. late night panic attacks over what i'll do if i lose this job. wanting to quit but feeling trapped because of no call backs. ugh....

&#x200b;

so i've rewritten my resume into plain text in a basic word doc, and it honestly looks pretty nice. the formatting removal has saved me some space and i was able to get some new and important pieces in there while maintaining one page. i feel like a moron and probably don't deserve to work in software anymore, though.

# big update:

holy shit, this blew up more than i could have imagined.

first, thank you guys for the gildings and getting this on the front page. first ever! go figure it's on a throwaway! i've seen so many people on here that have gone back and revamped their resume because of my experience, and for that i'm thrilled to have made a positive impact on some of you.

secondly, there is a lot of disagreement around what the best resume file type is. all i know is that every company i apply to asks explicitly for a word doc. my resume was originally an html back when it made some sense but now it is not, but it kept the nuances of what the css genie did. i did not build the resume myself! i constantly fought with the formatting to make minor updates. design is not my area of focus, obviously.

the thing about getting contacted by recruiters and then it fizzling. as many know, when a recruiter finds your resume on a job board, it tends to be a very old/stale resume, especially if you've been employed for a while. the convos always end with ""send me an updated resume"", and that's where the convos drop off. yes, i am assuming that my resume is being processed by automation, but who knows... it seems too coincidental.

next, i love the equal divide between ""don't be so hard on yourself"" and ""you are a dumbass"". it's why i love reddit!

i will eventually be able to read all of the responses, but will likely only be responding to people who want to talk to me about job opportunities. that is my ultimate goal after all.

and finally, with my new resume in plain text, i have already gotten scheduled for an interview! a recruiter contacted me via email this morning and a phone interview is already on the books for next week. and it's relevant to my new career path.

thanks again, everyone!

* use a mix of short descriptions and bullet points in your work experience. 1-2 sentences and bullets for achievements.
* don't worry about passing 1 page if you are doing online applications. some of the best advice i got from people.
* make  sure you are visible to recruiters on linkedin. this may have been a factor in the lack of regular cold calls.
* be patient. took about 2 weeks before the flood of emails began.

"update-for kicking a girl off our airsoft team for not following our rules. update is we had our meeting and i sincerely took feedback from r/into meeting.. i got permission from the moderators to update and i wanted to share what happened. 

here is the original if you didn't see it yesterday:

https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/apiwrd/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_off_my_airsoft_team/


since people had things tonight we agreed to meet over lunch and all but 3 people agreed to show up, even among the people that quit outright. so including me 16. i got to the office where we had it and was so surprised to see madison sitting there. so that made it 17 people. the guy who has been on the team the longest  basically said that in light of what happened sunday, he would do the talking. this really annoyed me but i remembered how much bad feedback i got here and didn't say anything. 

they started off by having madison say her thing. i have to admit she was very rational and but she did start crying which made me really uncomfortable. but basically her point was she just moved her for grad school, she didn't want to do the bar and club scene anymore and she said the loved all of us for never asking her out or making her feel uncomfortable and it was the first time she felt like she ever found a group of people, including her sorority, where people didn't judge her for her looks. i was like sure, whatever you think but come on. anyways she said she was really sorry for not keeping our standards and she was just trying to have fun and she is a girl and doing crazy things with her hair or wearing pink camo is just in her mind set. she asked me if i would please consider if i she could stay on the team. 

i was totally on the spot so i was just started out by saying that i was sorry and i overreacted. but then i said i think it's best if i step down because it was obvious i take it too seriously and if 5 people quit in the spot, obviously it was time for a change. but as long as i was still doing it, i was happy to have her back. 

so that lifted a huge weight in the room. so we got into more business and it turns out that the reason madison had not bought her competition gear is because she was reaching out to various companies using her ""insta-fame"" to get our team sponsored. she said the reason she didn't tell me anything because these deals are very tenuous and she didn't want to let us down if they fell through. so she's still working on the uniform stuff but she did get an incredible deal to become a representative for an ammo company so starting with the tournament in march we will have absolutely free airsoft pellets, which for a team of 20 people who play mostly every weekend is huge. she is starting an airsoft specific instagram and she expects it will take off and she'll get deals for the team. i'm literally blown away by her generosity and i'm sure she'll make some income from it, but she's choosing to share with us after the way i treated her. 

but anyways so we talked about more team business and we decided that we would sort of split the leadership position in that we would have an adminstrator for day to day stuff and that's going to be the guy who started the meeting but everyone was happy with how i managed the team for tournaments so i'll be in charge of all tournament related business and conduct at tournaments.  we also agreed that we would dramatically loosen the uniform requirements for weekend local play and madison (or anyone i guess) could wear her pink camo or do her hair in bright red pony tail puffs as long as she was being safe (no belly shirts) but tournaments we would still have our team unforms.

so that is where we are. team is still together, we get a bunch of free stuff and maybe more on the way. madison is cool but it was the first time a teammate hugged me after a meeting but i guess we have to adjust to hugging and crying at our meetings. it's weird but i guess i can stand to update my world view.

"i (22f) woke up in the middle of the night to find my best friend (22f) sleeping with my boyfriend (24m) in the living room. throw away account for obvious reasons, and sorry for any formatting, i'm on a mobile.  

i don't even know where to begin, my head is such a mess right now.. so my boyfriend ""john"" and i have been dating for three years and at the beggining, it was the most romantic love story. i met him when i was 18 and starting dweating him when i was 19 and qt more i dated him, the more i saw a future with him. 

he would always put time and effort into me, take care of me and go an extra mile to put a smile on my face. but things have changed since then to say the least, after about 1.5 years of dating. it started with little things, like him not wanting to kiss me as much or finding excuses to not hang out. we went from seeing each other every day to only hanging out maybe once or twice a week for two hours. i know he's got his own life and i'm not trying to control him, but i wish he would make me feel a little more special and maybe make an extra effort to see me. 

i should probably also mention that i suffer from depression and a low self esteem, and it's probably really hard on john when i'm in a bad state. i try not to but sometimes i just can't help feeling so alone and in the dark. 

so anyways, we were celebrating my bestfriend's  (ex-bestfriend now?) birthday at my house last night with a bunch of friends (maybe about 20) and there was a fair bit of drinking. the reason she couldn't have the party at her house was because she shares her place with room mates, which was fine because i had no problem throwing her party at mine, as long as she helped clean the house up in the morning. 

the night went alright, but i did i notice john and ""sarah"" (the best friend) we're getting a little too close like him grabbing her from behind and spinning her around. but i just brushed it off because i never noticed anything before and we are all bestfriends. 

so after around midnight, everyone has left and john, sarah and i are just chilling in the longueroom laughing about our night together. and when it was ready for bed, i set up a mattress in the longueroom for sarah and john told me he'd be in our bed soon. so i went to bed and crashed alone. and maybe after a few hours i woke up in the middle of the night desperately needing to pee. now i don't have a bathroom connected to my room, it's down the hall. so i slowly get up and realise john isn't in our bed?? so i went to walk down the hall when i start to hear like moaning noises and i'm like wtf and i peek my head down the hall to see john and sarah having sex. i know i should of confronted them right there and then but i couldn't, i just sneaked back into bed and cried silently. i didn't even have a chance to pee. 

so now it's morning, johns snuck back into our bed and is acting like nothing's happened. i've lost a long life bestfriend and a boyfriend i put three years into you. i don't even know how to confront them, i'm not even sure if i can confirm what i had seen because we were all drinking, it's driving my insanity crazy. but the real kicker is that john and i haven't slept together in months, but he can sleep with her. i just feel so low. 

how can i comfort them and even begin to process this? i don't want to lose john, we have our ups and downs but he's everything to me :((( if everyone has ever been in this situation and has any advice, feel free to let me know, just don't be too brutal. i think i already know what i have to do..






edit 1: i used the excuse that i had to text my mother ""what day were hanging out today"" (i don't have credit and john knows that, so he didn't suspect anything) and i went through his phone and the evidence was pretty damming, they've been sleeping together for a while.. i took screenshots of their conversations and sent it to my phone in case he tried to deny it.

after all that, i confronted him when sarah left, it was so hard to even get the words out. and you know what, he denied it!! he told me that he loves me more than anything and would never do that, and that i should know that and to stop accusing him of such silly non-sense. that's when i told him i've seen all of his and sarah's messages.. at first he still kept denying it saying ""someone's hacked his accounts"" and he doesn't know what i'm talking about, but eventually he broke down crying saying he loves me and doesn't wanna lose me, but couldn't feel the spark anymore and it was the biggest mistake of his life. he wants to make this work and push past this.. well maybe you should of tried instead of sleeping with my best friend? 

so i told him to leave, and of course he doesn't ""know"" where his car keys are and asks if it's okay to stay for a few hours when his best friend mark gets off work so he can pick him up. it was so difficult to say no but i did, i just wanted to be alone. i don't even know who he is anymore! he ended up ""finding"" his car keys and he's been calling and messaging me ever since.

as for sarah, i got a message from her saying this (i'm assuming john gave her the heads up): ""i can't even explain how sorry i am my name, i never wanted to hurt you and i don't know how this happened, but something grew between ""john"" and i and i can't deny that what we have is so intensely strong and real. i hope we can work for this and i hope you can someday come to become okay with me and ""john"" being a couple. i wish you the best of luck and when your ready, please message me. lots of love x""
so i dont know what to believe! john is telling me he wants to work through this while sarah is saying their a couple. i'm now going to be ending it with john and my mum is gonna come meet with me and stay for a few days to make sure i'm okay. 

thanks for all the advice reddit :(

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


edit 2: first of all i would like to thank everyone for yours words of advice and support, i really appreciate in a time like this. 

some of you guys suggested that i send the messages that john sent me to sarah. me and my mum talked about it and how i might come off as spiteful and jealous, but i thought screw it. i don't owe you guys the time of day or respect, so i sent them to her. at first she didn't respond and ignored it, but then replied asking to meet up and discuss this. shes now playing the victim saying she had no idea that john still wanted to pursue me and that we've both been played. pftttt 

i have no idea if sarah messaged john or what came of those messages. i honestly want nothing to do with them anymore. my plan is to pack up all johns shit and leave it out the front outside, then message him he can collect it while i'm at work. he's got three days to get it until i donate it to a charity. i also then blocked his number and every social media account, so he can no longer contact me. i've also removed his name from any shared responsibilities/accounts we have together and any mail of his that is sent to my address, will be returned to sender because i'm not putting up with any more of his shit. 

as for sarah, i have no intention of keeping that snake as a bestfriend. but unfortunately we travel in the same friend group, so i'll just have to avoid any future gatherings that she's participating in. luckily i have friends that love me and will help me move through this.

thank you again for your support!

edit 3: he picked up his stuff, loaded it into his car and then showed up to my door! i told him to pick it up during my work hours but of course he didn't have the decency to give me fucking that!! i'm so angry! 

mum said that he tried to walk through the door and she told him to get lost and slammed the door in his face. i could hear him calling my name and it made me cry a little harder but i just wish if i could of have the scarification of watching him have the door slammed in his face! just arghhhh, what a peice of shit

"greyhound left me overnight at border crossing, lost 7k carry on bag, offered 4 dollars compensation. hi, i'm posting this since i'm at my wit's end right now bashing my head into greyhound customer service. to make a long story short, i traveled friday night from ontario to nyc. i booked a ticket that was supposed to transfer at city b at night and arrive at nyc in the morning.

the first bus leaving from city a to b was delayed by almost two hours, so i missed my connecting bus. agents were no help and told me ""you might have to wait till tomorrow morning"". upon arrival at terminal b, i spoke to a ticketer there who apologized and managed to get me on the last bus leaving to nyc for the night. since it was on such short notice, they didn't reissue a ticket and told me not to worry, they'd get me to my destination.

when we arrived at the border crossing, we were all told to leave our stuff on the bus and bring only what we needed to cross the border. since i was slotted in i was processed last. while i was going through customs, the bus left without me, which the cbp official said was a violation  since bus drivers cannot leave without receiving proper headcount and an ok from the border officials. i was left stranded freezing overnight with just my passport, phone, and wallet.

i called greyhound right away to let them know what had happened, gave them the bus number and itinerary, but they refused to contact the bus driver to secure my carry on baggage. they also refused to grab it right away after the bus arrived, stating ""it will eventually cleaned and maybe end up the lost and found."" the next bus only arrived at 10am, 7 hours later.

when i finally arrived in ny, surprise surprise my unattended bag had been stolen and had not ended up in lost and found. after several calls, they finally admit wrongdoing and have offered me a 4 dollar ""trouble voucher"" as compensation, citing that unfortunately since i was not reissued a ticket in the system they cannot do anything for me and they are not responsible for carry on bags.

lastly, i might have some recourse through my credit card insurance, however, greyhound refuses to even provide any evidence that the lost baggage claim exists, which is necessary for my insurance claim.

what can i do to be compensated? i had 2 laptops and a switch and items totalling 7k in the bag.

tldr: greyhound left me at border, my carry on was stolen, they refuse to do amything

edit: thanks for the helpful comments guys, i've been looking through and will contact a free consultation lawyer and see where i'm at in terms of a case. will post an update if it's available!

edit 2: as far as proving that i had the items in my bag, the very least i can do is show that microsoft find my device shows that the last time my laptop was active was friday night, right before boarding the greyhound.",2

"by burning my right eye retina after looking at solar eclipse.. well... not today but about 20 years ago. i was young teenager in a summer camp and did not know any better. i looked at the sun through my partially closed fist (to reduce aperture) with my right eye. i have a small spot in my right eye that kinda static (like tv static). whenever i take eye exam (reading letters), i have a very hard time reading letters with my right eye (because of the burned spot).

i have since got lasik (i had a slightly bad vision) and my right eye came out slightly worse than the left. all because we could not get acurate reading (i kept screwing up reading part).

burned eye retina, like mine, is incurable and inoperable. i will have to live with this all my life. it's not bad enough that would render me disabled, just annoying sometimes. 

please watch out for kids looking at the eclipse. they will see that all adults look at the sky and do the same. that is what i did. 

please be aware of eye protection tomorow.

tl;dr burned my right eye retina looking at the solar eclipse and now can not pass eye exam.

"2.5k taken from boa checking account at an atm in a distant state. they had pin. filed claim and lost.. the day before the charges appeared i used my debit card since i didnt have my cc on me.  i rarely use my debit card.  it wasnt at a sketchy place (it was at trader joes.  i did debit+pin which i now realize is a mistake) but the timing is really suspicious. i have no proof that this was where it was compromised though, but i hadnt used the card in 1 month at least.

i dont know what to do.  i remember when i called my bank the guy on the line said he never sees people win claims when the thieves have the pin.  the implication was that the pin is 100% not hackable so any breach is my fault.  he asked me if i had it written on the card, etc.

boa investigated and concluded ""no error"" and ""the claim was authorized"".

i called citibank, whose atm was used for the fraud.  they couldnt tell me anything at all, since i do not have an account with them. 

also, i filed a police report in my jurisdiction, not where it happened

what blows my mind is that this is a digital transaction in the age of infinite data.  i have the time to the second and and the atm at which it happened.  and no one can tell me the account to which it went.

either bank basically said to contact the other one.

edit: it was not a cash withdrawal.  someone paid their cc with a spoof of my debit card at an atm. (the transaction said citibank- credit card payment) thats why i cant believe they cant reverse the transaction.

also, i called the bank the day it showed up, due to a mint alert.  they told me it was pending and i had to let it go through and then file a claim.  i did that.",10

"cut cell phone expense from $225/month to $90/month by switching to prepaid. i'll admit it. i've always been a phone snob. i had to have the next newest iphone every time one came out. i've also always been a service snob. if i didn't have the name brand service it wasn't good enough. 

well, that all changed. my wife and i have started budgeting and trying to cut costs in places to start saving more and increase expendable income. this was a great place to start. we had the available funds to buy out our phones and have them carrier unlocked. once that was done we switched to cricket wireless. i can't speak for everyone but our service is better now. 

do your research and see if a prepaid service around you offers comparable coverage to what you have now. you may be able to save a bundle!

"29f i eavesdropped on my husband 30m crying and now i don't know how to bring it up to him. my husband and i have been together for ten years and married for seven. right after we got married, i was diagnosed with sarcoma and had to undergo intense and invasive treatment for almost two years before i was officially cancer free. it was an awful time for us both, but it definitely made us stronger as a couple. unfortunately, the cancer came back late last year, and we're going through nearly the exact same turmoil again.

my husband and i have been described as a good couple by many because we balance each other out. he's more of the rock, usually being more logical and blunt while i'm more emotional and imaginative. he grounds me and reminds me to be realistic, and i make him laugh and remind him to have a little fun every now and then. it's not complete night and day like that, and we're not caricatures, but that's the gist of our personalities and dynamic. it's always been this way. my husband did have to grow up faster than others in a lot of ways, as he was in and out of the foster care system at one point in his childhood and he had to help his mother provide for his younger siblings when he was still a child after his father got arrested. he has a strange relationship and dynamic with his family overall. i wonder if that played a small part in him being the way he is. he has dealt with depression throughout our relationship, even taking antidepressants and attending therapy during a few points. i take anti-anxiety medication and did go to therapy briefly during my cancer treatment, so i encouraged him and was supportive. he would always stop after a few months, saying he didn't like them and they weren't working enough to stop trying.

my husband has been incredible during my battles with sarcoma. he is always there to be with me during treatment. he has always been a shoulder to cry on and an ear to vent to during this process, letting me be emotional but also keeping me grounded with the facts. he has been very patient with me and understanding of my needs. he always seemed to have it together, as usual. he would acknowledge the bad situation but just make a plan to get through and execute. i would always tell him that i know it's hard for him too and he would say that it's not as hard for him, he's okay, and he doesn't want me worrying about me. he said this over and over again, so i would try to respect his wishes and listen.

saturday night, i was lying in bed when my husband came in and told me that he was going outside to take a phone call and that if i needed anything, to call him. i didn't think much about it. eventually, i got up and went into the kitchen to make some tea. i started to walk around the house waiting and heard my husband's voice from outside near the side of the house say something about his wife several times. i was a little startled, and initially, i just was going to walk away and ignore it. but i got a bad gut feeling, and decided to go check out what was happening. i moved a little closer and stood by the door.

my husband then said something about how he can't believe this is happening again. he said he feels so powerless watching me deteriorate and cry to him and not be able to do anything about it. he stopped talking for a bit then said something along of the lines of how it takes him a long time to get used to the way my body changes with the treatments and that he misses elements of my pre-cancer appearance, but then he feels awful and shallow for thinking that away because i didn't bring this onto myself; he said he feels like a shit husband when he feels this way because while he wants his wife to be sexually attractive, i'm worrying if i'm even going to survive. then he said that goes into his worries about if he's even doing enough at all and if he's good enough for someone like me. he then stopped and said he's sorry. i was confused at first but then i realized that he was crying. like heavily crying. he said that he doesn't like to talk about how he's feelings and cry or show his emotions, and that he's trying to put on a brave face, but it's difficult. he went on to say that he's scared and he really can't lose me, and he'd probably kill himself if he did because i'm the only constant in his life and the only person who loves him unconditionally. i was really caught off guard, as i'd never vaguely seen or heard my husband talk or cry in any way before. i felt a sudden bout of anxiety building up, so i walked away. i came back about twenty minutes later, and my husband was saying he feels bad about calling when ""they're"" so busy and he's sorry about getting emotional, it's not normally like him, he got overwhelmed vocalizing everything. i walked away again.

i went back to bed, and was confused and anxious about everything i'd heard. an hour later, my husband came to bed and seemed tired but fine. i immediately asked him if he was okay, and he said he was. i didn't know what to say to that so i just cuddled him and we went to sleep.

yesterday morning, my husband wanted me to look for some video on his phone, and while i had it in my hands, i looked at the call history to see who he was speaking to. it turns out it was a emotional crisis hotline. my husband appeared to have called them several times before but only spoke to them that night.

i don't know what to do. this changes everything. i can't believe him now, he's not doing fine and i do need to worry about him. seriously worry. he's suffering and doing it in complete silence. i feel strange and deeply anxious when i think about him crying like that. he doesn't want me to see him vulnerable and upset. he doesn't want to be open about how he's feeling. i can only imagine what else he's thinking, how he's making himself feel guilty for it, and how many times he's cried like that in isolation or to strangers on the phone. i don't know what to do. yesterday, i wouldn't leave his side. i asked him how he was doing constantly and gave him a lot of physical attention. i was scared to leave him alone. he kept saying he was fine and to stop worrying. he thought i was being weird, but he enjoyed it and didn't want me to stop. he left for work now, and i'm just sitting here not sure what to do.

do i confront him on it? do i just do my part to try and make this easier for him? do i suggest that he gets back into therapy? do i try to open up a dialogue another way? he doesn't and won't tell me the truth, just acting like he's fine all the time. i'm so worried about him.

**tl;dr; my husband of seven years called an emotional crisis hotline and cried speaking to them about him struggling with my sarcoma. this was the first time i've ever caught my husband being emotional and expressing how things have been affecting him. he has always said, and still will, say that's he's fine and not to worry about him. i don't know what to do and feel deeply worried and scared about him now.**",7

"for not apologizing for sleeping with a woman's husband accidentally?. in june, i met a guy we'll call chris on tinder. we met up for dinner and had a great time and got to know each other. he told me he was recently divorced, and divulged that the reason was that his wife wanted kids and he didn't. this was great because i mention being childfree in my profile (i'm 31 so this comes up a lot).

we met up again and ended up seeing each other a couple of times a week and sleeping together for a little over a month, before he showed up in my facebook 'people you may know' and he was very clearly married with a kid and wife. i confronted chris (and of course ended things) and he begged me not to tell his wife before he could, because she's pregnant and he wants to be the one to tell her. i said i'd give him a week.

within the week, his wife messaged me on facebook and said he told her what happened, and i gave her the full story. i told her i was sorry he'd betrayed her like this and fooled me, and that i of course never would have started dating a married man. as we were winding down the conversation, she then told me she wanted me to apologize for sleeping with her husband and that she needed that for closure.

for me, this was a record scratch moment. i did nothing wrong here. i had no idea this man was married, let alone had a kid and one on the way. when i found out i confronted him immedaitely, broke up with him immediately, and forced his hand in telling his wife. there is nothing on my conscience here. i was lied to, too. i am not going to apologize because i feel like it's disrespectful to me to try to make me accept blame.

for not being willing to apologize? i don't know this woman, and her feelings here don't have more value than mine do to me. i don't want to debase myself with the kind of apology she wants, and she's furious and spamming me with messages because i'm 'unrepentant.'",3

"clubbing is overrated and a waste of time. seriously, why is this activity so popular? how do they bring any value to their customers? from a male perspective, the one purpose of going to a club is either to get drunk or pick up women. the former you can do at home or in a more controlled environment. as for the latter, most women will have their guards up and, even if they don't, the music is too loud to make any kind of charming entrance and conversation anyway, unless you plan on screaming down a woman's ear which, let's face it, isn't going to make the best of impressions.

from a female perspective, you doll yourself up for 3 hours in front of a mirror, wear the most uncomfortable shoes, dance like an idiot in the same spot for another 3 hours while holding on to handbag, drink, phone and your friend that some guy is trying to drag away from you, so that you can dance with other women who have done the exact same thing as you and so that you can reject most guys who approach you because why on earth would you want to be talking to some stranger in a loud, dark place anyway?

never mind the fact that you have to pay for this ghastly experience which could also potentially hearing loss because of how loud the music is, which is unbearable anyway regardless of volume because of how crap it is.

tldr: clubs suck.  


edit: wow, so much hate (the incel accusations in particular), but thank you to those who didn't take my opinion personally.   


just to clarify a couple of things. first, i am not against drinking or alcohol. if you read my post carefully, i said you can do this in a ""controlled environment"". what i meant by this were places where you're not exposed to some of the excesses of clubbing, such as loud noise, drugs and, it must be said, overly drunk people who sometimes can become violent.  


secondly, just because i think clubbing is overrated doesn't mean i have always had this opinion. some people rightly pointed out that i must be over 25, which i am, but i'd like to think my opinion now is more informed (nevertheless, it is only an opinion). that's because, believe it or not, i did used to go clubbing, particularly during my teenage years. like many teenagers, i had my share of fun at the time and i can see the appeal. you are exposed to new people, free of the chains of your parents and the law (you can finally drink alcohol). and yes, it can provide a fertile atmosphere to get off with someone, particularly if you already know him/her. but i think the novelty wears off and a lot of people in this thread have pointed this out.   


what i find troubling though is how many people in this thread have suggested that clubs are the only environment where you can meet and connect with people, which i can only say is totally ignorant and perhaps suggests people struggle with their confidence outside clubs. to paraphrase one person in this thread ""women don't want to be approached in places outside clubs"", such as coffee shops, supermarkets, parks, or whatever. this is a bit rich coming from people who have said i am insular, but if you truly hold this opinion then i think you are the one who is not fully experiencing the world. sure, people (women in particular) don't expect to be approached outside clubs like they do when in clubs, but that doesn't mean they won't be open to talking to you if you make an impression. personally, i have met some very interesting people in unexpected places who went on to become good friends of mine.",6

at this point in my life, i had my own bathroom that had abysmal ventilation, but it had a shower/bathtub combo so we decided on using my place. i guess i conflated the ideas of sex being hot and temperature being hot because i cranked the shit out of the heat in that shower.


2 minutes later and we've begun the act. the act itself was rather unpleasant. the plopping and squishing noises of our wet bodies were completely unexpected. as a tall dude, i have to like semi-squat behind her. after about 5 minutes or so we get into a groove and i can feel myself nearing completion, but i also start feeling very weird. between the squishing, the squatting, the thrusting, and making sure nobody gets waterboarded accidentally, i realized i hadn't taken a breath in about 45 seconds. this sexual experience had been an entirely anaerobic experience for me and i just realized.


as the bald man is about to cry his first tears, i desperately gasp for air. the steam in the bathroom is now a dense fog that contains little usable oxygen. immediately, every muscle in my body simultaneously cramps. i fall out of the shower while decorating a wall with a peter-parker-esque web. at this point, my muscles are too fucked to even attempt to stand, so i begin a last ditch effort to crawl to open that door while still cumming. my partner is visibly horrified and shrieking as she watches my wet, doughy, pale ass slide like a slug to the door, leaving a trail of water and my own ejaculate.


after i managed to get out of the bathroom, i lost consciousness about 4 feet from the door. when i woke up, the girl was dressed and ready to leave. in my exhaustion, i mumbled a goodbye to her and waved as she departed. i always think about that goodbye from her perspective; a giant half-conscious naked man lying on the floor covered in his own semen waving goodbye. she might still be in therapy working out that image.


tl;dr had shower sex and cramped up/passed out from a lack of oxygen, having to crawl out of the bathroom while still ejaculating, 6/10 experience overall",4
"i secretly let my dog sleep in bed with us because he was abused as a puppy and i want him to feel safe.. my boyfriend and i adopted a very sweet pup from an animal shelter about a year ago. when my dog was a puppy, he was seized by the police from an abusive situation, and his previous owner is currently in jail on an animal cruelty charge. 

i love my pup so much and we treat him like our baby. however, we have a small bed that can't fit the three of us, so my boyfriend has a strict ""no dogs in the bed at night"" rule. that said, after my boyfriend falls asleep, i lift him up into bed (we trained him not to get into bed unless we lift him up) and he sleeps at my feet. i always wake up before my boyfriend, so he never notices. 

update: thanks for all of the love reddit friends! i had today off so we spent the day snuggling in bed together (pic below)!

"by doing a strip dance for my wife.... with my mother in law watching. (happened last night). my wife and i have a really playful & sarcastic relationship, and we love to mess with each other in just about any situation. my wife had been on face time with her mom for a while, and so i decided to try to get her to crack by doing a stupid strip dance. i was on the other side of the camera, so *in my mind* only my wife could see the true glory. it definitely got nsfw pretty quick and then i heard my mother in law say ""omg put your clothes on!""

wife was sitting next to a window, turned out my reflection was positioned perfectly so my mother-in-law saw the whole thing. of course i didn't notice the reflection and my wife wasn't paying attention to her face cam to warn me.

thank god my mother in law is cool- cuz the next thing she said was ""well, i guess you guys have some business to take care of. have a good night, love you both!""

"by being the only man alive who doesn't use vaseline as lube. this didn't happen today but last night. i've been back home visiting my parents with my gf for the past week. now me and my dad have always been really open about things in our life, including things like relationships. so yesterday night around 10pm things were winding down while myself and my gf decided it was about time to go to bed. right as we head to bed my dad makes the joke ""now remember my room is right above yours, i don't want to hear any funny business up there!"". he was clearly being sarcastic so we started joking back about how we were going to have crazy sex up there and he'd just have to listen to it.

we all laugh and then we head upstairs to get ready for bed. now for the second piece of context, i have a skin condition that makes me really itchy downstairs, pretty much everywhere from the groin over to the rectum. so i have a couple creams i use, but for the rectum in particular the skin is really sensitive so i was instructed to just used medicated vaseline. i usually put in on every night before bed and it helps me from wanting to constantly scratch my asshole all the time.

so as usual i head to the bathroom, pull out my bathroom bag, and pull out a tub of vaseline. our upstairs bathroom door has never fully locked/shut since the door was never aligned correctly so the door is always openable, but usually its not an issue. i get some vaseline on my two fingers and start applying to the aforementioned area right as my dad busts in the bathroom to tell me something. i still have no idea why he did this, but its more than likely he just wasn't thinking.

so there he sees his only son, lubing up his asshole from a tub on vaseline, naked as the day he was born. he starts saying ""what are you doin-"" and then you can see it click on his face. the tube of vaseline, me effectively lubing up my asshole, the jokes about having ridiculous sex, all of it. he immediately goes pale and gets super embarrassed, then runs out of the bathroom yelling ""o-oh, s-sorry!"". 

i was too embarrased to go talk to him right then so i just went to bed. this morning when i came downstairs i started to bring it up and he just looked away and said ""what you two do with your free time is no concern of mine"". i will probably never be able to convince my dad that i am infact not into pegging.

tl:dr i used vaseline on my asshole for medical reasons and now my dad thinks i like having my girlfriend peg me

edit: for everyone asking, i have definitely seen a doctor about my condition. and for everyone in a similar situation who wants advice i highly recommend doing the same!",4
"update: my (17f) stepdad (51m) has been sleeping with my sister (24f). original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/bh4qad/my\_17f\_stepdad\_51m\_has\_been\_sleeping\_with\_my/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bh4qad/my_17f_stepdad_51m_has_been_sleeping_with_my/)

so i realize that in making this update i'm going to skipping over a lot of what happened in the past week because it's too much for me to type out and i doubt anyone would be willing to read all of that, so i'm just going to lay out what i know now about what happened and if people have questions i can try to answer some. at this point my sister and mom are the ones who need advice and support more than i do but they keep telling me i shouldn't be as involved as i'm trying to be. i'm mainly making this post because there were some genuinely concerned people in the comments (which i really appreciate) who asked for updates, and i also just wanted to give a big fuck you to all the people who brushed this all off as my sister just being a slut with daddy issues. 

i also want to clarify something that is extremely important that a ton of people seemed to miss in the original post: shaun is not my sisters biological dad. my sister's dad is someone my mom was with once casually and i don't know much about him, but i think my sister keeps in contact with him a little bit now. my sister and i have different dads. my dad passed away and shaun is not related to either of us. 

also if one more person feels inclined to make a joke about this sounding like a porn plot you can fuck right off. you aren't funny and it's really sickening for someone experiencing this to read, especially the ones saying that he's coming for me next. what's wrong with you..

anyway. so the reason all of this came to the surface is because my mom was in the kitchen cleaning up that night, and she grabbed his phone to look something up because she didn't have hers on her and the last thing he had open was his photos/videos. she said she saw that he had a folder of ""inappropriate sexual videos"" of my sister on his phone and she was sure that he was the one who took them because they were in our basement. 

before she talked to my sister all she knew was that my stepdad had these videos and that it was obvious my sister was aware that she was being filmed, it wasn't like he hid a camera somewhere. when she confronted my stepdad she said he stumbled over his words a lot and it took him awhile to give an explanation, but when he did it was obvious that he was lying. 

i made an update about this in the comments a few days after the original post but i know a lot of people missed it: all my mom told me the first time i saw her after this whole thing blew up was that the situation was complicated and she didn't seem upset with my sister. i had also overheard my aunt say something like ""this is what happens when you agree to have an open relationship"" and my mom got really angry. she ended up telling me about this a couple days later, but apparently she and shaun have had an open relationship because my mom has endometriosis and i guess she can't or doesn't want to ""be as intimate"" as shaun does, so she told him he could see other people as long as she didn't become aware of it, he didn't develop feelings for someone else, and it didn't hurt our family life at all. 

my sister ended up coming to stay with us at my aunt's house last monday, which is when she ended up telling my mom and i what happened. it took her awhile to get the words out because she was crying so badly and it seemed like she didn't know whether or not to say it, but basically: 

shaun offered to help my sister pay off her student debt if she let him film these videos. she ended up dropping out of school because her anxiety and depression were getting really bad, but she had been in and out of school for the past couple years and had taken out a lot of loans but didn't get her degree so the jobs she has aren't enough to pay them off. one of the only things she talks about is how stressed she is about money and paying off her debt. apparently shaun offered to help pay some of it off himself but said she needed to do her part too, and he told her that he knew how she could make money by selling/posting the videos. he would handle all of that for her, he just needed her to trust that he knew what she needed to do in them. 

i don't know the extent of what she did in them/what he did to her, but at one point she said he had first told her he wouldn't touch her, but after the first few times he started to get physical and threatened to stop helping her with her payments if she didn't. my mom cut her off at this point and said she didn't need to say any more about it, gave her a hug, and they both cried for awhile.

i've talked to my sister privately a few times and she said from what she can tell shaun has taken all of the videos down. i guess at some point when we were at my aunt's he came back and got some of his stuff, and my mom has since changed the locks so he can't come back in and we're not sure where he is. my mom said my aunt had been in contact with him the day or two after this all blew up and she told him to stay away from us and to get his things and leave, but hasn't heard from him since. we're living at home again until my mom figures out different living arrangements for us, my sister is sharing a room with me, and my mom sleeps in the guest room.

my sister told me our mom is trying to take legal action against him but my sis doesn't want her to because she feels like doing so will make this public and she just wants it to go away. my mom has also tried to get my sister to see a therapist, but my sister keeps saying she's fine and would rather put that money towards her loans. for the past few days everything that's been said about it is just between my mom and my sister, so i don't know if anything's changed, but it seems like they're trying to just not talk about it and focus on finding somewhere we can afford to live that's near my school and my mom's work. 

so i guess the only advice i can ask for is: is there anything i can do to help my family right now? and does this seem like something they should/can be taking legal action about?",7
"update people are constantly pointing out the disparity in attractiveness between me (28f) and my boyfriend (29m). how should i respond to this?. original post:https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blfh9u/people_are_constantly_pointing_out_the_disparity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

thanks everyone for some super helpful suggestions for a range of different scenarios. not so much thanks to the many people who inboxed me asking for photos... 

my boyfriend and i went abroad to a wedding this past weekend, a family friend of his, so with a lot of his family and friends. i was a little worried about it because it seemed like a prime time for people to be commenting on our relationship. well, i wasn't wrong. most comments were pretty well intentioned (from his friends and family), but i actually find these almost harder to respond to than the blatantly rude ones because it's hard to strike a balance between polite but still letting them know it's inappropriate. i went with what a lot of people suggested and just turned it back around (when someone said 'how'd you snag this one?' i jumped in with 'i was just lucky, i guess'). as people were drinking there was one or two slightly more rude comments. one guy said (jokingly, but still) 'damn, what're you doing with this guy!' so i pulled my bf into me and said gave a sly wink and said 'oooo, that's between me and him' which everyone laughed at. 

anyway, we ended up having a big discussion about it. he said he's getting used to it and trying not to let it really bother him so much, and that i shouldn't be offended or upset on his behalf. pretty sure this is the man i want to marry so we're just going to have to find a way to get overcome it. was good to hear in some of your comments that it just becomes a non-issue after a while. 

thanks again!",7

"for taking the office microwave?. over a year ago the microwave at my office died. the company refused to replace it. they said we could use money we earned for prizes to go towards that. this would take a long time. 

i wasn't having that. at the time i went out and spent about sixty dollars on a microwave. initially i kept it at my desk, but everyone kept coming to use it. so i moved it to the office kitchen. 

everyone who saw it at my desk is gone. it's just been ""the microwave"". anyway, my wife and i bought a new house recently and it needs a microwave. our new home is close enough to the office that i can commute home during lunch. so i took my microwave home. generally speaking i close the office and i'm the last one here. i took it home when nobody else was here without saying a word. 

a lot of my peers are furious i ""stole"" my own microwave. even the company owner and my manager are upset saying i snuck it out at the end of the day or that if i bought it for the office it should stay here. that was never my intention. i never communicated it , but i always meant to take my microwave home with me. it's not like sixty bucks is a lot of money but it's not an inconsequential amount. i dont see why they can't all chip in a bit and buy one that way. five bucks each or something. i said that and again more angry reactions. 

the screwy thing is my wife is even on their side. saying most people see it as company property and it's been there so long we should let it go and we should buy another one. i'm not willing to budge here. it feels foolish that i should donate my personal property because people expect me to. 

aita?

edit: thanks for the input on this one. i guess i was honestly an asshole here. i didn't intentionally bring it home in a way to actively make my coworkers uncomfortable but i think i was also stuck on the ""mine"" like a toddler. this is a bad situation for everyone. i'll take some time and reflect on bringing it back.

edit 2 : just to clarify my office has a lot of turnover. it was abundantly clear with that initial group of staff that if was my property. but since then it's a lot of new faces. not justifying anything. just providing more context to my actions.

edit 3:
obligatory ""this blew up way more than i expected!""

 a lot of people seem to be asking ""why doesn't your boss provide one"". i work in an insurance agency. we spend little time in office as possible. especially the agents and financial advisors. the owner believes more creature comforts = more reason to stay in the office. she says that's how it was when she came into the business. not a position i exactly agree with. it's nonsense to think a microwave will have a sharp decline in sales. at some level she is entitle to this opinion because she owns the business and she is the largest agent in the area by a very wide margin. not justifying it. just sharing. 

right now i've asked around the office and sort of calmed the waters with most everyone sans 2 or 3 people. most people took the apology in stride. a few are angry for the sake of it. planning on confronting the owner at some point tonight. a few people are willing to split the cost but that's if she isn't willing to cave on the issue. just wanted to add this.

final update : met with my boss. it was a very mixed bag. i read a lot of comments on and off today. i decided to throw some weight around. telling her how much i've earned her what i've done. i basically laid it to the basics that it wasn't fair what she was doing. i told her she created this situation. i told her most people who produce at my level leave in 5 months for other companies. i asked her why i shouldn't go to the place everyone else leaves to. 

she didn't like that. she told me this is exactly why she doesn't like appliances in the office. if it wasn't for clients she'd ditch the coffee machines and fridge too. we sort of went back and forth with this for a while. my boss asked me how would i like it if she went to my home and demanded i bring something in. she disclosed her annual salary. it's very similar to what i make. i called that bluff and asked about business profits. told her she wouldn't run a company like that if she only made some 11k more than me. 

negotiations broke down. at some point during this her assistant who's been with the company since day 1 went down the road and bought a microwave and toaster oven from a consignment shop a few blocks over using the imprest fund. she ended the conversation telling my boss ""quit your damn bickering and do some work so we can go home."" 

i feel bad about dragging my bosses assistant into it. that woman is a saint. but i suppose this is the desired outcome of it all.

edit whatever electric boogaloo: turns out at least one of my colleagues found this since it hit the front page. so that's... fun? but seriously y'all, posting ""quit immediately and now"". that's a bit drastic. i have a lot of gripes. but i plan on sticking with my job for a few years for experience. that's a funny thing you see on reddit a lot people say ""quit right the fuck now"". but like, people have houses/bills/etc. i have a daughter. this is the real world. you have to dance to that fiddle sometimes.",3

"my (24m) gf (24f) is unusually buying new bras and panties. over the last two and half weeks my gf has bought close to 9 new pairs of lingerie. this is unusual because she bought some 7 new pairs somewhere at the beginning of april. now i don't mind a girl buying new lingerie, but this is unusual - she had close to 40 new pairs of lingerie, a count which keeps on decreasing every other day. now i take out trash every given day, and i've observed that she hasn't thrown her old lingerie in trash over past one week, while there's no trace of it anywhere in our apartment. and yet she is missing 4-5 pairs from our common closet. she seems to act pretty normal, there's no dent in her daily routine. but it boggles me why she is on this lingerie shopping spree? it's not like she is amassing a stockpile of lingerie, her lingerie count is somewhat unchanged from the time before this madness. i couldn't find trace of her old lingerie. am i being paranoid? am i missing something here feminine that's otherwise normal? should i ask her anything about it?

tl;dr gf buying new lingerie every few days, while leaving no trace where she threw her old ones.

**update**: i might ask her while we drive down to the train station in next 30 minutes. will keep you guys posted.

**update 2**: alright i chatted with her while driving. i started off by asking her directly as u/fightmaxmaster suggested. she said something like she hasn't been feeling good about her underwear fitting (old and new) while at work. so she has taken a new vow - if she finds any underwear incredibly uncomfortable, she will throw it off immediately. i asked her i haven't noticed any in our trash (maintaining my casual tone) and she said since since we spend most our daytime at work she disposes it off in her workplace bin and carries pair of change underwear, like most women do. i even said to her jokingly ""oh, i was worried you were seelling your undies on ebay or something"" (just to get some kind of an answer) and she ewwed my remark. **do women do that at work or get rid off their old undies when they find it uncomfortable like this?** i could really use your insight on this. tbh, we moved together at the beginning of this year and this is the first time i've moved in with a girl, in a relationship. i don't know what else i could do, since she has made it clear she drops it off in work trash and has shown no intention/fetish to sell it online. but overall, i tried to make this conversation as 'just out of curiosity' as i could.

**update 3**: this is way too overwhelming. i am heading back home and taking a day off. i know i might be overreacting but somehow it just doesn't sound right, the conversation we had an hour ago. might talk to her again during her lunch break.

**update 4**: seriously guys, thank you!! i have been glued to my phone all morning along, except driving back home. it took me a lot of self-convincing to gather clues for a possibility that my gf might be selling it online. back at home, we have place to archive open mails, receipts, bills and other important documents except for our social and other personal items. there were 6 receipts in total, 2 from victoria's secret and 3 from target and 1 from macy's. against my rough counting, she had amassed some 28-30 pairs of new lingerie, including the one at the beginning of april. two of these receipts had karen's name on it (my gf's elder sister), i believe karen has some kind of rewards card from vs. that itself accounts for 40% of her new purchases. till now i thought she had probably purchased 15 pairs, give or take. i don't wanna invade her privacy by sneaking her bank statements, because that would be a bit over the line. i cannot believe that she spent $1100+ on lingerie over past 45 days. that by itself is so fucking unusual. it's also odd that she hasn't paid using our red card at target (we have target app on our phones). i am calling my brother over to get some clarity. i don't know if it would be right to login to her laptop and see her browsing history to confirm if she's selling her underwear online. i am just numbed atm.

**update 5**: i spoke to my brother and saw some of your comments. i've decided to confront her in-person when she's back home. i don't wanna take any chances or let any form of miscommunication trigger chain reactions for questions that might be unwarranted to her.

**update 6**: you know you have one of those days when all the hell breaks loose and this was one for me. i skipped lunch break phone call in hopes i can talk to my gf when she gets back home. spoke to karen and her mom in the meantime to ensure if she isn't in some kind of financial mess or other kind of trouble. but it takes one fucking truth to destroy it all. you guys, my gf saw this post at work and she immediately knew it was me posting it here. i didn't realize this, leaving rest of her day off. some 4 hours ago my gf confessed that she was sleeping with some guy she met at her work gym. since the beginning of march. fuck me. 

she met this guy at her work gym some 8 months ago. this guy is not even from her workplace, he works at this other startup, in a different building of this corporate park. she said things got all heated up late february after one afternoon. i fucking though she stopped going to gym owing to her hectic schedule after her promotion late november. but there she was, going to gym all along. from the day she started sleeping with this guy, she told her coworkers she has switched gyms across the street. i haven't even cared to ask where they did it. the missing underwear: this is so messed up. sick. she had this realization midway in march that this was wrong. i don't know why i never saw this side of her but she began buying new underwear and throwing it off **as some fucking guilt ritual**. she said she couldn't get off that guilt of wearing the same underwear in bed with me as she worn hours earlier sleeping with that mf. do you know how disgusting that feels? who fucking does this - throw underwear because you want tp dust off guilt from having it worn during sex with a guy you've met and barely known? i was stand still, but i held up for the moment. she says she was confused and that she has backed away from this guy's advances since past one week. i don't believe any word of it. in fact i don't think i wanna believe what she's said. also, the ""tossing her underwear at workplace"" was an excuse - yes, because back then i was driving and she didn't know how to react or what to say, so she made that excuse up. and here i was worrying whole day what it could be.

i later called karen because we were both emotionally drained. i didn't even wait a bit after she arrived. even karen was shocked by the ramble. she later called me, because i had already left them in our apartment. it took me a while to get my thinking right and call my brother. i'll be crashing at his house for now. 

honestly i don't even wanna see her face ever. how can someone lie so perfectly? how can someone be so cold that they show no emotional change or discomfort when sleeping with two people??? wtf - she slept with me hours after she slept with that idiot? and throwing underwear was her means to get over that guilt. i don't understand her anymore. when she said it was all carnal, i didn't even know she believed in notion of sleeping around with people for physical needs. she said she still loves me and this was just something that made her feel good. i don't even know what to interpret of that. honestly i think my thoughts are all over the place. but thank you - i don't know if i could have known about this if it wasn't for this post. it was after dinner did i realize that was trending on this sub, and this post made her take the mid-day train back home. i have so many questions. part of me wants to see her again just to make sure she is alright. part of me doesn't want to see her ever again. i have so many questions but i just avoided her by walking downstairs in no time. i had to ask my brother and his wife to pick some stuff off from home. shit this is all messed up.

"never buy a wyndam ""ownership"". today my sister convinced me to go to one of these timeshare meetings to get free tickets so we could all go to dinner theater. i do not recommend this. while i was smart enough to say no to this insane ""program,"" there were tons of people around me signing up. there was a troubling number of disabled people in the room. just buy the tickets. 

to break it down, you get 200,000 ""points"" per year for $50,000. what does 200,000 equal? 

""it's different everywhere but if you don't go during peak season you can go for two months and you can even rent your space!"" this was a lie. 

they wanted us to pay a $15,000 deposit today and finance the rest in house for 17.99%. for those keeping up at home, you are paying roughly $150,000 for points for life, plus a yearly maintenance fee, for which they could not project into the future. i asked if they could show me how much it has risen in the last few years and where they project it to be, and they wouldn't provide me with any of that. ""it won't rise exponentially.""

this whole situation pissed me off. they asked us to not lie and be open minded, but constantly lied to us. they use every shitty sales tactic in the book. they shame you for choosing to be a renter instead of an owner. they change the location of your meeting constantly. they changed sales reps multiple times. they would not accept no for an answer. i showed them that it would be ~~$150,000~~ $80,000 in 10 years and he kept repeating ""it's $50,000"" over and over again. 

think of the tricks michael uses in the office:

""do you want your life to get better, worse, or stay the same?""

i get home and log into ebay and see that these $50,000 memberships can be bought for literally $1. 

the whole experience was horrifying. they prey on the uneducated and those with special needs.

edit 2: i'm so happy that this post blew up on /r/personalfinance. we went to dinner theater and my 7 year old niece had an incredible time and it made the bullshit 100% worth it. honestly though, i should have just bought my tickets. the 2 hours promised turned into 4 hours. i was belittled, shamed, and insulted.

as some have pointed out there are **rare** situations where timeshares are worth it, especially if the maintenance fees are fixed. for the most part, it's $50k-100k of revenue for the hotel groups that is pure profit. if you are stuck in a timeshare you hate getout! if you aren't, count your blessings and *gasp* rent your hotel rooms, use your credit card rewards, or use airbnb.

"if your neighbors aren't home and a courier leaves their package with you that needs to be signed for, sign your address, not your name. that way the person who owns that package can see the signature online and go to your house to collect it.. i recently ordered a package on line. i was expecting a call/email saying when they expected it to be delivered. i got an email to say my package had been delivered and signed for. true enough there was a signature in the email - but it wasn't mine or my housemates and i didn't recognize it. i spent ages online trying to find a contact number for the courier - no luck so had to drive out to there storage unit 2 days later after work. the gave me a number for a driver who told me he left it in another apartment 5 doors down.

the neighbors gave it to me when knocked on the door (but didn't explain why they hadn't dropped it over to me in the previous 48 hours). i was thinking after that if they had signed they're address as the signature, i would have seen it and been to get the package without any hassle.

edit: this is the signature they provided as proof that my parcel was delivered

edit 2: few people have pointed out that the signature looks like ""100"" when looked at upside. good catch but the complex i am in has number/letter cominations. the apartment number doesn't look anything like that.",8

"i bought a house, 3-days later a man caused over $60k in damages via crashing his car into my house, his insurance company sent an agent who lied about her identity.. lucky me. thankfully i decided to purchase a fantastic insurance policy. damages are over $60k... question for others who may have been in this situation, or could possibly tell me another sub to get advice. my insurance company has been great. the man who hit my house has garbage insurance. my insurance company always alerts me when they are coming or sending anyone. the other day i was checking my security cameras to see if orkin actually came or not, when i saw a lady knocking on the front door. nobody uses the front door because of the extensive damage. my fiance answers and the lady states she is with our home owners insurance and even states the name of our insurance company. i asked my fiance about it to which i get a ""idk i was in the middle of something."" something did not feel right, i email everyone on my team, my claim is under the large loss department, so a fairly large team of about ten people. they all state that they did not send anyone out. i send them the video footage. the subrogation rep on my team dug and found out the lady was from the insurance company of the man who hit my house... why would they lie? should i do something about this? why give false pretenses that are usually indicative of malicious intent? 




i would post the video but i do not want it to be public, it's very clear she is pretending.

"when a guy asked me out and i started crying. before i start this: yes, i know that i am a mess. 

so this is kinda also an update to my last post(https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/dz2kku/someone_noticed_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)but for anyone who doesn't want to go read it, here's the gist of it: 

i've been through some stuff and now have a lot of anxiety and self esteem issues that i am working through because of it, so i haven't really been focusing on dating at all. but then, today this guy in the office building where i work started talking to me and was flirty and such and i was really flattered and happy because guys don't normally talk to me like that.

so here's the update and the fu: i went down to the buildings cafeteria for lunch, and i saw him sitting at one of the tables with his coworkers. he waved me over, so i went over and we were talking a bit, and at one point we were joking about him paying for the lunch i had just bought, and he very slyly was like ""maybe i could just take you on a proper date instead"" or something like that. 

so here's where the anxiety kicks in. because of past stuff (and because this is happening in front of the table full of his coworkers), i start getting really confused and nervous and i immediately start to think that it's a joke or prank or something. so another thing that happens when i'm ridiculously anxious is i start shaking (which is great). and i can feel that coming on, so when he asks for my number, i put it into his phone and then nope outta there as fast as i can without it being super abrupt. 

i ended up sitting at one of the tables all the way on the other side so i could get myself together, and immediately my eyes started tearing up. just as tears start coming out, the same guy walks over and sits down at the table with me (all great things) and i'm not able to hide from him the fact that i'm low key crying.

basically we talked a little more and he said it wasn't a joke or prank or anything and that he just thought i was ""beautiful"" (also threw me off quite a bit) and he was sorry for asking me in front of everyone but he would like to go out if i was okay with it. 

and i said i was... i just hope i can get my sh*t together before i see him next

tl;dr i got asked out for the first time in basically ever, and i ended up crying because i thought it was a joke or prank 🤠

edit: guys. i did not run away crying. i gave him my number, said bye to him, and walked away then teared up when i was at the table by myself. please stop saying i ran away crying; it's making me feel even weirder than i already do 😂",4
"update: privacy hating landlord. original:  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7bgy1s/new_landlord_hates_privacy_help/

it looks like i'm staying, but i took control of the situation.

not long after posting, it became apparent at work that the length of time i would be needed on this project is significantly lower than outside estimates originally said.  finding new arrangements seemed impossible.  i mentioned what was going on at dinner, and included at the table was the company's lawyer, who i know, who offered to review the lease in an unofficial basis.

wednesday morning, i called police about the stolen curtains because i wanted a paper trail.  they gave me a police report, but were uninterested in speaking to my landlord.  i reported the theft to my insurance, gave them the info on who stole them (texts from landlord), and they said they would be contacting someone in the city.  it's only $200, but it's the point of the thing.

i next bought room dividers, which in no way shape or form can be considered curtains, blinds, etc, but block the windows while still letting in light.  they were only $40 each.  at the same time i searched the whole apartment--vents, lights, etc, and can't find any cameras as someone suggested.

by that time, my friend who is a lawyer called me.  she did a little review of the lease and the local laws.  she said baltimore has really shakey laws on when a landlord can come in.  but pointed out that in my lease there is a clause that says the landlord will notify 48 hours prior to entrance, and will call prior to entering in case of emergency.  she drafted me a letter to send to my landlord.  her name won't appear anywhere, but said it can be on my company's letterhead. the letter details some of my rights as a tenant, quotes the lease and reminds him he is bound by these rules as well.  i signed and sent it immediately.

i had mentioned wanting a security camera, and my company is arranging to have a camera sent that will automatically upload video offsite, work for an hour battery life if the electricity is out, and operates on cellular so it doesn't need wifi.  it will be here tomorrow.

i also made the decision to send my ps4 and my cameras back to my home.  my personal and business laptops i will just keep with me while i am out of the apartment.  this leaves the only real valuables as my tv and the security camera itself.  everything else is books, clothes, and kitchen things. i ordered a sign for outside that says the property is monitored by security cameras, and got a jam for the door that holds it closed while i am inside.

i'm prepared for the landlord to make my life hell, but if he breaks the lease my plan is to ask the company to move me into extended stay hotel for the duration of my trip.  it will be more expensive for them, but that's company policy for trips less than four months.  at the moment, i feel as safe as i can in this situation.

updates:  landlord texted me ""sweetie, i didn't think you'd be like this.""

responded: ""i'm not you sweetie, i'm your tenant.  my name is ----.  please use it.""",2
"woman claiming to own our property gave us a handwritten eviction notice ky. to preface this:

my dad was gifted the house and property that we currently live on by his mother in 1991, it's right below where her house used to sit. she died in 2006 and a woman and her husband bought her house in 2010 and claimed they bought our property as well. my dad informed her that he had owned the property since 1991 and had proof, then took her to court. in court, she did not hire a lawyer and tried to represent herself. the judge told her that she couldn't claim rights to our house because she didn't buy it or own it.

earlier today, she left a handwritten note on our door that said:

""i have a buyer for this property and you have 30 days to evict the premises.""

we're speaking to our lawyer tomorrow, but i am very stressed about it right now and am wondering if she has any chance of being able to evict us? 

thanks for any responses.

edit: i made a few calls this morning to some local offices. it is for sure that we own the home on the land but there's no document of who owns the property. the lady i spoke to said, ""there was a deed and then just wasn't"" so we're going to a deed office today to clear it up. 

edit 2: here is the letter:

""mrs. my mom's name, i, crazy neighbor, owner of the property, is giving you 30 days to evict the premises. we are in the process of selling the property and already have a buyer.""

edit 3: we spoke to some people this morning and apparently it's still very muddy what happened. as far as we can tell, there was a mix-up somewhere between my father receiving the deed from his mother and the crazy neighbor buying the property above us. at this point it seems the best option is to lawyer up.

"the non-panicked layoff. two weeks ago life was simple. i could go to the grocery store and pick out whatever i wanted without looking at the price tag. i could peruse a department store for new heels that matched my new dress guilt free. i could even cover a large and unexpected card repair without a single negative emotion entering the equation. i was making plenty of money for a young single adult to live on, and i was comfortable and carefree. 

and then i wasn't. all it took was one email with one simple message, ""you are being laid off"" to cause my heart to feel like it dropped through my feet and my brain to run amok with the thought of  ""oh sh*t."" but the panic was brief, and thanks to a number of years on this sub (obviously not on this throwaway account ) i was well prepared for the moment.

the first thing i did was to check my financial status and was thrilled to find that by having money get auto deducted from my paid check for an emergency fund, i had managed to save over 6 months of expenses in just a few years! it also helped that i spent my late teens/early 20s on this site and learned to keep lifestyle inflation in check while my income grew.

the second thing i did was file for unemployment. i was getting no severance and was not owed any vacation. this sub convinced me that taking unemployment was not something to be ashamed of. i earned it. 

the third thing i did was apply to jobs. i am still on this third step, but am happy to report that i am nearly as comfortable and carefree as i was two weeks ago. i know i have the means to support myself for quite some time and can take the time to apply to cool sounding jobs, take hikes in the mountains (the trees are so colorful this time of year!) and enjoy a nice respite from the 9-5 grind. 

so, thank you. your discussions, questions, and advice on this sub over the past few years led me to having financial security when i needed it the most.

"a judge refused to marry me due to how i look.. i'm 22 and so is my fiance. i was in a bit of a jam after losing my job and thus my health insurance, so we decided to just get married earlier than anticipated in order to get on my fiance's health plan. for some context, i have turner syndrome so i have a very child-like appearance, and i was doing some treatments with my doctors that can only be covered with insurance.

we planned to marry in our state, nj but the requirement was we needed a witness...which neither of us have any offline friends and neither of our families approve of our relationship so we decided to marry in pennsylvania since it is more lax with marriage requirements.

so we get the license and set a date at a courthouse. we go there, and like many other times in my life, the people around were horrified at the prospect of a ""child"" getting married. i provided adequate proof that i am over 18. the judge takes one look at us and he is clearly repulsed. he refuses to marry us, and basically told my fiance he should be ""ashamed"". 

is it legal that he refused to marry us? we were treated pretty badly and with disrespect. the clerk also assured us nobody was going to be interested in marrying us so we should just not try again. is there any way we can compel a judge to marry us? we are originally from nj, trying to marry in pa.",2
"(utah) my dad keeps getting scammed, doesn't believe anyone, has ruined he and my moms lives, can we stop him from sending more money?.  

tl;dr: my dad has been scammed multiple times even though we've told him it was a scam. he is either being blackmailed or is mentally ill. is there anything my mom/me/my siblings do.

a bit of background about my dad, because i feel like its relevant. my dad isn't a smart guy, he is very trusting and has taken what his friends have told him over his family.

about a year and a half ago my mom thought my dad had a ""girlfriend"". well we found out he was actually being scammed with the usual egyptian prince scam. he thought he had married and gave her about $100,000 to help her get her inheritance. my dad had taken some of the documents to my brother and asked him if he thought they were real and he told him they weren't. he still wired the money. my dad had this woman call and talk to my mom to try and convince her that she wasn't really my dad's wife or girlfriend, that she really just wanted to be part of our family and give them money. 

we all sat down (my siblings, my parents and i) and laid out to my dad that he was scammed and he wouldn't be getting any money back etc. he broke his phone (why? no idea when he could have just changed his number). he bought a new phone and changed his phone number. we all thought that was the end, until in january my dad called and told me that he had continued to send this woman money, totaling about $300,000. 

here is where things get absolutely insane. my brother and i meet with my mom at his house and start getting the rundown of what the hell happened here. my mom said that even though we all told him he was being scammed he didn't believe us at all. my mom kept telling him he was being scammed and he would tell her that he couldn't wait to get his money so he could laugh in all of our faces. at some point these people and my dad convinced my mom for a while that it wasn't a scam. my dad cashed out all of his stocks, his sweet coin collection, pawned all of this guns (including a nice rifle that had belonged to my great grandpa). he convinced my mom to get a second mortgage because they were about to be rich. my parents paid off their brand new truck and travel trailer. my mom dipped into her 401k. they totally wiped out all of the savings they had. when the money didn't come my mom told my dad she was 100% done and that he was being scammed.

this didn't stop my dad. he used the titles of the truck and trailer to borrow against them. he borrowed $10,000 from his best friend. he then maxed out all of his credit cards buying gift cards and did the same to my moms credit cards. when my mom got her statements that's when she found out that he was still giving them money. she told him he better tell us kids or she would do it. so he called us and told us. he seemed to really believe that he had been scammed this time. we were all super duper mad because he ruined not only his life but my moms too. they have to file bankruptcy and lose everything they've ever wanted.

time went on and i was sort of trying to forgive my dad a bit because i do love him. my mom called me and told me that my dad was telling one of his clients about being scammed and she knew someone who had been scammed and had some of it recovered and my dad got the guys contact information and was in the process to see if this guy could help them too. my mom was so excited about it she told my sister on her birthday and asked me not to tell her before.

flash forward to last monday, my dad called my husband asking him if he could come down and help fix his computer, that microsoft tech support called and showed him all this stuff wrong with his computer. my husband asked if he installed anything and he said no, but he let them remote into his computer. my husband told him to turn it off. we went over to their house so my husband could look at it. he's trying to see if he can just clean it out and avoid reformatting.

while my husband was waiting for stuff to run he notices an email from ""alex"" and can tell immediately it's another scam. he looks at the website he sent in the email, so fake!! i could tell as soon as he showed me. so he calls my dad outside and shows him how fake it is. my dad asks extremely surprised at this information, my husband explained to him how he's on a suckers list now and that any real recovery company can't ask for money for 7 days after the money has been recovered and my dad had already given them $5,000 from his business checking account, the fake website had fields for bank account numbers and routing numbers, that he put in. my dad came inside and told my mom that the website was fake. my mom had a very nonchalant attitude about it and said ""oh well, nothing we can do about it now"". there was no way my husband was going to be able to recover his computer so we decided to take it home to reformat it.

my husband looked through his emails to make sure there wasn't anything else he was potentially getting scammed on. here's a few highlights:

the arrest form the recovery scam sent was completely blank.

he thought was going to get back 2 million dollars even though he only lost $300,000.

the documents the guys were sending him from the original scam were so bad that you could literally google them. the ceo of bank of america wasn't even the same person anymore and his name wasn't even spelled correctly. the dates were written european style on and on.

my dad sent 3 brand new iphone xr's tip top of the line to someone in south africa.

he has given them his ssn, a picture of his driver's license, his parents full names, his grandparents full names and a picture of his whole passport.

here's the kicker… before my dad sent the recovery scammer money he asked my brother what he thought and my brother told him the same exact thing my husband told him and he did it anyway.

i called my mom and told her not to believe anything my dad says and to check with my husband in the future. she told me that she knew as soon as they started asking for money that it was a scam but he didn't believe her and at this point she just doesn't care anymore and is just trying to get the bankruptcy pushed through so she can divorce my dad.

i'm worried that my dad is going to do something that is going to hurt their bankruptcy filing by continuing to be scammed, get them in legal trouble some how and give away more money they 100% don't have. is there something my mom can do to take away his ability to make any sort of financial transactions? can she force him to give his phone over and have my husband lock down his computer so he only has access to quick books? is there anything we can do to stop him? my husband thinks he is being blackmailed but i just think he is losing his mind/mentally ill. i just want to protect my mom as much as i can from any further damage.",2
"my neighbors didn't like the color of my house was so they had it painted a different color while i was out of town. so this is a probably a really weird question for me to ask but it's a weird situation and i'm not really sure what i can do. my house is on a corner lot. two years ago a newlywed couple moved in to the one house that's beside mine. right away they started making weird comments about the color my house was painted (yellow) and soon switched to outright demanding that i paint it a different color. my house was painted yellow when it was built it, i like the color and there is no bylaw against it or anything. they have called the police on me about it as well as the city, both of whom told them to pound sound because i hadn't done anything wrong and there was nothing they could do. they also tried suing me in court (the suit was thrown out and they had to pay my legal fees) and getting our other neighbors together to form a home owner's association in the hopes eventually i could be forced to paint my house a different color. our other neighbors also told them to pound sand and they have basically alienated themselves from everyone else in the neighborhood at this point. 

i recently had to go out of town for something. i was gone for two weeks. when i got back two days ago my house was gray. seriously. i actually almost drove past it because i'm so used to my yellow house. i knew immediately who was responsible but when i went over and knocked on their door no one answered. i think the couple figured out that i was away and not just at work when they saw our neighbors collecting my mail for me, because i sure as hell never told them i was going away and i know my other neighbors hate them too and didn't tell them. the neighbor from across the street came over and showed me pictures that he took of the painting company setting up and doing the work. he said he and another neighbor called the police but the painting company had a valid work order and had been paid so the police couldn't do anything. he also told about it but because they were paid to do the work they said they had to do it to avoid being sued. i called the painting company to get a copy of the work order and it was in the name of a ""ms. jane smith"" and was paid for in cash. a redheaded woman and her redheaded husband came to the company to hire them (my neighbors are both redheads) saying they would be out of town and would like their house painted while they were gone. they gave the painting company pictures of my house, taken from the street. 

i have a surveillance camera at my front and side doors and in my backyard because i work shifts and as a woman living alone i don't want some stranger breaking into my house and waiting to ambush me when i get home. my neighbors never set foot on my property at any time so they can't be charged with trespassing and they didn't do the painting (which was actually done properly). when i called the police they re-iterated that since the painters were hired, had a valid work order and were paid to do the job, they can't be charged with trespassing because it was reasonable for them not to know and they were acting in good faith and didn't cause any physical damage to the house. also the neighbors can't be charged with trespassing or vandalism because they didn't come on my property or touch the house themselves. i don't know if i can sue anyone because there was no actual damage or harm done to me or the house. my neighbors still have not answered their door or shown themselves. i am pissed off beyond belief because i liked my yellow house and i can't believe how fucking crazy that they have been. i wish i could show a court or city council how psycho they have been over this. i want to know if i have any recourse or if i can do something to get them to pay to paint the house back to yellow. does anyone know what i can do to get them to fix this and paint it back?

"if i asked for a dna test?. about eight years ago i went to a friend's wedding. while i was there i wound up having a drunken one-night stand with an old friend i went to school with.

the next morning i woke up to her crying, she said she was in a serious relationship and our hookup was a big mistake. i instinctively apologized, but she insisted it was all her fault, and i had no reason to apologize. i gave her my word that i will keep quiet about things, and this would just be our secret.

i've kept my word for years. i never said nothing to anyone, i've actually almost forgot about it myself. 

about a month ago, i was scrolling through facebook when i seen something that shook my whole world up. i seen a picture of my daughter sitting on some random guy's lap. after a doubletake and a thorough inspection, i realized this was not my daughter. i realized that it was my old friend's husband and their daughter.

the resemblance is uncanny those girls are almost twins. the math adds up and, my thoughts have been driving me crazy for a month now. i want to say something, i feel like i need to know the truth. i need to put my mind to rest. i don't want to break a family, but after my mom passed away, i found out that me and my children are at high risk for colon cancer. if she is my child, i feel like this is something she needs to know.

edit: if i found out she was mine, i would most definitely want to be a part of her life. what kind of man would i be if i didn't? i agreed to keep her infidelity a secret, i never agreed to let another man raise my child. 

i feel guilty, because the two of them look so happy in that picture. i would hate to spoil the relationship between those two. i couldn't imagine if i found out my daughter wasn't mine.  but at the same time i can't imagine missing out on my child's life.",3

since i've moved in, every month my roommate tells me the cost for my half of the utilities bill. it is in her name and she told me it's easier that way and i figured yes it would be easier to just give her my half. and i always pay on time. at first i didn't question it, but then i started to ask her for a copy of the bill. 114-140 seemed like quite a bit compared to what i overheard friends were paying. but she never actually printed, scanned or emailed the copy of the bill like she said she would. still naive i payed anyways because i love my room and my situation and work hard for this beautiful place. here's the part that bites, the first 3 months i payed her through paypal so that's documented. the rest of the months i paid in cash because when you're in the service industry living off tips, sometimes you don't want to make constant deposits. it was easier that's all. so unfortunately i have paid 7 months of utilities bill in cash ranging from $114-$150 (that's supposed to be my half). for this past january i was traveling out of state for 2 whole weeks. i remember wondering why it felt so long i had paid my roommate for the utilities bill. then finally february 9th i am asked to pay $212 for the utilities bill. perplexed, i asked how that was possible (she is a c*nt and turns off the heater behind my back after i turn it on and i have pictures of the thermostat when it's 60 degrees). mind you, being gone for 2 weeks and she is never wanting the heater on when i want it on so i had to buy my own space heater for my room because it gets freezing cold. i asked her, so you're saying the total bill was 400 between the two of us? she said yes. looking back of course i should have known better but she is a wolf in sheep's clothing. i asked her for the copy of the bill, more than once and never got it. she text me saying please leave cash on counter and i asked again, she said she would and didn't, so when she got home i had the money ready for her but asked to see the bill so she sent me a picture of the screenshot of the balance of our gas and electric account. it wasn't enough information so i asked her to email me the bill. she did not, she emailed me the screenshot. i didn't want her to think i wasn't trying to not pay the bill and cause problems. so i payed her in cash $212... but it didn't sit right with me. so today i asked her to get her laptop and show me the utilities history. her hand was trembling as she scrolled through to show me the bill. and...i have been paying the entire bill between the both of us since i moved in. so when i paid $140 i should have paid $70. and that $212? well she didn't pay the month of december and remember how i said i felt like it had been awhile since i paid her? well i was paying for december and january in its entirety. i'm so upset as you can imagine. i can't explain the pain my feet are in after work everyday after being on my feet for hours and realizing how i don't have receipts of my cash payments to her kills me because i may not be able to hold up in court. is it possible i can still find a way to sue her or get my half of the bills back? please help.

we get ahead and this crazy person steps on the gas to pass us.  as they pass us, my husband and i look over and see a nasty, rat faced blonde woman flip us off and make ""chinese eyes"".  

now my husband is white, french.  and he is driving.  he never tailgated this ugly woman or did anything to make her want to mess with us. 

the only motive we came up with for this interaction was racism (because of the ""eye slanting gesture"").  i mean, i'm the only full blooded asian in the car.  she couldn't have seen my half asian kids asleep in the back seat.  and since i'm just a passenger, i couldn't have done anything to offend her.  yet she singled me out with a racist gesture. 

since she put my family's life in danger with her crazy driving, and followed it up with unnecessary hate, i called 911 and reported her weird little shrew face to the highway patrol as a drunk driver.

i hope she had a couple glasses of wine or something.  or maybe that she mouths off to a poc cop and gets arrested.  or gets into an accident pulling this childish crap to someone else.  i hate racists.  

edit: i called the cops out of anger and called her a drunk.  it's easy for me to hide behind the ""well she was acting crazy maybe she was drunk"" excuse.   

this is a confession because i did something bad and i don't regret it.  even if she wasn't drunk and gets pulled over...maybe she'll think twice next time.  she can take her hate and find another outlet. ",11

"by thinking a hot girl on tinder was a catfish. technically yesterday lol. 

i get a message on tinder saying ""hey cutieee"", being an average looking dude i got pretty excited and checked her profile, it was completely empty. not a single picture.

wtf is this shit i thought, so i tell her to upload a picture, a few minutes a picture of this sexy light skin middle eastern girl with blue eyes goes up. as if that wasn't enough the pic was blurry as fuck. this is complete bullshit i thought, but since ""shes"" hot i have to make sure.

we add each other on snapchat, i ask her to send me a picture with two fingers up, she sends me a pic of just her face. i said ""noooo, fingers up"" she's gets defensive and tells me not to tell her what to do, at this point it's basically confirmed that she's a 300 pound man named tyrone. i call him/her out and he/she unfriends me.

it turns out when someone unfriends you on snapchat you can still see their stories. i check his. it's not tyrone. it's her. she's on a date. a date with a dude who looks just like me. i was her type.

"my job just had me strain fruit flies out of alcohol & put the liquor back into the bottles, is this legal?. i've had this throwaway for a while & figured i should use it for this.  i work as a bartender, just started 2 months ago.  my work has a fruit fly problem, & just like the title says, about an hour ago my manager had me strain out all the fruit flies from the liquor & pour it back into the bottles.  it made me really uncomfortable because it feels extremely unsanitary.  is this allowed?  i'm in virginia.  tagging as employment law because i don't know where this falls but i'll change it if necessary.

edit:  sorry guys, i just got off work so now i can write more.  i made this post in a rush right after this happened & left out some stuff you all have asked about.  i should have asked where to report this because i knew it at least violated health codes, i was just wondering if it also violates abc laws too (which i've learned it does).  i'll be reporting to both agencies & telling them about what happened as well as other things that i've seen around my workplace that definitely aren't allowed under health codes.  the bottles have pour spouts on them with rubber caps to prevent bugs from getting in (because it was an issue before i arrived) but they somehow got in possibly through the tiny hole meant to let air escape.  in the past i have been told to hand over bottles with bugs in them & they're added to spoilage, but this was 12-15 bottles so i think they were afraid writing off that much liquor would raise attention to their untreated bug problem, leading them to do what they did.  like i said, i'll be reporting everything under my real name & all, i intend to see this through because it's so gross & wrong.  as i mentioned in the comments, there should be video evidence from the camera covering the bar, so i'll give them time stamps as well.  i'm not worried about management finding out it was me because 1) i've expressed my concerns about other stuff before & shortly put in my 2 weeks when i was chastised for doing so, so they'll likely know it's me right away & 2) management already hates me because i expressed my concerns & my last day is coming up in less than a week so i don't give a fuck at this point.  thanks for the advice everyone, the links & information is greatly appreciated.

edit ii:  rip my inbox.  some of y'all are nasty, saying a lot of bars do this & i need to get over it if i want to survive in this business.  i can't believe there are bartenders complicit with this.  most of you have been helpful though, suggesting ways to get rid of fruit flies with traps.  unfortunately, i've already tried putting out a couple traps behind the bar but, but my manager made me get rid of them because they were ""unsightly.""  i'm going through with the reporting stuff today & i'll update in due time if anything actually happens.  thanks for the advice everyone.",2
"for trying to contact my husband through the means that are available to me?. my husband never charges his phone.  if i have to reach him during the day, i just can't.  he gives people my phone number if they need to reach him.  sometimes i need to reach him (sick child at school, etc.). sometimes he is home while i am at work.  so i always try his phone first (never charged).  then sometimes i drop in on one of the alexas in the house or the furbo dog camera.  i usually just say, ""hi husband, give me a call when you get a chance.""  today,  i knew our daughter was having friends over and wanted to discuss those plans since he was to be in charge at home.  called the phone, phone is dead.  i figured he was on his computer, so i sent a video message to his computer.  he called me back, and boy was he pissed.  he said he was sick of me spying on him with all of my cameras.  he went on at some length about me spying on him.  i'm not.  i don't give a shit what he does at home.  anyway he was so mean to me on the phone that i cried for about 15 minutes.  then when i got home it continued.  him yelling at me about spying on him.  i'm really not.  i'm just trying to get in touch with him however i can because he refuses to charge his phone.  i'm still upset about him yelling at me, crying on and off all afternoon.  anyway thanks for reading.
edit:  just to be clear, i only contact him if i have to:  e.g., sick child, after school plans, flat tire.  i'm not calling him excessively or spying on him.  i don't need to spy on him.  he sleeps, eats and watches tv.",3
"update - for not throwing away pictures of my ex wife?. it's been a bit over a week since my post here made front page, and it's taken about that much time to finish reading through the responses.  you're answers were overwhelmingly positive (save for a few), and today i finally solidified my position and pulled the trigger. 

first the good - when i returned home, i searched the box that i had hid the pictures and scrapbook to find that they were gone. upon inquiring of their whereabouts, i was directed under a bathroom sink. there i found the remains of the scrapbook, mostly put back together. however, i realized that at least 2 pages were missing. i also noticed that a few pictures in question weren't present. upon questioning, i was directed to a trash can, where i found a couple torn pictures. still, to my dismay, i found that the contents of the ravaged scrapbook were still incomplete. further investigation revealed another stash of torn pictures. finally, i have attained all of the pictures. (shout out to the private messages offering to reconstruct them. a massive thanks to you!)

two more days passed and i demanded that she apologize to my daughter for destroying the scrapbook (which now resides in my daughters room). apology accepted, now comes the hard part. 

i wont bother lying to you all, for i fear you would see through me. i considered trying to work through it. i thought, perhaps her efforts to repair the scrapbook are worthy of forgiveness? 

nay!

seriously guys. i cant thank you enough. if it weren't for your guidance, i would probably continue to expose my daughter to this woman. our relationship has ended, and i am now focused solely on raising my beautiful baby girl and my career.

"who is the asshole? brother upset i am not taking on childcare duties when we live together.. my brother howard 32m and i 24f are renting a house from our father. originally it was just me and a cousin, but howard moved in when she left. howard and his wife, janis, have two kids. my niece 5f and nephew 2m spend half the week with one parent, and half the week with the other. howard has them from friday to monday morning. 

the current problem—

i have tried to talk to my brother about his expectations of ""help"" and that i find them unreasonable. i am not the second parent in the household, i view us living together as roommates, not really a family unit. i am here until i finish school and can move out on my own. 

he wants to go to the gym or go out with friends, but the times he wants to go are during my only free time. i feel like i shouldn't be asked to give up my free time when babysitters are available for that kind of thing--he is just too cheap to hire one. his argument, that he would do the same for me, is empty. i don't plan to have kids. he has insulted me for not dropping everything to watch his kids, calling me ""selfish"" and ""shallow"" for not helping him out. 

howard says-- 

i have an issue with my sister not helping because we live together and we should, as a family, be willing to help when need be. i feel like she has done very little to help with the kids. 

she makes her own meals, but she doesn't offer to help make meals for the kids. she is not home much, but when she is, she will order something small to the house and not ask if i want anything i will give her $$$. 

when i ask her to help me get the kids ready for something, she tells me no. we have gotten into arguments because she will see i am trying to get the kids ready and she just leaves, without even asking if i am okay. 

i need to get away from the kids sometimes. i have asked her to watch the kids while i get milk from the store. she says she will pick up the milk for me. when i tell her i need a minute alone, she says the offer is ""i get the milk or nothing."" 

i am drowning in debt, i have a failing marriage, my kids are a lot, and my parents live far away. i just need some help and she has refused to be more than a passing stranger in their lives. i am hurt, overwhelmed, and resentful—which i don't want to be. but i feel like she could help more, or even a little bit. 

our dad has a pool in the back. she swims laps every morning. it was 90* here the other day and the kids wanted to swim. i had to take calls and asked if she would watch them for 20 minutes. she said, no she was finishing laps, making breakfast, and going out with friends. so she didn't have time. i would desperately like some help. 

conclusion—

we both think we are right and cannot think of a way to make the other person understand. thanks for the help

"personal finance ""loopholes"", updated. a lot of personal finance advice is straightforward applications of math: keep expenses less than income.  pay off highest interest rate debts first.  compound growth is your friend.

then there are obvious legal requirements and benefits:   use tax-preferred retirement / hsa accounts.  keep insurance in force.   know how self-employment taxes work. 

this post is about less-obvious ways to use ""loopholes"" / little-known benefits in existing us laws to your advantage.   (our friends in other countries are welcome to lobby for local versions *in their associated personal finance subs*.)

here are some that you may not already know about:

taxes / tax planning:

- take advantage of ""adjustments(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/cut-your-taxes-without-itemizing-1.aspx)"" like ira/hsa contributions,  student loan interest, tuition, moving costs, self-employment taxes/healh insurance paid,etc., to reduce taxable income if you are eligible.  you can take these even if you do not otherwise itemize.

- if you are not a full-time student and earn less than 30k single / 60k jointly, you can use the saver's credit(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-savings-contributions-savers-credit) to get a tax credit (better than a deduction!) for a portion of your ira or 401k contributions, even for roth contributions.  you can even deduct a contribution to get your income to qualify.  

- gifts and inheritances are generally not taxable to the recipient.  other untaxed ""income"" includes most insurance payouts and damage awards; child support; some scholarships; rebates and loyalty program bonuses.  remember that loans are not income, though forgiven loans typically are.  

- you pay no taxes at all on long-term capital gains(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/no-capital-gains-due-for-some-investors-1.aspx) if your taxable income (including those gains) is less than the top of the 15% tax bracket.  that could be $95,000 gross income for a married couple filing jointly.  you can can do this at any age.

- sales of a personal residence often have no capital gains tax(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/taxes/capital-gains-and-your-home-sale-1.aspx) as well.  you have to have lived in the house as your primary residence two of the past five years; you get $250,000 per sale ($500,000 for a couple).   

- if you rent a room in your house, part of all of your housing expenses (including insurance and utilities) can be schedule e expense deductions against your rental income(http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/tax-issues-when-renting-out-room-your-house.html) (but you need to declare the rental income.)  you don't have taxable income / deductions if your roommates who share the lease give you money to send to your  landlord.  

- if you received a 1099 reporting income that wasn't really yours , e.g. for selling something on behalf of someone else, use a nominee distribution(http://www.arahcpa.com/blog/don8217t-forget-those-nominee-1099s/36087) declaration to avoid being taxed on it.

- if your spouse owes money to the federal government, use an injured spouse(https://www.irs.gov/irm/part25/irm_25-018-005.html) form to keep the irs from withholding your share of a joint tax refund.  this is different than an innocent spouse(https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc205.html) situation, where your spouse tried to evade taxes without your knowledge.

retirement:

- think you make too much to contribute to roth ira?  think again!  the backdoor roth ira(https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/backdoor-roth-ira-high-income-how-to-guide/) may work for you.  there's even a mega-backdoor roth(http://www.madfientist.com/after-tax-contributions/) for high-income people with certain 401k plans.

- employer contributions to your 401k don't count(http://www.bankrate.com/finance/retirement/employer-match-counts-toward-401k-limit.aspx) against the 18k limit.  

- if you change you mind about making an ira contribution, e.g. your income becomes too high for it to be deductible, you can simply remove the money(https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution) before the tax filing deadline without penalty.

- self-employed people have lots of options(https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-for-self-employed-people) for retirement accounts, including a solo-401k and a sep ira.  this can apply even if you have employment retirement savings.

health insurance:

- if you change jobs and don't have insurance coverage for a time, you have 60 days to elect continuing (cobra) coverage, during which time you are eligible to be covered even if you haven't and won't pay for it.  this works retroactively(http://www.mymoneyblog.com/cobra-and-retroactive-health-insurance-coverage.html); you can decide to take cobra at day 59 if you do have major expenses, pay for it, and be covered for the previous 59 days.  

- you won't pay a penalty for lack of health insurance if you have a single  brief coverage gap(http://obamacarefacts.com/obamacare-coverage-gap-exemption/), which is defined as ""less than three months.""  i.e. may 3 to july 31 is ok.  may 1 to july 31 is not.

"what is the velocity of the edge of a bubble as it is ""popping""?. take a bubble - soap/water, milk or otherwise - and initiate a ""pop"" from a single point on the surface. what would be the velocity of the bursting edge, as it propagates away from the initiation point?

here is a video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blne2ae5a2c) of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.

for simplicity, assume a *perfect bubble*:

- perfectly spherical
- evenly distributed surface
- no external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)
- ""pop"" or burst initiated from a single point on the surface

it seems intuitive that the *upper limit* would be the **speed of sound** for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping. but i'm unsure what role the pressure differential(https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/127695/why-is-the-pressure-inside-a-soap-bubble-higher-than-outside) might play - if any at all.",9

(i should add the cat was nowhere near her rabbits. he is just a very friendly cat and was coming to greet the neighbors.) then the grandson hops up on my porch picks up a large plastic bowl my kids left out and starts whacking my cat in the head with it. his grandmother was watching the entire time and said nothing. 

i caught the entire thing on my nest cam. i wasn't home at the time or i would have confronted them as it happened. what should i do? should i even try to call the police?

edit: called the police. showed them the video. they said the boy's actions were not ok, but filing a report would basically amount to nothing. they did offer to go speak with them. my husband walked outside and heard the lady yelling at the police officer.

"i pretended to be sick to use my insurance to get my uninsured friend medication. part of my insurance comes with free telemedicine consults with a doctor. this happens over video chat via a smartphone app or a website. basically you just video chat with the doc, give your symptoms, maybe give your temperature if you have a thermometer and they give you a diagnosis and prescription if needed. works great for the simple stuff. 

&#x200b;

a friend of mine more than likely has a sinus infection. due to an issue with his sinuses (he hopes to have surgery one day to help but he needs insurance first) it's pretty common for him at a few times a year not having insurance a doc would cost him at least $99 through the area clinics plus who knows how much for the medicine if it's not a generic. he's a good guy in a tough financial spot right now, and he can swing $99 but it will sting.

fuck it. i had him tell me all his symptoms and what happened and then popped on this telemedicine thing saying that. i got a script and just filled it. free consult and with my insurance $2 for the medicine. he'll buy me a cheap beer when he's better.

"i work at a skilled nursing facility. if you know someone on medicare, please read.. please read this if you have a friend or family member that it medicare eligible. it could save them from paying a bill they do not owe. 
i spent the day at an educational seminar on medicare billing. 
on october 1st of this year (2 weeks from now), medicare will be drastically changing the way they pay bills for medicare services, and this includes medicare advantage plans. 

the seminar i attended was for skilled nursing rehabilitation services (i.e. inpatient therapy for a broken hip). 

as with anything medicare rolls out, it is convoluted, redundant and nonsensical. most facilities have done little training (or as much as they could), ours was today, and we have to start documenting on it next week. 
the charting on skilled nursing patients has to be on point, and in many cases, if nursing and therapy services don't document properly, even something minor can trigger a rejection. 

it is the majority of facilities standard practice, or sometimes even an automated one, to issue a bill as soon as insurance or medicare issues a denial. this means your family member could possibly receive a bill because of an error on the facility's part, or on medicare's part. 

most places will try and correct the issue and resubmit, and that will generally fix the problem. 

however, there are two issues:
one, if the process is automated, it may take them several days to find the issue (as i said, the process is new and convoluted), then several days for the billing department to resubmit, then several more days for medicare to approve, if they choose not to audit the charges, if they do, it could be longer. 

this leads to the second problem. 
my grandparents do not generally let bills sit around for long. even if they do not pay the whole amount, they pay something. if medicare eventually pays the claim, any payment they put toward the bill will now have to be refunded by the facility. they would have to wait for the medicare statement to prove the claim was paid, then go through the refund process with the facility billing office. most facilities are not locally owned, so this would likely have to be done through email or over the phone. 

our grandparents are in their late eighties and are on a fixed income. if they even realized they overpaid a bill, they would have no idea where to begin to start the refund process. they would likely chalk it up to a loss, but for some, the money they lose could mean groceries for a week. 

the process will eventually even out and become our routine, but it could take several months. please speak to your friends and family who receive medicare/have a medicare advantage plan. let them know to put medical bills aside for you to review before they pay, and to let you know if they receive any medicare denial notifications. ask them to put them aside so you can review them, and before anything is paid, if something stands out, call the medicare/insurance office, facility or hospital and verify what was paid and what was not, and if something wasn't paid, ask of the appeal process was initiated by the facility. 

i know my facility, and most others, are educating the billing, administration, therapy and nursing staff as much as they can to make sure issues are kept at a minimum. 
let's be honest, though, it's a new system. the rollout is going across the entire united states, all at once. somewhere, someone has no idea what they're doing. somewhere, someone is going to go to work on october 1st, not having any idea what they're supposed to do. somewhere, someone is going to screw up royally and cause a whole lot of people a whole lot of headaches. 

also, if you know a mds nurse, give them a hug on october 2nd. if you have some wine available, and some tissues, they probably won't mind that, either.",10

i get that it's not just gay men that do this and nobody should put up with it regardless of gender. the problem i have is that gay men can do it in any setting and people just think it's funny.

"not being married with kids later in life is nothing to be ashamed of, and people who criticize single older people are shallow and insensitive.. aggressive edit: to all you people saying ""op you're lame this is too popular to exist"", before this got popular this post was a cesspool of disagreement and agreement alike. because reddit is made up of a ton of nerds and outcasts, of course there will be a lot of people who think this way. that's not how most of society views it though, so don't be fooled by what the user base deems popular on this one website. peace 😎.

marriage and relationships in general are not for everyone. i'll use myself as an example. for work, i am on call 24/6 with a minimum of 8 hours rest between shifts. i get one day off per week and i don't know what that day will be until the prior week. if i were married or in a relationship with that kind of schedule, the relationship would be greatly strained. not to mention my kids, if i had any, would not have a dad for much of their childhood. it wouldn't be fair to them to be skimped out of experiences because i always had to work.

despite that, i can't tell you how many times i've been criticized for not having a family or spouse at my age. look, not everyone has to conform to societal norms. i love my job and i don't want to go through heartbreak and depression because i tried to be a typical american family man and it didn't work out. it's very shallow of other people to think this when they are not in my shoes. i'm trying to think of what is best for myself and a possible family, so don't sit there and say ""you'll regret it later on in life"". people need to mind their own business and respect other people's decisions.

i was bumming pretty hard today from our chat last night and was bored. so why not flick the bean, right? i started thinking about him while getting things going. what i wasn't aware of, was that my phone was underneath me. i don't know if the little ai assistant that lives in my phone heard me say his name and decided to call him, or if i had hit the ""call last number"" button. either way, once i had finished, i picked up my phone and saw his name across the top of my screen. i had been in a call with him for about 10 minutes. i immediately turned my phone completely off. i have no idea if he picked up and was listening, or if i just left him the lewdest 10 minute voicemail of all time.

it's also just now occurring to me that maybe he called me. but yeah i'm mortified and i don't know how to bring it up, if i should even bring it up. 

tl;dr: buttdialed my crush while masturbating about him. potentially left him a 10 minute porny voicemail.",4
"for kicking a girl out of our body acceptance support group ?. i'm one of the two people in charge of running a body acceptance support group, we hold meetings for free at a community center after closing hours every saturday. we don't have a sign up process, you can just show up, write down your name and sit down to share. we make it clear that our support group is made strictly for people with body deformities, amputations, severe scarring, disfigurations of some sort... it is not for people who struggle with self esteem and need a boost.

at our first august meeting, a girl showed up whom we'll call ashley. there wasn't anything visibly ""wrong"" with ashley, but we didn't give it much thought since in some cases the scarring or whatever else can be hidden underneath clothes. (in my case, a long sleeved shirt hides nearly all of my upper body burn scarring). however, whenever ashley spoke, she would never mention what she was struggling with just that she was disgusted with her body. the first two sessions, i thought it was fine, to each their pace and i didn't want to force her to share anything she wasn't comfortable with sharing. even when we would wrap up the meetings and the members would chat to each other, she didn't reveal what exactly it was that made her seek out our support group.

at our third meeting, ashley showed up wearing a crop top and very short shorts, and again there was nothing visibly ""wrong"". she dodged every question i directed towards her asking about why exactly she was here, asking her if she was a veteran, if she had a surgery... she left quickly when we wrapped up and i couldn't speak with her. other members asked me what the deal with her was since she went on an other tangent about how disgusting her body was when it was her turn to speak without talking about what her physical defect was exactly or how it was impacting her day to day life.

last saturday's meeting, i approached ashley before the meeting to voice my concerns alongside those of the rest of the members. ashley responded saying we weren't very ""nice"", and that whenever she would speak up negatively about her body and such, we would never counter her with a compliment, we would just stay silent or tell her some ""mumbojumbo"" about how it takes time to come to terms with it. i was getting pretty angry, and i directly asked her why is it that she was here, and i told her if she couldn't give me an answer i'm afraid i would have to kick her out. she didn't answer so i asked her to leave. 

she contacted my co-runner (he organizes and plans timings, deals with the community center...) and he seems to think what i did is not justified, and that i shouldn't turn away anyone or kick them out because of the way they grieve or deal with trauma. when i tried to explain that i doubted she had any physical defects to begin with, he shut it down saying i'm being an asshole for judging someone as not ""disabled enough"".

am i the asshole for kicking her out?",3
"caught hoa trying to break into my house. now they've issued me a $1000 fine. wa. i bought a house 18 months ago which was a member of the hoa. i did change the front door of the house to something a lot more secure. 

about a month ago, in the middle of a weekday i noticed two people trying to open the door with keys which weren't working, i confronted them (while my wife called the police) and it became apparent that they were officers of the hoa trying to look for an infringement.

there is a section in the cc&rs that says ""the association is entitled to access the homeowner's property with reasonable notice"" and also a section that says ""the homeowner may voluntarily submit the property keys to the association, however once submitted the association is not required to return the keys. submission of a key which does not work may incur a fine determined by the board"" which according to them, the keys to my property has been submitted (i'm assuming the previous owner have done so).

i have spoken with two board members who said they suspected that the keys that they hold for my property may have been fake and they've authorized their officers to check this out. they say according to them, in this case as they were searching for an infringement, reasonable notice means no notice to ensure that i won't have time to replace the locks.

and now i've received a $1000 fine because the keys submitted for my property to the hoa are fake. i have talked to a board member who tells me that their interpretation of the contract is that once a real key is submitted, the key must be kept up to date at all times or a fine is warranted. 

they also told me to not fight this as according to the bylaws the hoa is entitled to recover their legal fees from me in case i bring them to court or they bring me to court. so i'll lose either way because legal fees will end up costing me more than the fine itself. 

not sure if it's relevant, but the office of the hoa looks a lot like a leisure room. they have a pool table, a bar with a fancy fringe and a ton one drinks, a large tv and couches and stuff like that. and this isn't an amenity that is available for the people in the neighborhood, this is the ""relaxation room"" for the hoa officers and board members who are all old retired people. i definitely felt like this fine is for me to fund whatever they have going on there. 

help? i also want to add that this is a house. not a condo or apartment. ",2

"i laid off from my 99k job, my 8-month pregnant wife is still working making 90k (get 16wks paid leave), our emergency fund mostly drained from a prior emergency, and the day before i was laid off i signed up for a pmp course that will only give me a 75% refund; what next?. the debt we have is a few hundred on an amex bcp, about $6k on a 0% card with 20 months left, plus two car payments totaling about $700/mo. our mortgage is $1600/mo. i have an $804 child support payment. the pmp course was supposed to be reimbursed by my company and was $2,500 at a local university - the best i can get is $2000 back. it was charged to the 0% card. i'm a consultant/software developer, my wife is a construction manager. in addition to any other advice reddit has, and an aggressive job search, my question is: should i stay in the pmp course, or accept the $500 loss and cancel it?

*i -was- laid off. caffeine hasn't kicked in yet.

update: we were only making that much money for 19 months and 4 months in we were hit with a 35k lawsuit. prior to that, combined we made less than half of that. i was paying $600/mo in good faith, but when we moved the ex wanted more and sued. we mediated for $804/mo eventually, but not before she dragged everything out. i paid $4k in arrears. we also sunk a lot of money into house repairs.

update 2: i absolutely sincerely appreciate the advice and the sympathy. i also understand the rage: ""how you you be making this much money and be so <insert colorful words here>."" i really worked hard to get here, made a few mistakes and foolish choices, and had some bad luck. that's life - and i'm confident that i'll recover.

"how did a population of landlocked seals manage to establish itself in lake baikal, of all places, at an altitude of 450 m and several hundred kilometers from the nearest coastline???. i'm familiar with other landlocked seal populations, such as those in lac des loups marins in northern quebec, but those are right next to the coast and roughly at sea-level too .... easily explained by isostatic rebound. 

but baikal???

the baikal critters are perched way up at almost half a km altitude and almost 1500 km from the closest coast (the okhotsk sea).

i don't get it...

and if it happened in baikal, why not in other large freshwater lakes such as lake superior, great bear lake ~~or even lake ladoga~~?

edit: thanks to /u/gsdthrowaway1 for bringing the lake ladoga seals to my attention. but these are still landlocked seals in a place that makes sense : a low-lying lake in a flat area prone to isostatic rebound within spitting distance of the sea.",9

"just because a guy isn't comfortable with his girlfriend/wife being revealing doesn't make them controlling.. some people actually just don't want the world to see what they have. maybe it's having a ""type"" but i like having a girl who isn't comfortable showing so much because that's where feeling special comes to mind. it makes me feel special. i don't judge the girls who do reveal themselves more than others i just don't prefer it for my significant other and that's something that you should know before you get into the relationship. call it insecurity or controlling but i won't force a girl to cover herself but it's not something i would like to turn the other way to. and before the comments say anything about it being ""vice versa"" i am very secure of myself when it comes to revealing. if they're fine with it or not i will not show myself around for anyone to see what is sacred for my woman. sorry if this offends anyone just had to get that off of my chest for the simple fact that everyone is literally going around and shouting ""controlling"" ""insecurity"" all because their boyfriend didn't want them to wear only thongs and lingerie bras to a rave.




edit: so someone commented but deleted their comment before i could reply so i'll repeat what was said. it was something along the lines of ""it is insecurity and not so much preference, maybe you should re-evaluate your way.. and no one is ""yours to begin with"" or something like that sorry i can't remember well but i know it offended me because of the word ""re evaluate"" and this was my response:

""do you know a relationship is a duo thing. a partner thing where it's not just about you anymore it's about the both of you. i don't get into relationships for fun. my goal is to marry and if that isn't yours then that's fine i guess do whatever you want. but it's not longer inviting me to a party it's inviting us. we come as a group. have you ever heard someone call another person their other half? are you going to call them wrong and say that ""well they're not yours"" it's a figure of speech. where does a relationship draw the line? because they're not ""yours"" literally, means they can go out and cheat? and it be okay because they're not yours? no. there's certain things you expect in a relationship and sorry if you disagree or feel offended but it's not something i need to work on. if i feel like i don't want my significant other to be revealing that's my choice, just as it is vice versa if they don't want a significant other who cares about what they wear. it has everything to do with preference. it's not controlling it's not insecurity it's preference. if i choose not to be with a girl because i don't want to deal with that topic then that's okay and i'm not obligated to change my ways because someone wants me to adapt to their life if they can't adapt to mine.""",6

my girlfriend and i have been together for almost a year and living together for about two months. honestly, i love her dearly and love the time we spend together, but the amount of times she has to inconvenience us by going to the bathroom has gotten extremely annoying. i feel bad for being annoyed by this, but hear me out. 

we can't go on drive any longer than 2 hours without her needing to stop. when we're out shopping, at least once we always have to stop what we're doing to find a bathroom, which can sometimes take up a lot of time. at dinner, i always have to wait after we pay so she can go. at night, she'll get up while i'm sleeping etc etc. i know she can't help it, and she's only 20 and is perfectly healthy, but it's seriously gotten on my nerves a ton.

"if i go to hr over jesus propaganda at work?. edit: thanks y'all! i'm not going to talk to any higher-ups unless something like this happens again. i've read many helpful comments and many ridiculous ones, the only thing i feel i need to clarify is that i keep my joking about religious iconography confined to ranty posts on the internet. in fact i just avoid talking about religion in general unless it's with my husband, since most of my nearest and dearest are christians as well. some of you also got the reference, so thanks for not immediately accusing me of being one of ""those atheists""! 

so last night at work, it was pretty clear that my manager was stressed out/in a bad mood. during our startup meeting, she was discussing how much work we had to do, improvements we needed to make, and the fact that no one was meeting production goals. next week is the beginning of peak season, so essentially she was telling us to get our shit together. after her speech, an older lady who was working overtime and from another shift, said, ""after all that we need some good news! i've got some good news for y'all!"" 

when my manager asked her what the good news was, she said, ""jesus is coming back!"" now, i found this pretty annoying, but it has less to do with the fact that i'm an atheist and more to do with us being at *work*. i'm used to people inappropriately inserting jesus into random conversations or assuming everyone around them is a christian (born and raised in georgia), so i rolled my eyes but knew there was no point in voicing my opinion. plus, my manager responded with, ""amen,"" along with one of my coworkers. safe to say there were more people on the older lady's side than mine. 

this is where it gets worse and where i actually got offended, or rather uncomfortable. after the meeting, when we were all getting our equipment out and getting to our various stations, the older lady came up to me. only me, from what i saw. she stuck out her hand to give me some jesus propaganda, and when i tried to refuse (nicely, all i said was no thank you in a pleasant tone), she insisted and said that i needed it. i'm assuming she saw me roll my eyes at her comment during startup. 

i really did not appreciate this at all, and her singling me out like that changed my mind on the whole ""no point in voicing my opinion"" thing. my husband, who works at the same place in another department, was also pretty pissed about it. 

i don't think there's much point in asking my manager to talk to this lady, because she is very much a christian judging by her southern curly-scripted bible verse t shirts and her lowercase t necklace. my husband says i should bring this up to hr so that someone can tell this lady how not okay it is to confront someone with religion in the workplace. 

so, if i do? there's a big chance that hr and everyone i work with will think i'm an asshole.",3

"my male friend got raped and i did nothing to stop it. remorse. remorse

first time here, hopefully i tagged correctly.


it was christmas. my first christmas with nothing but friends getting hammered at my best friends house. we all got each other alcohol for presents naturally, so, lots of harmless debauchery took place.

male and female alike just going crazy drinking, kissing, and sometimes flashing body parts just because. i don't think i've ever drank that much since. but i'm not here to only tell you the fun parts. as the title suggests, shit took a dark turn. 

i won't use real names, just the first initial of their name. s is the girl, r the guy. so, r was always popular. r is an above average looking guy, and no joke, everyone loved him. i mean, the friends of my best friend worshipped this dude. we went to different schools so, i didn't. i think that was why r liked me so much. i treated him like everyone else, when everyone else male or female was just itching to get his approval. 

s was not very popular or attractive. she was always sad, a bummer. once in the military with a decent body to make up for her fuck ugly face, that had gone by the time this party was taking place.

the whole night i remember bits and pieces of s throwing herself at r. r had just broken up with a girl he loved, and didn't want to fuck anything, that was clear. just drink and socialize. i didn't realize at the time how aggressive s actually was that night. it's only now years later i can't stop thinking about it.

we all started to pass out in various locations around my best friends house. r on the big couch, another friend on the other. i slept on the floor because apparently i was the first to fall asleep, and i did so right by the front door (don't remember this part). from this spot i could lift up my head and see r sleeping, and people on blankets sleeping all around me on the floor too.

s was on top of r, when i woke up. at first i thought oh damn, my buddy is getting some good for him. then i realized who it was and knew r had never been interested in s like that so i pretended to be asleep and listened, still pretty hammered at this point but..the noises were...off.

it wasn't hushed whispers, kisses and giggles but more...her making hush sounds and r groaning. i swear he said something like ""what..stop...sleeping..no"".

it's like..i was so drunk i assumed what i was hearing wasn't really happening. i rationalized it like that. i could've gotten up, said something, but i was..not scared but just..mortified. i passed back out, or possibly willed myself asleep to escape what i was hearing. 

the next morning no one said anything or mentioned what i had heard. i shrugged it off as a nightmare, at first. r seemed happy enough, just hung over and like usual a (best friend), r, and i were smoking outside piecing the night back together, reminiscing. by this point, all the others had left so it was just a, r, and i.

""so you got a little action last night huh, r? how was it?"" he looked at me like i had just spoken to him in a dead language. ""uh what? i don't remember much of last night but i know for sure i just passed out on the couch."" at this point a spoke up, apparently without me knowing, he had been awoken by the rape sounds too. ""dude i saw you fucking s on the couch last night, it's cool you don't have to lie, idc lol""

r was visibly upset by this point, thinking we were fucking with him. it took some more of us piecing the night together but eventually he recalled bits of it. i'll never forget the look on his face when he realized we weren't fucking with him. even more chilling and forever stuck in my mind was what he said next, ""why didn't you try and help me?""

i lied and said well, it looked like you were having a good time, i was drunk, i didn't know...so many excuses. i'm a bad friend. i know that. i'm sorry r. if somehow you read this dude, i'm sorry.

p.s. it probably isn't surprising but s has since turned into a sjw 3rd wave feminist. when i see her posts on fb about the evil patriarchy or her outrage over a male raping a female, i get sick. she raped him, and what's even more disturbing is she denies it ever happening. 

fuck you, s.",11
"i'm (34m) really into this girl (27f) who is the complete opposite of me. i'm afraid dating her will ruin my reputation. what should i do?. a friend of mine decided to get a tattoo, and asked me to go with him. he made an appointment with a popular local tattoo artist. i really ended up hitting it off with her. i went through a bad break up last year, and haven't had much luck dating since, so i decided what the hell, i'll try a little strange, and asked her out for a drink.  it went great.  really great. we've been seeing each other for about two months now. 

here's my problem, i'm pretty straight laced. i come from a conservative family, i have a conservative job, my bosses are country club types, i wear a suit to work and play golf on the weekends. she on the other hand is heavily tattooed, which i always found trashy before but for some reason i find it incredibly sexy on her. she's slightly punk, and is all around the opposite of me. 

if i decide to get serious with her, my family is going to freak out, i can't see them ever approving of her.  she will hurt my reputation at work and not be good for my career. it sucks but is just straight up true. my friends think it's weird that i'm dating her and think i'm going through something because of my break up. and this is going to make me sound like an asshole but i am a little worried about what my ex is going to think. i feel like she'll think i'm trying to get back at her for dumping me.  

here's the thing though, i'm crazy about this girl. she's gorgeous, successful, driven (wants to open her own shop), off the charts confident, talented, smart, sexy and just all around cool. sex with her is without a doubt the best i've ever had. she's uninhibited and does things to me that i didn't know i wanted. it's dirty and primal. i've had to start jerking off before i see her because i don't last more than two minutes otherwise. she laughs at my shitty jokes. we have a lot in common, like we both love action movies and whiskey. she's introduced me to things i never would have even given a chance before.  honestly if it weren't for the judgement, i would marry her tomorrow. 

i've worked really hard for my career and i'm not sure i want to potentially jeopardize it.  but on the other hand i've never felt this way about anyone. she's everything i didn't know i wanted. i'm torn. really really torn. 

should i say fuck it and go for it with her?

edit:  i want to thank everyone for their comments, especially the harsh ones. it's really made me take a hard look at myself and i realize that this is 100% about my hang ups. i have been a lot more judgmental than i ever stopped to consider.  i'm going to work on changing that about myself. 

i'm going to go for it, i think i'll regret it for the rest of my life if i don't. i'm going to tell her how i feel about her tomorrow. this may have been premature (depending on how tomorrow goes) but i called my sister and told her about my  (hopefully) new girlfriend.  she was supportive, but she did share the same concerns about our parents. but fuck it, and soon as she's open to it, i'm going to have her meet them. 

hopefully i'll have a good update tomorrow!  
thanks again.",7
"walking around smelling like weed is just as bad as body odor. whenever someone is walking around smelling strongly of weed, i think it's just about as bad as someone who hasn't showered in a few days and hasn't used deodorant. it's just the same as durians being banned in singapore's metro system for smelling terrible. if you smoke a joint, take a shower and change clothes, because others shouldn't have to deal with it.

"(ma) hospital placed a wire in my arm to track me, without my knowledge or consent. photo included for proof. i have called multiple law offices but no one is returning my calls. somebody please, please help me.. about three weeks ago, i was admitted to a psychiatric hospital due to various problems. it's a long story, but the short version is i have schizoaffective personality disorder and i was not taking my meds properly. after i was stabilized, i was discharged, but it has come to my attention that something is terribly wrong.

the hospital has placed a wire in my arm that i believe acts as a tracking device. it is quite obvious, especially when i flex my arm-- i can see it bulge in my wrist. i tried to take a picture but imgur is not letting me upload.

this has caused me great distress. i stay locked in my house because i'm afraid of going somewhere or doing something ""wrong"" and getting forced back to the hospital. i've also become concerned about my medications. if the hospital staff inserted a wire without my consent, what have they done with my meds? i have zyprexa and haldol, but i dare not take them now.

i have a few questions about the legal aspect of all this:

1. the insertion of the tracking device without my consent-- surely that's not legal? my understanding is the patient has to consent before a medical procedure is done.

2. the distress caused by this, does that count as damages? should i sue?

3. how on earth do i get the wire removed? i don't have money to pay a surgeon to remove it. can i get the psych hospital to pay for it?

i've called several law offices in my area and explained my case, but no one has called me back. i feel so isolated and i'm getting desperate. please, somebody help me.

**edit: thanks to everyone who has talked to me. i guess legal advice is not really what i needed. i am calling an ambulance and getting help.**",2

"for asking my boyfriend to kiss me after a blowjob?. today i gave a bj to my bf, normally i don't finish him and we continue with normal sex. however today we wanted to try finishing the job.
it wasn't bad or anything, however afterwards he refused to kiss me. we kind of had a discussion about it. i said i would always kiss him after he has gone down on me, but he said that is a totally different situation. after a bit of nagging on my part he finally kissed me although he didn't seem to be thrilled about it.

so reddit, aita?

update:

as there are quite a few more comments than i had expected i thought it would be nice to give you guys some extra info and an update.


first i wanted to say that me (21f) and my boyfriend (22m) have been together for over a year now. he is the best bf in the world and i love him very much. both of us have not had any previous relationships, so we still encounter new things regularly and we are still learning.


secondly, i understand that not everybody likes cum. that's why i had already flushed my mouth with water before i came back for a kiss. especially since i know my boyfriend can be quite squeamish sometimes. after this i just felt kind of rejected because the idea of kissing me disgusted him so much.
i asked him after reading the comments if he felt like i pressured him into something he didn't want to do and i apologized. pressuring him was definitely not my intention, i would never want to do that to him. he said he didn't feel that way and that he was sorry too for making me feel rejected.


whatever your verdict may be, thank you all for your comments!",3

"for making my mil pay for food i ordered after she ruined the one we had?. my wife and i were hosting a barbecue on sunday. half an hour before the guests arrived we were busy preparing food and my mil was helping us.

while i was busy doing something else i asked my mil to take the pasta salad i had prepared out of the fridge and taste for seasoning. she said that it needed more salt and i told her to add it, but not use the big salt shaker we have, because too much comes out of it. she used it anyways and oversalted the dish. i was really angry and tried to fix it with more mayo but it just didn't taste good. i told my mil that i would have to order a new pasta salad from a local place, which she said wasn't necessary but i did anyways. about 15 minutes after the guests arrived i see the delivery guy at our front door. i tell my mil to get up and she asks why. i tell her that the delivery guy is here so she can pay him. she looks at me stunned and asks ""why should i pay him"". so i have to expain that because she ruined the pasta salad she has to pay for the new one. she finally gets up to pay him but it's incredibly awkward and my wife is giving me the death stare. the guests seem kinda awkward too and my mil didn't talk to me at all for the rest of the party.

after the guests were gone my wife flipped her shit at me. she called me an imbecile and an asshole and said that i embarassed myself and damaged the realationship to her mother. it's been three days and she's still angry about this. aita?

"i lied to everyone: my ""accidental"" craigslist baby. this is long, but it's everything i needed to say.   i had a baby with donated sperm from a man i met via craigslist. 

i am a woman in my middle 40's.  i'm smart, friendly, kind, helpful, active, and interested in the arts and sciences.  i have a decent job and live in a mid size metropolitan area. 

i am not being coy when i say i'm ugly.  like, really ugly.  for real.   it's plain and simple that i did not make out when it came to genetics.  i have never had a boyfriend and i've never been loved because the one thing you are not allowed to be if you are a woman is ugly.   

hell, i'm so ugly, i don't even have that many friends.  the only sex i've had has been with men who were too drunk to care. the ones who, after their beer goggles wear off in the morning, probably feel dirty and ashamed they hit something as ugly as me and swear not to get that drunk ever again.  all this while they make as quick an escape as possible.   as if ugly is catching.   i have often wished i were gay because gay women don't seem to judge each other as harshly as men do. 

that's the honest truth.   i'm okay with knowing i'll never have a boyfriend or husband, in knowing that i'll never know the love of a partner.  it hurts, sure it does, but i've also come to accept my lot in life as far as that's concerned.  also, now that i am ugly and in my mid-40's, i have suddenly become invisible and that feels better somehow.  side note: please remember that ugly people can be pretty nice, cool, interesting, funny, kind wonderful people! those traits do not disappear just because someone is ugly. 

for a long time i naturally assumed that meant i wouldn't ever have children either.  no husband = no children.  that part hurt a lot.  i knew i'd make a really great mom if someone would give ugly a chance. no one ever did.   but duh! then it occurred to me that one day i could try to have a kid if i damn well wanted, husband or no.  this is *my* life and i only get one shot at it. i should do what makes me happy, do what i want in my life so i don't have major regret later.  i don't have any addictions or mental health issues & i'm a good person.  so i decided to have one! 

i had a few problems, though. 

1. judgement from friends and parental wrath (they are religious) 
2.  i'm older for someone trying to get pregnant so it would cost more money than i have for ifv/donor sperm or adoption.  all that stuff is expensive.  

my parents probably would have disowned me, i never would have heard the end of it - to try to have a baby out of wedlock??  the horror!! the *sin*!  my parents don't let shit go - harp harp harp.  my father has a nasty, mean streak too.   i didn't need the stress, so i kept it 100% to myself, even my best friend doesn't know.  she would judge me and try to talk me out of it.  she's not a kid person, she's very against children and speaking on zero population growth, etc etc.. downright hates kids.   and so *her* feelings about children would be projected onto me. this is the first time i'm telling anyone the real truth. 

i also certainly could not afford ifv, fertility treatments or to pay for donor sperm, etc.  adoption is also crazy fucking expensive!  

so i did the research and came up with my own, semi dangerous plan. 

i am in my mid 40's so my chance of conceiving is lower but i've had a regular period forever so i hoped my chances were still reasonably good.   step 1. so i read up on fertility treatments & purchased clomid from an overseas/online pharmacy clomid is a drug that is used to help women ovulate.   step 2: donor semen.  did you know that there are men on craigslist willing to donate their sperm to help women  conceive?   i think it's mostly a fetish for them, but who cares! i trolled craigslist for a few months, interviewing about 8 different men. i weeded out the guy who only wanted to do it naturally and wouldn't do a donation in a cup --  as to me that was suspicious.  if you are willing to donate why does it have to be penis in a vagina?  so yeah, i weeded out the those men, men who wouldn't agree to be std tested, men who just seemed weird. 

after much search i found a very reasonable man.  i told him the truth, that i was ugly and therefore couldn't find a mate but wanted children.  he was fine with that.   he is married with 5 children, has an advanced degree, a professional position and was willing to do a donation in a cup. that he was wanting to donate in a cup, that right there told me wasn't a craigslist creeper.  

his wife know and approves of what he is doing.  we met for coffee a few times to get to know one another.  he was decent looking, cordial, friendly and was wanting to donate to help women and couples who couldn't otherwise conceive.   he had already donated to 2 lesbian couples and 1 hetero couple who needed it and all three of them were successful & had children.  he also donated to one other single woman who was older like me, but she couldn't get pregnant after 1.5 years of trying.   all of his connections were via craigslist and all because doing it through proper channels is very, very expensive.  he did all of his donations via cup, not the natural way & had been std checked recently.. plus had a lab report to prove it.  totally on the up and up and an all around nice person. 

we didn't sign any papers it was a ""i'll trust you if you trust me"" kind of deal. 

i tried for about 10 months, tracking my ovulation with a thermometer, etc.  i would tell him i was ovulating and we drive to meet that day. he would jerk off into cervical cap and i would place it inside me.   sometimes we had to meet in a parking lot some where because that's how our schedules overlapped, and i kid you not, this will sound creepy but he had a van, which made it much easier to do the jerk off then insert cup thing.    month after month of disappointment.  i was beginning to think i was just too old. 

i then decided to go ahead and invest in a clearblue easy fertility monitor.  it was $200 with the sticks but turns out the best thing i bought!  basically you pee on these sticks each morning, the monitor the reads how much of whatever hormones it checks for and tell you how fertile you are.  turned out to be a great investment and one i wished i'd sprung for earlier in the process.   i got pregnant on the 2nd month of using it!   

i told everyone that it was an accident.  my parents were supportive of me keeping it because to them abortion is bad blah blah religion... and so far my friends have been supportive too.   

i had an easy pregnancy and easy labor and delivery and now i have a healthy baby who is under 1 year.  i don't want to say exact age or gender.  it was the best thing i ever did - i've never been happier.  it's going to be a struggle, but i feel fulfilled as a human being and as woman.   i'm every day extremely grateful to the man who donated his sperm to an ugly girl to make a beautiful baby. 

i may be ugly, but it turns out i'm an excellent mother. 

edit: for everyone telling me i'm not as ugly as i think i am and all that - i was born with facial deformities that can't be fixed.  so yeah, ugly for real.

"my girlfriend's sister kissed me.. my girlfriend's younger sister is in university and as part of her biology major she has to take a differential calculus course. i majored in math when i was in college and my girlfriend volunteered me to help her. she was really struggling with it and she had already failed it once last year. it has been a little inconvenient but i don't really mind.

last night i was just sitting with her at the kitchen table as i usually would. we discussing something to do with pde and then out of nowhere she just kissed me on the lips. i didn't respond at all and after a few seconds she pulled back, looked at me and then just ran up to her bedroom. i waited half an hour but she didn't come back down so i assumed that she didn't want to talk about it and just left.

the whole thing was so odd. there was no sexual tension at all so i'm not really sure why she would kiss me. also, i'm in a relationship with her sister... i haven't told my gf yet and i'm not sure if i should. i also haven't heard from her sister so... i don't really know what to do.

"it's been 20 years since my brother took his life due to the abuse we suffered when we were kids. i'm still waiting for my turn.. i'm 37 now, my brother was 15 when he decided to hang himself. our childhood was pretty fucked up. back when we were younger there wasn't a lot of attention to abused kids. especially if the abuser was related to you. our parents married young and their marriage was doomed from the very start. my mother saw that and decided to have kids as if that would make it better. it did until it didn't. 

since our father worked she would take care of us but in reality she would often leave us unattended and hungry at home while she would take walks. our father couldn't speak on it because she would threaten to hurt us. i was 5 when she started to beat me up pretty bad. i would often have bruises and she would always make sure that my brother could see her beating me. she got a lot smarter too. buying us tons of clothes and toys so people would praise how much she thought about her children. she would switch doctors often too so they wouldn't pick up anything weird. she got a lot of praise for that too because she would say that she wanted to hear as many professionals as she could to make sure we would get the best treatment. 

meanwhile, we would be getting beaten and starved. she would sometimes lock us up inside of cabinets and leave us there. she would also makes us sleep on the ground. to be honest there isn't much i remember from that time besides the stuff she would do to us. she would often threaten our father so he would buy her stuff and keep his mouth shut. she would say that one day she would set the house on fire while he worked and she was the only one who would survive. she would often tease us with lit matches.

she would also make up excuses saying that our immune system was very weak and that we would be homeschooled. which pretty much hindered our interactions with the outside world. she would also use the different doctors to back up her claims. at this point we had a lot of development issues. my brother didn't talk at all and i would only talk broken sentences.

it was only when my brother was 5 that we escaped this hell. or so we thought. my mother took us for a walk which was a surprise for two kids who never left home. she made a stop on a store a few blocks away from our house and there she asked the cashier to look after me so she could take my brother to the bathroom at our house nearby. she never came back to pick me up and it was only later that the police arrived. 
my brother was only found at night. she had left him in a bus and the only reason he came back was because the driver knew our father. my brother was a wreck. he was so swollen from crying. our father told the police that she was on meds and the police didn't really care much and just allowed us to go home.

she never came back home. after a week our father took us to live on another city. we didn't get better. we never learned what my brother went through with her. he never really learned how to speak properly. he would talk very slowly and very quietly. almost like he was whispering. he wouldn't leave the house either and forcing him to do so would cause him to have severe mental breakdowns. mental care wasn't good at all so he never had access to a proper healthcare. 

the thing that haunted us the most was the fact that our mother had vanished. so we would always be waiting for her to open the door and start beating us up again. it was common for us to have panic attacks and nightmares. we would spend days in bed with fever and hallucinating. it was hell.

entering the teen years was even more horrifying. our mental health got even worse and i guess this is what took my brother away from me. one night before dinner we found him hanging by the neck in his room. this somehow was the thing that broke me. because i was the one supposed to suffer first. i was the one who was supposed to be hurt first so hopefully he would be spared.

"so i'm a college-educated 28 year old male, and i found out that women don't pee out of their butt yesterday.. throwaway because, goddammit. so yesterday, i was walking home with my g/f and we were talking about how penises are really handy if you want to quickly public urinate. 

and then i said, ""well you don't have it that bad, you can just pee out of your butt.""

""what do you mean?""

""you can just pee out of your butt?""

""you think that women pee out of our butts?""

""err...yes, right? don't you?""

my g/f, quickly gaining traction as a ""keeper"" fell down on the sidewalk laughing hysterically and told me to google it, and the image on wikipedia was a cartoon of a woman spread eagle with a nice drinking-water-all-day pee spray coming right out of her lady parts, which up until that moment i assumed was a one-way-street.

i was speechless. how had this basic fact of human anatomy escaped me for so long? on paper, i'm not that much of an idiot. i have a masters degree. i read books voraciously. i have slept with enough women to know what everything is supposed to do down there. at least i thought i did.

i'm the kind of guy that will interrupt you if you say something like, ""isn't it amazing that we know more about space than our own oceans?"" 

and then i'll explain exactly why that's incorrect, citing the expanding size of the universe, solar system parallels such as europa's oceans where we don't even know if life exists, let alone the extent and diversity of its life -- and that's just one moon in the whole known universe, and then look down on you for bringing it up in the first place. i had a relationship that ended right after that conversation. true story. 

so ashamedly with a forensic eye, i've spent most of my night looking at weird girl-on-girl pee porn as objectively and medically as possible. (because what the fuck do you think comes up when you look up ""women peeing""?) and the evidence confirms it. pee does not come out of a woman's butt. it's like a little valve, hidden in plain sight all this time right next to the vagina. i honestly never knew that little guy was there. even more evidence that a woman's lady-parts sure go through a lot.   

i'm not sure who failed me...was it the public schools? my parents? the government? media? society? the church?

somewhere along my life not having sisters, and no interest in pee and sex, i was lead to believe that because women pee sitting down -- that urine must, in fact, come from the anus. in my very tragic defense, i've never watched a girl pee before. i'm always as far away from the bathroom as possible if a ladyfriend has to evacuate herself. 

of course now the more i think about it, the more logical this seems in terms of human development. after all, a vagina is just an inside out penis (or a penis is an inside out vagina, depending on how you want to look at it). but i haven't been able to sleep for the past few days, just thinking about this.

"if i didn't let my niece with autism use my weighted blanket anymore?. 
a couple weeks ago though i saved up for a weighted blanket because i thought it would be a lot easier to deal with and it totally was. now i just use that blanket along with my regular comforter and sheet set. now while i absolutely love it, i don't need it to sleep.

last week i (17) got roped into watching my niece (5) over night because my sister had to work and our mom had plans. my niece has autism which causes her to have tantrums every now and then which is why i don't often watch her, but sometimes i have to because my sister (23) can't always afford or find a sitter, which is why she still lives with our mom. in case its not clear we're actually half sisters and half the time i them the other half i live with my dad and step mom.

so my niece had a really hard time going to sleep. like it was almost midnight and she was all over the place. which is not uncommon, but i was really tired myself and just wanted to go to sleep. so i thought why not try and use the blanket on her because thats kind of what they're made for. well it worked pretty well and calmed her down and she soon fell asleep. i was a little annoyed though that i didn't have my blanket to use anymore. 

the next morning my sister found her with the blanket and we got to talking about them. i told her how well it worked. she didn't really believe me so i let her use another night. my sister was very pleased by the results. so, over throughout the week when my niece had two really bad tantrums my sister asked if she could use the blanket. i said yes because she just looked so exhausted herself.

when she looked into buying one she became reluctant because my niece only likes very specific things my sister doesn't want to get her another one that she may not like since i don't remember which brand i got. she is short on cash so she doesn't want to have to buy multiples because honestly they can get rather expensive. i know mine was over $100 because i wanted to make sure i didn't have to deal with the beads spilling out issues that a lot of the cheaper ones have. i

well, when i went back to my dads the other night i brought my blanket with me. my sister calls me late one night completely frazzled and asks where i left my blanket because niece just wont calm down. when i told her i had it with me at my dads she was upset. not at me, just at the situation she had to deal with.

now i'm supposed to go back to my moms today and i don't really want to bring blanket back over there or at least sneaking it over there and saying i left it at my dad. i'm tired of not getting to use it whenever i want and also i just don't want to share it because something about a sharing blanket all the time feels gross to me.

update: several people have informed me that it is very dangerous for a child to use an adult size weighted blanket, so i guess the whole thing doesn't matter now. i'll just help my sister find a kid sized one.

also sorry about calling the meltdowns she was having tantrums. still learning about correct terminology.

thanks for all the suggestions for places to get blankets guys, but i think everyone already named everyplace that exists. the amount of comments is getting a little insane for me so i'm gonna sign off now. thanks again.",3
"girlfriend received a dui in a car that only had 3 wheels.. this is in west virginia. throwaway because she knows my regular account and wouldn't want anyone else to know about this.

my girlfriend and i went out for dinner then bar trivia and drinking. i only had a few drinks the whole evening but she had 5-6 mixed drinks and was very drunk. when it was last call i decided to drive her to her house in her car then uber back to my car and go home myself since i had work the next day.

i put her in the passenger seat of her car and started driving to her house but on the way i hit an awful pothole and busted a tire. i pulled over in a parking lot and started to change the tire but left the keys in the ignition so she would be warm since it was pretty chilly out. 

i jacked the car up and was proceeding to change the tire when a police car pulled into the parking lot and i thought he was going to help me out but instead he asked me if i was drunk. i told him i wasn't and explained i was taking my girlfriend home since she had been drinking. i took a voluntary field test and breathalyzer and blew under the limit. 

he then looked into the car and saw my girlfriend half asleep in the passenger seat and asked her if she was drunk and she said she was just sleepy. he then made her get out of the car and do a field sobriety test, which she failed, and then the breathalyzer where she blew a .10 (legal limit in state is .08). he then placed her under arrest because the keys were in the ignition and she was the only person in the car and intoxicated. please note that at this time i had not finished changing the tire so there were only 3 wheels on the car at the time.

he took her to the city station and after i fixed the tire i went down and bailed her out. my question now is if it was actually a dui. it seems very silly to me that she was charged since she was buckled up in the passenger seat and there was only 3 wheels on car at that time. we don't want to go through the first time offenders program if possible since it requires a plea and she is afraid it could affect her graduate work at the university. 

thank you.

"were cyclones more powerful when the earth was covered in superoceans?. are there simulations? did they leave any geological record as the supermonsoon did?
are there limiting factors after a certain ocean size/cyclone size or did more warm ocean equal more energy to the storms?
how long did they last?
can we compare them to known cyclones on other planets?

edits: 
1) i categorized this twice but i don't see it working, is this planetary science more than earth science??
2) i'd really like some links to theoretical simulations, even just on paper, if anyone has any references, so that i could play with them and do actual computer simulations.
3) thanks to everyone, i'll need some time to reply but answers are really interesting so far!",9
"by stealing coffee from starbucks. long story short, i got a mocha from starbucks this morning. i went through the drive thru and gave the girl my international debit card. this card works on 99% of places, but depending on the machine sometimes it just does not get recognized. she said the system was not recognizing my card and i was like oh well whatever... i guess no coffee for me this morning. 5 minutes after i left i realized when i gave her my card she gave me my coffee. now i understand why she was starring at me with big eyes when i said ""oh well.... whatever then"".

 i freaked out once i realized i stole the mocha. i drove back to the store to pay for my coffee with cash and explained the event to the barista. the barista laughed and said it was all good and they zeroed the amount when i left. i insisted but he kept saying it was all good. 

now i'm sitting at my university parking lot thinking maybe the drive thru girl does not hear i came back to pay for the coffee and i get in trouble for this. maybe i'm just anxious lol. 

tl;dr: did not pay for my coffee and left. realized i stole the coffee and tried to pay for it but the barista laughed at me. 

edit 1: grammar. 

edit 2: lots of people saying i am stupid for coming back and actually caring about the situation :(. i didn't realize it's rare to be sort of a decent person. i'm glad i went back because the barista does not deserve to deal with a customer that just takes the coffee and says ""oh well"" before driving off.

&#x200b;

i'm losing my mind. i posted friday about what happened previously. i will include the original content for people to read below. i need perspective and people's opinion on where to go from here. the whole wedding is fractured.

&#x200b;

after i posted my thread, i got a lot of great advice and suggestions. at around 5-something, i was hungry and went out to grab some dinner and come home. i got home and my future fil was in the parking lot. he saw me and asked to talk. he brought a cigar and beer so we chatted. he had no idea what happened and wanted to hear it from me. i told him the whole thing but refused to show him pictures. by this point i had a lot of the photos and they were pretty rough. my fil drank a beer, left me the rest and i ate dinner and smoked. he said he'd call later, so i turned my phone on. i had dozens and dozens of calls, maybe 100+ texts and whatsapp messages, fb messages and emails. i sifted through them through dinner and finally got an email from my future fil. short and to the point. his daughter is sorry, she's a horrible mess and is going to stay with him. he's disappointed in her, her friends and this situation, to take time but to please consider forgiving her. 

&#x200b;

right around 10 two of the bride's maids show up. they're knocking at the door and they want to talk. i let them in and we chat. they immediately start pointing the finger at the maid of honor, that she was the person that planned this and that they thought they were going to just have a ""girls night out."" the toplessness was a joke on the ""girls out"" and they didn't know that a stripper was coming. they had apparently had something to eat, drank a ton, went to one of the other bride's maids house and were getting changed to go to a club and were all wasted. they confirmed that my fiancee was by far the drunkest and both confirmed that the stripper did indeed touch her below the belt. fiancee was obliterated drunk and did verbally stop him after he touched her *there*. after that, people got uncomfortable (the stripper was totally naked.....) and they left. my fiancee sobered up somewhat after water and some time between drinks and then immediately began boozing again at the bar/club which is when they plunked her in a chair. 

&#x200b;

the bride's maids left at around 11 and i thanked them for telling me the truth. they felt that my fiancee had been too drunk to do much and that they were all surprised the stripper showed up. they all said it was the maid of honor who organized this and asked me to just talk with my fiancee. i wasn't in the mood but texted her not to engage my parents, i didn't want them involved with this and that she should keep them out of it and we'd talk. that opened the gates and she texted me on/off most of the night. i finally agreed to meet her the next morning. it was awkward, neither of us knew exactly what to say. she was crying and wanted a hug. 

&#x200b;

we sat down and she basically apologized for everything, took responsibility and said that she was sorry for what happened. she agreed that she was too drunk, should have excused herself or stopped drinking and didn't know a stripper would be coming. she said that everyone was topless and she explained that there was some dancing, the stripper did his show and then pushed her on the bed and inserted her finger. she said no, he quickly removed it and no one knew what to do. moh danced with him a bit more, then their time was up and he left. i asked about the photos and moh and another bride's maid took photos, the moh took the finger sniffing photo. i asked who else has photos of the event and she doesn't know but hopes moh doesn't ""use them"" for any sort of revenge. 

&#x200b;

i told her i understood but was hurt and horrified. she indicated that she talked to her father and then her moh who basically turned on fiancee and said she did her a favor, etc. they aren't talking and as a gesture, fiancee will remove her from the wedding and we'll just have an off-balance of people in the wedding party. she hadn't slept so after a while she went to go sleep and i went and ran errands. 

&#x200b;

we basically kept to ourselves on saturday. on sunday she made me breakfast and crawled into bed with me. i had to be clear that i'm still really upset and told her that i'm hurt, i'm disappointed, i'm not ""just over it."" she said she understood but wouldn't let this ""come between us."" 

&#x200b;

i'm starting to feel bad that i'm not somehow over it and i'm not sure if i should just drop this whole thing. in the past, my fiancee has been a solid person, she's not the kind to get drunk or would have ever done something like this. i have a business trip coming up shortly that she is slated to travel with me for. she's packing her bags and looking to go. i'm not sure what to do. to recap:

&#x200b;

1. she's completely and unreservedly apologized
2. she is removing the maid of honor from the wedding 
3. her friends and family think this indiscretion is a one-off and to work through it 
4. she should still come on the business trip i'm going to.

&#x200b;

i need perspective. i feel like a whirlwind has knocked me back and i'm not sure what to do.

the orginal post: 

&#x200b;

i've been with my fiancee for going on 4 years. we got engaged a little over a year ago and were going to put a rush on the wedding because her mother was sick. her mom had smoked for a long time, quit, picked it back up, and then developed cancer. to look at her mom, you'd never suspect she was a smoker, but had picked up the habit. her mother grew too ill for a wedding so the idea of putting one together quickly faded and instead a couple of months ago, she passed. my fiancee was devastated to lose her mom at such a young age. i offered to postpone the wedding but she really wanted to move forward with it and took to planning.

we agreed that we weren't too interested in bachelor/bachelorette parties and instead decided we'd do something low key. her maid of honor approached me about doing something more ""substantive"" for fiancee as she lost her mom not too long ago. i thought it was a good idea. i arranged for dinner/drinks and fun with my groomsmen. the best man (my brother) and my best friend booked a steakhouse and then arranged for drinks at a nice place afterwards. they bought me a nice cigar for the lounge and we had a tremendous time.

fiancee was texting me and then her phone died. she was out incredibly late – her friends said they packed it in around 5 am and then slept most of the morning and hate a late lunch rather than brunch. when she got home she was still hungover and basically laid in bed and drank gatorade instead of doing anything. the saturday and sunday were pretty much a write-off. she was that hungover. i asked her about it and she kept saying she pretty much has no recollection after a certain point. her friends said something similar, that she was so obliterated after like 3 am that they carried her to a friend's brother's bar where they hung out while my fiancee sipped booze while splayed in a chair.

things were fine until last night when she asked me to find something on her phone. i noticed a message come through saying my name, so yes, i snooped. it said ""i also hope \my real name\ doesn't find out."" i scroll up and it's a nightmare. this afternoon, my fiancee texts her maid of honor saying that she hasn't been that drunk ""in a long time"" and her friend follows up with ""i know"" and a series of photos – my wife and her friends in a room – most of the women are topless, including my fiancee, and there's a stripper. fiancee responds ""oh god. can we not."" and another photo follows with the *stripper kissing her neck* while her friends are topless, holding booze and obviously acting poorly. fiancee texts ""i feel bad because \my real name\ had such a tame night. he's such a good boy. i hope he doesn't find out."" that's when moh responds: ""i also hope \my real name\ doesn't find out"" and by this point has added ""he'd leave you."" during their night out, someone must have used her phone to take photos to commemorate her little dalliance, because there must have been another half dozen photos on her phone. the worst being what looks like my topless fiancee laying on the bed with her friends around her and a naked stripper smelling his finger. i was horrified.

i didn't know what to do and didn't want to come out and say i snooped so i tried to get her to talk about the evening. i told her about our evening. she deflected, said she was drunk, and that she never needs to be drunk again and then says something how she's not at all jealous of her single friends and can't wait to get married. we're getting married ***in four weeks***. i couldn't take it and told her i knew. she freaked out and at first got mad that i snooped but then realized the gravity of the situation. she began to apologize and hid behind being drunk. i didn't accept that and she started crying. i went to another room to cool off and i guess she texted her friend because i received a flurry of texts telling me that it was a mistake and nothing happened. after a few hours of arguing, fiancee tells me that they went to someone's house where they all got obliterated and a stripped arrived. they decided to take their tops off and have fun. the stripper did his thing and kissed my fiancee's neck and chest and attempted to touch her genitals but she stopped him. they tipped him and he left. i didn't handle it well and basically said that it didn't really matter at the end of the day and that the wedding was off. she looked stunned. i threw some clothes into a bag and told her to leave. to my surprise she left.  her maid of honor texted me that i'm an asshole and i replied asking how much of the money i contributed towards their night went to a stripper putting the moves on my fiancee? i haven't heard from her since.

i took the day off work and had to turn my phone off. my fiancee has texted evert 3 or 4 minutes. her father called/texted and then sent me a long email. i checked my phone again about 6 minutes ago and it's non-stop texts from a bunch of people. no one on my side of the family knows. my fiancee is saying she'll do anything, she wants to come home, she's sorry. her father texted me again to please call him and her friends added me to a whatsapp group that basically outlines the whole night, their indiscretion and is telling me that she's sorry/they're sorry that she was too drunk and that i'm an asshole for not talking to them.

i know i eventually have to say something. i don't know what to say or to whom. i don't even know how to handle this. not in a million years would i have ever thought my fiancee would do something like this. she's the most stable, earnest, nice and straightforward person ever. i don't understand it. i don't know what to do here.",7
"""i cant cook"" is a cop out. i have heard from so many different people that they make their so cook bc they ""can't"". i find this to be a cop out. if you're literate and have a functioning stove, oven, or any other appliance, you can cook, you just dont want to read and follow instructions on how to cook a decent meal.

edit 1 bc i incorrectly and hastily used the word learn. it really is laziness

edit 2 bc i'm learning after posting this that its really not all that unpopular 

edit 3 bc i've learned that posting on unpopular opinion is not the best to do if you really dont like notifications 😂

"for telling my friend that it's not abuse.. so my friend 25f told me yesterday that she was abused a child. i automatically went to tell her how sorry i was and that if she wanted to tell me about it i'm a listening ear. 

she starts to tell me about her abuse and i kinda thought that everything she was telling me was not abuse. 

so she talked about how her phone was taken off her at 8.00 every night. 
he mom would only buy her thrift store clothing. 
her mum had the naughty chair, it was the chair you sat in for 10 minutes if you where naughty. 
she did not get treats after dinner 

she then went on about how sometimes she was starved, so i asked how long that could last. she told me that she was not allowed to eat food an hour before dinner. and midnight snacks where banned. 

i asked if she bad ever been hit, i also added that she can refuse to answer a question if she does not want to answer. 
she had never been hit and her mum never called her any names or yelled at her, unless she was being naughty. 

i asked if there was anything else and she said no. 

that all seemed pretty normal to me. 

i then said, that's not abuse, all the mums i work with at the church group do the same things. 

she got megga pissed and left and is refusing to speek to me. 

i honestly think i was being an asshole and if she does not want to talk to me after this i'll accept. but hey i wanna see what others think.",3
"no regrets i didn't have sex with my tinder date because of her poor hygiene.. i met up with her and she looked nothing like her tinder profile. the plan was to go to my place and watch a movie. i felt bad so we did that anyway. while she was there we started talking about tinder. i jokingly pointed out that her photos look nothing like her. she let me change them to resemble her more. after that we started getting into the sexy stuff which i didn't really want to do but i haven't had sex in a while so i thought why not. she took of her pants and i smelt something very weird. i assumed its something outside so i closed the window. after a few minutes i took of her panties and i noticed the smell was coming from her female parts. i quickly looked at my phone and told her i have to get to work. i walked her to her car and ran back home. she messaged me for couple of weeks after that until i blocked her.

"for getting pissed that my (now) vegan gf refuses to live with me if i eat meat?. my gf and i have a child, due to financial issues we haven't been able to live together until now. she's been vegan about a year, and wasn't when we met, i have always been an omnivore and never suggested that would change. now that we found a place, she now says that she doesn't want to live with me if i don't agree to go vegan. i responded with this(https://i.imgur.com/rd4a9ck.jpg) after my frustration reach epic levels aita?

**edit**: our child is being raised vegan against my wishes but in the interest of compromise i leave it alone and made sure our child eats as complete a diet as possible. 

currently i only eat meat 2-3 days a week at most. i already agreed not to eat meat around here, my meat eating at ""our"" place would be limited to when she isn't there. 

i forgot to mention i have a child from a previous relationship that will be living with us, and that child is expected to go vegan as well.

**edit 2**: i agree with anyone that says my response was immature and counterproductive.

**update 1: we spoke and this summarized what i said:**

""yesterday doesn't sit well with me, your attitude towards it is controlling, and the fact you're not willing to even explore compromises is troubling. for instance, the few times i eat or cook meat could be done when you aren't home, i could get a small bar fridge to store meat, there's a million solutions that could have been discussed if you really wanted this to work. your attitude surrounding it is controlling and unreasonable, i am asked to make incredible sacrifices because you're unable to compromise, or unwilling to. this will become a pattern, because you know i want this more than you, and you won't have to compromise cause i'll cave to have our family.

you have a right to state how you feel, as i do. if you choose to ignore my feelings entirely up to you. but the lack of communication about this isn't going to change anything. i want you and this family, but i'm not rolling over and changing every time you decide you believe in something else, compromise is a two way street, and if we aren't going to walk it together as equals, in ideas, feelings, respect, and communication, then we say goodbye now. ""

**addition: i feel like i should add this reply i made to a militant vegan here **

~~https://reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/d2bg73/_/ezuc01f/?context=1~~

i replied to the wrong comment and now i can't find it.

**update 2:** all she's said to me is ""i'm dreaming of a future that i won't have. "" not sure what that means but i don't want to go down any more rabbit holes today. i think i'll try tomorrow evening to talk to her, i'll give her time to consider my words abs to collect her thoughts. right now i want to think about everything that's been said here, specifically about my younger child being vegan, my family, what's best for everyone, and most importantly what kind of future do i see with her right now.  i've read every comment, and this has turned into a very spirited debate. i believe there's merit to reducing meat intake for your health and for the environment, but i don't believe in extreme knee jerk reactions to anything. i have reading to do..

**thoughts:** i am not criticizing vegans, and in the reply (to the wrong comment) that's causing me to get hate mail, i was referring to a specific subset of vegans, i would have expressed similar sentiments to a religious fanatic that was forcing his or her beliefs to me. 

i support her right to live the life she wants, and to eat what she wants. i want the same accommodation. 

was i the asshole here? imho yes in some ways i was. is she the asshole for the ultimatum? possibly. what i know for sure is i don't think i'll ever understand how this ""lifestyle"" and diet is a reasonable justification to change the nature of the family at its core. 

some have called me a pushover, that may be true, but i'm trying my best to navigate waters that are unfamiliar to me, and to make the best decisions for me and my family.

i am reading most of your comments, and to those who say i'm being intolerant, i'm not, i'm seeking compromise. to those who say a child should be raised as a vegan, i agree and have from the start, that choice was made unilaterally and the safe guards and information gathering  we agreed to hasn't happened.",3

"neighbor's kid got hurt jumping over my fence. my fence is in good order and so is the grass beneath it, the jump itself is what hurt him. father is irate. need specifics on what to do.. i woke up at 5am this morning to screaming. my neighbor's son, who is 13, tried to get over my 8 foot privacy fence. he used a ladder on the outside of the fence and then jumped the 8 feet down. he landed badly and broke his leg.

his leg was visibly broken so i called an ambulance. i asked him to tell me his parents' phone number so i could call them but he refused to give it and i didn't want to leave him alone in my yard with a broken leg so i waited until they arrived. a police car showed up first and they did not want me to leave so one officer went to get his parents and the other stayed with us. the parents got over just as he was being put in the ambulance out front and the first officer was writing down what happened with me out back. his parents went in the ambulance with him and the police told me they would contact me if they needed anymore information. so i never spoke directly with the parents.

the receptionist at my workplace said that he showed up looking for me this morning just after 8. she said he was visibly angry, swearing and implying that she was ""hiding"" me from him (i was just not there). he identified himself by name and told her to send me the message that i should man up and find him before he finds me. they said he also specifically brought up that he went to my house and i have locked my gate, so he can't get in to see where his son fell.  they will be calling the police if he comes back.

i am hoping for answers about the following questions that i have.

1. based on the account from work, the father seemed extremely angry, even for the circumstances, and even a vague threat is still worrisome. i was planning to talk to the police this afternoon and inform them of what happened at my workplace. unless there is any reason i should not do that?

2.  i am intending to contact my homeowners insurance this afternoon and alert them to the situation. also want to confirm that's the right move.

3.  as i said he specifically brought up the fact that when i left my house after all this, i locked the gate. there was not a special reason for this, i just keep it locked all the time and saw no reason not to, the police had not mentioned anything about coming back for any reason. if the child's father does want to look inside my yard at the area where he fell, should i let him, or should i not? and on that note, should i talk to him in general or should i be going straight to have everything go through a lawyer?

thank you for any input you might have. i think there's a firm grip on this, i just want to make sure my plan is right and i'm not setting myself up for anything here.

this all started because i posted a selfie i took at the gym on my instagram story. it wasn't a racy picture or anything of the sort. it was just a mirror pic in normal gym attire, leggings and a tank top. i came home when i was done where he was sat on the couch waiting for me. he greeted me politely but quickly brought up the selfie, making a joke about how other men were going to try to steal me after seeing that. i laughed it off but he looked at me kind of weird. it was confusing because it wasn't the first time i've ever posted a gym selfie before. i have photographs of myself in bikinis on my page and i never heard a complaint out of him. i couldn't tell if he was serious.

he grew agitated quickly which is not how he's ever been. this whole situation escalated so quickly. he point blank told me to take it down as it made him uncomfortable. i said no primarily out of annoyance at his behavior. he posts shirtless pictures on his own page and i never got upset. we had a row for a short while when i asked where all this was coming from. his response was to shout in my face out of nowhere, ""i guess i didn't realize you were such a dirty slut."" 

i am not one who tolerates being spoken to like that by anyone. i'm not exaggerating when i say i have never seen him like that before in 3 years. i expected him to apologize when he realized what he had said. instead he started pacing back and forth looking furious. i asked him what the fuck was wrong with him. he got right back in my face again and said, ""i won't ask again, just delete the fucking picture and don't talk back.""
he was being so aggressive. that was when i really felt afraid of him. he is twice my size and very strong. i pushed him trying to get him away from me. he then punched me in the face, closed fist. i have never been hit in the face before by anybody. i fell to the ground where he kicked me repeatedly in the back and side. 

i was sobbing on the floor and he finally seemed to come back to his senses. he started crying too. tried to hug me while i was telling him to get away. he kept apologizing and saying he hit me out of self defense since i pushed him first. however when i pushed him, he hardly moved at all. i was terrified of him in that moment. i told him to get out or i would phone the police. crying still, he packed a bag and has been staying with a friend since. this was 4 days ago. we have not spoken despite his efforts to reach out. 

i have a bruise on my face and on my side from where he kicked me. they both hurt to touch. it hurts to even breathe too deeply. i've lied to friends about where the bruise on my face came from because i don't know what to do. he's been my partner for 3 years. i never saw this coming. i cannot believe that this is who he is because there were no warning signs that anything like this would happen. i saw myself someday marrying this man just a week ago, and now i'm unsure if i'll ever feel safe around him again. i know that everyone's initial reaction would be to tell me to end the relationship. however again, this is the first time in 3 years he's ever been violent towards me. i'm still pretty in shock. is it possible that this was just a one time thing? something we can overcome? i never imagined myself in a situation like this. any advice would be helpful since i cannot ask my family or friends.",7

"boyfriend's (21m) best friend (20f) hates me (25f) and wants us to break up.. i seriously can't do this anymore. this is half like a vent and half a cry for help. i feel like i'm going fucking insane but i don't know what to do. 

i've been with my bf for almost one year. we live together. things are going really well, this is kinda his first real, serious relationship so we had some issues at first, but we communicate a lot and he's a great guy. definitely the best relationship i've been in so far, outside of one thing and that's his best friend. i don't want to be controlling. he can have female friends, it's absolutely no problem. he had issues with a jealous and manipulative girlfriend (didn't last long hence why i said first serious relationship), so i don't want to be ""that girlfriend"" if that makes sense. 

i met his friend after a month iirc. when we first met she was very sweet, kind and incredibly bubbly. as soon as my bf left the room, she looked at me like i shit in her cereal. she started barraging me with questions who i was, why i got with my bf and a bunch of other stuff. it was like an interrogation and she kept cutting me off. when my bf got back, she went back to the girl i met. i was so shocked, i didn't believe what had just happened. every single time we've been alone together since, she has been a total bitch to me. she's never obvious about it in front of my bf, it's never enough to call her out. when she's with my bf she hovers around him, touches him or tries to be as close as possible. my boyfriend thank god tells me everything. until a few months ago they regularly gave each other massages.. he stopped it immediately when he saw my reaction.. friend keeps bringing it up amongst other stuff like ""remember when we used to xxx"". she has no boundaries, she will cuddle up to him and i can't get mad because i'll look like a bitch myself. today she came over for dinner, and she crossed yet again another line and i'm done with it.

bf was prepping dinner and she came up to him and hugged him from behind and kissed his neck and cheek. she was wearing a super low cut top and her tit 'accidentally' fell out of her shirt. later she showed her new swimming wear to us (????) and i could have killed her right there. i've told my bf about my concerns and he understands and listens, but he has known this girl literally since birth. i don't want to ask him to cut her off completely. he always asks if it's okay first to hang out or do something with her, but i almost need to throw up when i think what she's like when they're one on one. 

i'm so lost. i'm afraid. it's clear that she's into him (why in gods name did she never tell him this?) and she's told me it's only a matter of time until he dumps me.. it doesn't help that she's way prettier, younger and more adventurous as i am.. it would be an upgrade for him.. but he has never seen her act out to me because she is very careful about it. i've thought about approaching her directly but i don't see it going well.. sorry for my english.  any suggestions are welcome..",7
"i found a tracking device in my car. what now?. ny - two weeks ago, my car was broken into in the driveway of my home. i didn't notice anything missing from the car, but the inner door pull on the drivers door was broken off and left on the passenger seat, which led me to believe that someone had been in the car (rather than it simply falling off from me closing the door). the following week, someone left a bouquet of red roses in the door handle of my car sometime between the time i got home at 9 pm and 8 am the next morning. my landlord put up a video surveillance in use sign after this as an interim deterrent before setting up actual cameras. the next morning, the sign was moved. no one on the property has done any of this, nor have any of our guests. 

i was worried that someone was following me, so had the car combed over. we didn't find anything on the outside of the car, but i wasn't satisfied, so i took it for a second opinion. we found a tracking device wired into the wires beneath the stereo (near the footwell of the drivers side) with a sim card in it. all numbers on the sim and motherboard look like they've been scratched off. 

we were able to connect the sim to an old phone (it's a little larger than the ones in use today). uiccd for the sim and other information is unavailable. the device was on and blinking before it was disconnected. with this info, the cops have been unhelpful because they say it could have been installed to prevent a previous owner from defaulting on a lease and that consumer grade tracing isn't illegal. but the device is exposed motherboard and wires and taped into place, not what i would imagine a dealer installing. 

i've spoken to my parents about it (the only people in my life who would be interested in my whereabouts) and they're just as bewildered as i am.  is there anything i can do to have this further investigated from a legal standpoint? this is the last straw in a series of really strange anonymous harassment that's lasted for months.",2

"if i report a guy from the dealership who texted me?. i (23f) recently went to a dealership to get new wipers put on my car. i was there for all of 5 minutes while a guy who worked there (late 20s m) put the wipers on. we had a short, friendly conversation and then i paid and went on my way, thinking nothing of it. 

however, later that evening, i received a text from a number identifying himself as the guy from the dealership. he basically said he had a great time talking to me, and was hoping that we could meet up some time to talk again in the future. 

this made me really uncomfortable because i never gave him my phone number. he must have gotten it from my profile with the dealership. i feel like that's a breech of privacy on his part, and if he wanted to shoot his shot he could've just done it while i was there in person. 

so if i report him? i would have no doubt about it if he had made me uncomfortable during our irl interaction, but we had a pleasant conversation. i don't want to get anybody in trouble, but it just really sits the wrong way with me that he has access to so many peoples information and is willing to use it in that way.",3
"i'm a college student living in a van.. no regrets

i'm 21 right now and last year i got kicked out of my house, forcing me to get a roof over my head. instead of the usual route of finding a roommate, signing a lease, and being stuck on that lease no matter how low on funding i get, i decided to get a van.

i took out a small student loan, bought a van, built it more suitable for living, and have been living out of it ever since. it's probably the best thing that's ever happened to me.

for starters, living out of a van still costs money. you can't be dead broke and be comfortable with van life. i pay car insurance, gas, my phone bill, food, and maintenance. my monthly living expenses cost around $500~ per month. that's still as much as an apartment with at least one roommate and nothing more than my part of rent so i can't complain.

electricity is trickier. i don't have solar panels because i don't think it's 100% necessary and they're a dead giveaway that someone lives in the vehicle but i do have multiple portable battery chargers for my phone so that's never died on me. i also have a macbook air with a long battery life and a 2nd back up battery. during the semester i usually hang out in the library for 4-5 hours every other night and charge them both to 100% before i leave. i've never ran out of juice as i don't use them much in the van. my stove is gas powered and i have some battery powered items laying around. there's nothing i use that needs a heavy power flow. a 12v adapter would be enough for all of my items in a pinch as i have an upgraded battery and alternator. 

for internet on the go, i have a hot spot with unlimited lte data so i can average around 5-20mbps depending on where i am. obviously bigger cities get me better signal. i also have a external wifi antenna that gets great range if i need to park outside of mcdonalds or wal-mart.

food is all non-perishable and if i really want to keep something cold i have a 12v cooler that stays around 34ish f or i have a cooler to throw ice into. the 12v cooler is a pain to use because there's always a chance of draining your battery so you'll have to run your car every so often to charge it up in the middle of sleeping as a just in case but it comes it handy. ice in a cooler is preferred as it will keep items cold for at least 48 hours and then you technically could drink the cold water that's leftover if you want. to cook food i have a gas camp stove with 2 burners. it's great, i have no complaints besides gas being an on going cost.

combating cold is a lot easier than combating heat so sleeping in the winter, not so bad. sleeping in the summer, hard. i have a roof vent fan that sucks all the hot air out of the car but it only does so much. the night time is manageable but you have to go to bed later and wake up earlier to beat the sun or you'll fry. i usually move as up north as possible due to colder lows during the night but it still hits above 65f most of the time. i recommend pitching a hammock outside and use that for sleeping whenever possible as the car will be much hotter than outside with the windows up. also, using something to block out the sunlight in the windows but that only does so much too. basically, you'll get used to sleeping hot. winter is just adding layers.

stealth isn't always needed. i go to a lot of free campgrounds where you can camp right outside of your car so you don't need to be stealthy there. if stealth is needed, i usually just sleep in a wal-mart parking lot. my van blends in pretty well so nobody has ever given me problems. i've never slept in a neighborhood as that's just asking for trouble, neighbors will automatically know your van has not been there before and they will be suspicious. 

hooking up is actually easier than when i had a residence. download tinder and take a bunch of candid shots with your van on adventures, then upload them saying you're on a journey around america and just looking for short term fun. as long as your van is up kept, newer, and you're up on your personal hygiene, you should be okay. being college age also helps a lot as you're ""young and dumb"" instead of ""old and gave up on life"" but that's just my point of view.

income is different for me. my college is completely free with a scholarship but i'll take out a small loan for summer living so i usually am not working but i'll still likely have a serving job in the summers for a couple shifts a week. i work a lot more during school as i do not use a loan to cover school living. 

i love van living, i could spend a week on the beach drinking margaritas then decide i want to visit the grand canyon and head out the next day without a care in the world. i can spend my times in the desert, city, or rural communities. i could find myself at a number of national parks, hiking away, at anytime or in the middle of nyc or pitching a hammock in the middle of nowhere. every day is what i make it and that makes it so worth it.

sadly, after college, this life won't be as feasible anymore as i want to enter the workforce and live a ""normal"" life...",11

"by not knowing how much meat to order at the deli. this fuck up did happen today. for context i am a 23 year old student who still lives at home and isnt very good at being an adult. 

today i went to the grocery store to buy some convenient things to make for lunch, since i work a summer job trying to pay for school. usually i go grocery shopping with my dad, and when i went by myself today, i tried to pick out things that would also be good for him to bring to work.

i thought deli meat would be perfect, but i didnt want to buy the already packaged meat because i heard that the fresh deli cut is slightly healthier? i dont know. but ive never ordered myself from the counter and i dont really pay attention when my dad does it so i try to remember 

""dad usually orders....a pound..maybe? but that doesnt seem to last very long in our house.."" so i decide that it's logical to order 2 pounds of sliced ham. 

the lady sliced and sliced and sliced and finally she hands me a big, heavy fat bag of stacked meat with a price sticker of $13 dollars slapped on it, and i think to myself ""that's a lot of ham..."". then the lady says

""i'm gonna put the other pound in another bag""  and i think ""fuck thats a lot of ham"" 

so i spent nearly 30 dollars on ham today. which sucks when youre a student working a summer job to pay for school. i now think my dad probably orders half a pound or something. i dont want my parents to see what ive done, ive learned my lesson. so im gonna try and gift it someone idk.

here they are https://imgur.com/a/1fbas3l

tl;dr didnt know how much meat to order at the deli. ended up ordering 2 pounds thinking i was being logical. spent 30 dollars on sliced ham.

"by putting tiny, annoying noise making machines around my house and forgetting where they are.. first off this isn't a story from today, it really started on christmas. i'm a big fan of pranks and annoying my brother, so my dad got me 3 little machines, each about as big as a gumball. each machine has one button and once pressed they make noises once every 4 minutes or so, ranging from a phone's alert sound to a doorbell. the one problem was, i never figured out how to turn them off and i just assumed they would stop after a day or so. i hid them around the house, went on vacation to utah and had forgotten all about them, including their locations by the time i got back. these things go off infrequently enough that i can't hear where they are and on top of it every time the doorbell sound goes off my dogs lose their shit. i found one of them and threw it away because i couldn't figure out how to turn it off, but i still have 2 left lying around, waking me up occasionally and being annoying as hell.

tl;dr: i got three tiny things that make random annoying noises to piss off my brother, it totally backfired when i lost them with them left on and i still haven't found 2 of them.

"i sexually assaulted multiple women when i was a teenager.. every year my middle school would throw a carnival at the end the year. my 8th grade year i had been watching a lot of youtube videos on how to talk girls. what the videos boiled down to was be confident. however i misinterpreted being confident, with doing whatever the fuck i wanted. so during the carnival i would walk around and try to flirt with girls, and if they reciprocated with a laugh or smile at one of my jokes, i would take it a step way to far by grabbing their butt, or poking their breasts. i even tried to motor boat a girl. the girls would usually, laugh or smile, but looking back they were definitely uncomfortable, and were just trying to get me to leave them alone. fast forward a few months later, and i'm in high school. me and my friends were sitting outside after school, when one of our classmates asked us if we had any change she could borrow. i stupidly said, ""if you want my money your gonna have to earn it."" then proceeded to poke her boob. i started chuckling to myself, but quickly realized no one else was laughing. there was an awkward silence. the rest of the incident went down like this.

girl: ""what the fuck.""

my friend: ""what the fuck dude."" then proceeds to slap me in the face.

me: gives her the money in shame while trying to apologize.

girl: walks away without saying anything.

i quickly realized after this instance that what i was doing was definitely not ok. i somehow never got reported at all for this behavior, and was never punished, and i think that's what bothers me the most about this whole ordeal. the fact that i never got what was coming to me. it's been years since this happened, and all i can say is that i was a complete creep/ass hole back then, and i'm not even gonna try to defend myself. i've thought about reaching out and apologizing to the people i assaulted, but i don't want forgiveness for what i did. i feel like if i were forgiven, what i did would somehow become ok, and i don't ever want what i did to be ok.",11

donald thought that sounded pretty good, so the devil opened the door to the first room.

in it, was richard nixon and a  large pool of water. nixon kept diving in, and surfacing, empty handed.
 
over, and over, and over he dived in and surfaced with nothing. such was his fate in  hell.

""no,"" donald said. ""i don't think so. i'm not a good swimmer and it would ruin my hair. i don't think i could do that all day  long.""

the devil led him to the door of the next room. in it, was ronald reagan with a sledge-hammer and a room full of rocks.
 
all he did was swing that  hammer, time after time after time. ""no, this is no good; i've got this problem with my shoulder.""
 
""i would be in constant agony if all i could do was break rocks all day"", commented donald.

the devil opened a third door.
 
through it, donald saw bill clinton, lying on the bed, his arms tied over his head, and his legs restrained in a spread-eagle pose.
 
bent over him was monica lewinsky, doing what she does best.

"by letting my boyfriend finger me. edit: update here. (http://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/2feoep/tifupdate_tifu_by_letting_my_boyfriend_finger_me/)

it was supposed to be romantic. it was our last night together before he left on a plane, not to see me for months, and we were about to get groovy.

we were under the stars, kissing and holding each other and spending a long time on the perfect foreplay. it was fucking amazing. we were ready to fuck like animals and to make sweet love all at once.

we were naked and touching each other to build up suspense, and he began to finger me hard, leaving me moaning, but with an... odd... sensation as well.

   ""there's something inside you,"" he said.

   ""there's nothing, don't stop,"" i replied, uneasily. 

   ""no, there's something inside you. it feels plastic.""

horror chills my veins. it had been about two weeks since my period. but i knew then that i had left my menstrual cup (basically a plastic cup for blood/period gunk not to be left in longer than 12 hours) in for the past *14 days.* 

idiotically, i asked him to help me remove it so we could continue. mother of god... it smelled like an eviscerated decomposing body mixed with rotting broccoli, sewage, and rotting eggs all in one. and the smell did not go away. i threw out the cup and its contents, but the stench of 14 day old rotting blood and uterine gunk is not one that fades easily. i could tell my squeamish boyfriend was trying extremely hard not to lose his shit and vomit. but it only got worse from there.

the stench would not leave, and it was coming from my vagina. to try and bring the mood back, i went to the bathroom to try and freshen up. he joined me, perhaps to make me feel less disgusting. bad idea. with a feeling like an impending queef but somehow *thicker*, my vagina suddenly emptied a massive glob of this filth and it splattered a surprisingly large amount of brown rotted uterine filth all over my poor boyfriend's leg... he practically ran home.

"update to i really wanna sleep with my new personal trainer.. no regrets 

link to original(http://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/2azi9h/i_really_wanna_sleep_with_my_new_personal_trainer/) 

so after all the advice and ego boosts i got here, i decided to persue him. very unlike me since i'm a shy person, but something about him doesn't make me feel shy at all. 

he had previously given me his number (without me asking,) so i decided to approach him via text. in case he did reject me, i could always switch trainers and avoid seeing him at the gym. 

i said hey, asked if i could ask him a question. he said sure. with a smiley face. which i felt was important. so i asked if he was allowed to hang out with clients outside of his job because there was a show at a bar down the road from the gym. he texted back immediately saying yes and that he's glad i asked because he couldn't. 

ahh. 

so, last night we went to the show. stayed until about 1am, and we weren't tired and wanted to keep hanging out. him, being really sweet, says super shyly ""i wanna keep hanging out but the bar's closing. would it be weird if we watched a movie at my place?"" he was blushing like mad. i said no, and told him that i've known him for weeks and i trust him, so let's go.

it was cute. we cuddled up on his couch and watched a scary movie. he wasn't too touchy and i got the feeling he's not just in this for a physical reason. if he were, i think we would've just done it and parted ways. instead he had his arm around me and played with my hair until the movie was over. 

he didn't ask if i wanted to stay over, or if i wanted to go into his room or anything. he walked me to my car and asked when he could see me again. we made plans for wednesday. then he leaned in and kissed me. i almost fell over. we kind of giggled about that, i guess it was obvious that i was shaking. we kept kissing for a few minutes before i finally had to pry myself away.

i'm still wondering if i just got belligerently drunk and this is all in my head. so anyway, thanks everyone. this is actually turning into something and i couldn't be happier!

"update: my 36m fiance 38f wanted separate finances.... link to the previous thread:

link(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cimtl4/my_36m_fianc%c3%a9_38f_wanted_split_finances_now_she/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

so a lot has happened in a short span of time. frankly my head is spinning. i'll do my best to provide a comprehensive recap.

i got home the day i posted the last thread and i was prepared to confront her. unfortunately she and the kids weren't home when we arrived. my brother and i started talking and they returned while we were on the phone. i left the house to finish the call and she called 15 times while i was outside. i ignored her calls. 

i got back inside and the fireworks began. we got into a verbally heated argument but i refused to back down. she was adamant that i was disrespecting her by asking her to contribute to the house and that i wasn't a real man. she maintained her innocence throughout and continued trying to gaslight me. i wasn't having any of it and i think she realized she had lost her grip over me. 

she left the room, effectively ending the discussion. she slept in her daughters room. around 11 am the next day she emerged from her daughters room, got her bathing suit and some beach items and took her kids out again without inviting my daughter, who cried as they left, begging to join them. 

this is where things got wild.  she and her kids never returned that day (sunday). i assume they slept at the friends house who invited them over. i went to work monday morning and dropped my daughter at camp per usual. i picked her up after work and we returned to the house. literally all of their belongings were gone. she took about half the furniture in the house.  and a ton of things that were mine she has since refused to return. i was floored...

there was no communication, no indication that she was leaving, nothing. i texted her and she said she wanted time and space to think about things and that i needed to respect that. she said she needed to consider if she could be with someone who didn't want to fully support her and her kids...

i asked her for my $30k engagement ring back and she claimed she threw it in a lake!  i don't believe it for a second.  she likely pawned it or intends to shortly. after consulting my lawyer and family i called the police to report what happened and file a report for my missing belongings. 

the police have informed me that because she lived here for over a year and her license uses this address that the household belongings are as much hers as they are mine. my attorney disagrees and we are filing a civil suit to sue her.  the ring is a separate matter. as i understand it, that's a conditional gift in texas and if we don't marry it must be returned assuming i can prove her to be at fault for the end of the relationship. even if i don't win it will be a small victory forcing her to retain counsel and spend some money. 

obviously the relationship is over. not sure if she realizes that but i have listed the house since it's way too big for me and found a new place in the city. we move next friday.  i plan to live there while i get in therapy and fix my head. i don't think this girl ever loved me. i was just a bank account and the minute i cut off access to my funds she literally left. i've never felt so worthless and unloved.  i'm not sure how to recover.  or trust another woman frankly. i thought she was my soulmate. i love her and am still in love with her. that's how fucked my head is right now.  i just hope it heals with time.

"my (25 f) boyfriend (19 m) has ""masturbation contests"" with his roommates every wednesday, and says i am being ""sensitive"" and ""overreacting"" by not approving?. i was recently mortified and astonished when my boyfriend of 3 months told me that since we had been dating for awhile that he wanted to tell me about a ""weekly tradition"" he has with his 2 male roommates. (similar ages to him.) 

apparently, every wednesday, the three of them have a ""masturbation contest."" in this bizarre contest, the three of them all masturbate in the living room, standing next to each other, to see who can ejaculate the farthest distance.

i was disgusted and confused. my boyfriend actually seemed really taken aback by it, and he started laughing in hysterics when i asked him if he was gay. 

he says it's just a ""harmless game"" they all do and that it ""isn't sexual between them"" and that it's ""all about that distance."" 

i told him i was extremely uncomfortable with him acting in a sexual way with anyone outside our relationship, but he got really annoyed with me and kept insisting it was just a game. 

he even said i could ""be a spectator"" when they do it tomorrow night, and that girlfriends of the other roommates had been ""in the audience"" before. 

i was so mortified and astounded by this that i had to leave. he keeps texting me saying he is amazed by my ""hilarious reaction"" and that i need to ""chill"". 

i really don't know what to think about this. do i need to relax and let him have his game? am i being a prude?",7

"i invited random people into my house when i was alone.. it's christmas break in my small college town, and i've been alone in my apartment for the last couple weeks. today, i got a knock on my door at about 7:30pm, while i was trying to watch some hulu. well, i pull out my knife (cause i'm dumb, and think i can protect myself with a dinky pocket box cutter) and open the door.

it's two bible toting missionaries. i've already got a faith, knew i wasn't going to listen to a thing they said, but i liked the idea of not being completely alone for a couple of minutes. so i invited them into my house, and let them lecture me about their interpretation of the bible.

"my old college said that i didn't owe them any money before i left. now that i'm applying to other places they've sent me to collections and won't release my transcripts.. i went to a university in my state for one semester before withdrawing due to a lot of issues with them. in order to fully withdraw i had to get a paper signed off from the financial office showing that i did not have an outstanding balance with the school. i even triple checked with the financial office lady to confirm because i had withdrawn from a class which could have affected my scholarship. (i don't qualify for financial aid.) she assured me that i didn't owe anything and signed off on the form to let me go.  

over a year after withdrawing, i decided to apply to different colleges to finish my degree. once i started requesting transcripts from the college they said that they would not release anything because i owe them $8,000 and i've been getting calls from debt collectors about 3x per week. it took them over a year to realize that i dropped a class that would have voided my scholarship despite me telling them multiple times. they told me to pay online, but the online portal showed that they actually owed me money and that they were trying to bill me for a semester that i never attended. thankfully they undid the charges for the extra semester, but i still owe $8,000.  

i know that i have to pay them the money that i owe, but i honestly have no idea how to proceed. i'm only 22 and i don't make enough to pay them everything to get my transcripts in time for the upcoming semester. i will say that i do take some responsibility for not hounding the college enough so they fully updated my account but i feel like they also really dropped the ball...  

do i go straight through the debt collectors to pay off a little at a time and put off school for a while or am i able to take out a student loan to cover everything? like my username suggests, i am mega confused about what to do and any help or advice would be greatly appreciated! 


edit: thank you all so much!!! i honestly thought that maybe one or two people would reply so the amount of advice i've gotten so far is crazy. i'm going to get a copy of the form they signed off on and provide it to the debt collector. while i'm at the college i'm also going to try and negotiate the price down since they waited over a year and didn't give me any warning at all. if things don't work out i'll definitely be posting in /r/legaladvice",10

"my girlfriend is acting obsessed with this random family she just met. i figured i should ask for advice because this situation is really weird and i have no idea how to handle it.

my girlfriend ""maggie"" and i have been together for just 3 months so our relationship is still very new. things have been going well aside from this problem:

a few weeks ago, maggie started a new job and quickly became friends with her new co-worker ""joe."" for the record, i have no problem with maggie having male friends. i have female friends and i don't think there's anything wrong with that. but maggie and joe seemed unusually close after a very short amount of time. like maggie was telling me that she was scoping out her co-workers to see who was all business and who she could joke around with and maybe become better friends with. she said it would be pretty easy though, because joe was telling her who was cool. but maggie barely knows joe, so why does she trust him so much?

maggie and joe were hanging out so much outside of work that i actually did feel a little weird about it. i then found out that aside from work they usually hung out with joe's wife and kids, which made cheating unlikely but was still really weird. most people don't have near strangers hanging out with their little kids that much.

maggie has been putting this family above other friends, like when she waited on rsvp'ing to a friend's party until she could nail down other plans with joe and his family. the plans with joe's family were very vague and hadn't been decided yet, but maggie was willing to miss her friend's party if it was the only time joe's family was available.

i met them for the first time, and it was very bizarre. maggie isn't a big fan of kids but she was all over joe's kids. she got down on the floor and crawled around with the baby. the older kid was very shy and didn't seem that comfortable with me but she got very excited when she saw maggie and climbed into maggie's lap, so maggie has obviously spent a lot of time with the family in the past few weeks. the older kid calls maggie ""auntie."" maggie once told me she didn't like babysitting and always tries to get out of it, but apparently she has babysat for them, and she refuses to take money for babysitting. this is just so out of character for her. they also made some weird jokes about maggie coming to live in their basement??? which was really weird in combination with everything else that is going on. (hopefully that was just a joke).

for thanksgiving, we decided to just celebrate with our own families because we haven't been together that long. joe and his family weren't able to travel far to meet their own family, so maggie invited them to her parents house. that's very kind, but it was a couple hours away and they all slept over, so it wasn't a casual trip. some pictures were taken, including a posed one of maggie and joe's family, with the older kid hugging maggie's shoulders. maggie made a comment about how she was glad her ""chosen family"" could come to thanksgiving. it is beyond bizarre, she barely knows these people! she has been in the new job just under two months and somehow become absorbed into this random family. 

and this is so out of character. she told me once that she hates it when people she doesn't know well insist on hugging her or how cheaply some people say ""i love you"" but she is taking this up to 11. she is fretting right now because the oldest kid's birthday is coming, and maggie apparently needs to get that kid a birthday and a christmas gift and a christmas gift for the baby, too. the only gift i'd ever gotten a co-worker s kid is when they had a baby shower at work.

i don't even know how to bring this up. i know her friendships aren't really my business, but this is so strange it's making me uncomfortable so i feel like i have to say something, but i don't even know what to say. maggie cheating on me with joe would actually make more sense than this. any advice? this isn't normal, right?",7

i take issue with my mil being there bc while she has been very supportive throughout the process (unsuccessful attempts for years followed by several rounds of ivf) i'm of the opinion that this is one of those bonding moments for us and us alone since we are the ones directly involved in this event.  i'm not saying she shouldn't be at the hospital, or even come in to see her before the procedure begins - i'm fine with all of that.  but when it comes time for the main event so to speak, i feel it's time for her to head to the waiting room.  i want this time alone with my wife to laugh, to cry, to enjoy our child privately before they become a spectacle for everyone else.

i've learned quickly that pregnancy hormones are a very real thing, so i'm not entirely certain what to expect when this conversation happens again.  so i'm wondering if i stick to my guns on this one, or am i better off taking one for the team, sucking it up and letting my mil (in my opinion) ruin the moment.

washington — the internal revenue service today announced cost of living adjustments affecting dollar limitations for pension plans and other retirement-related items for tax year 2019.  the irs today issued technical guidance detailing these items in notice 2018-83(http://links.govdelivery.com/track?type=click&enid=zwfzptembwfpbgluz2lkptiwmtgxmtaxljk3mdi5njcxjm1lc3nhz2vpzd1nreitufjelujvtc0ymde4mtewms45nzayoty3mszkyxrhymfzzwlkptewmdemc2vyawfspte3mje0nji1jmvtywlsawq9zgf2awracnjtb2f0c2nwys5jb20mdxnlcmlkpwrhdmlkqhjybw9hdhnjcgeuy29tjmzspszlehryyt1ndwx0axzhcmlhdgvjzd0mjiy=&&&127&&&https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-18-83.pdf).

&#x200b;

**highlights of changes for 2019**

the contribution limit for employees who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans, and the federal government's thrift savings plan is increased from $18,500 to $19,000.

the limit on annual contributions to an ira, which last increased in 2013, is increased from $5,500 to $6,000. the additional catch-up contribution limit for individuals aged 50 and over is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $1,000.

the income ranges for determining eligibility to make deductible contributions to traditional individual retirement arrangements (iras), to contribute to roth iras and to claim the saver's credit all increased for 2019.

taxpayers can deduct contributions to a traditional ira if they meet certain conditions. if during the year either the taxpayer or their spouse was covered by a retirement plan at work, the deduction may be reduced, or phased out, until it is eliminated, depending on filing status and income. (if neither the taxpayer nor their spouse is covered by a retirement plan at work, the phase-outs of the deduction do not apply.) here are the phase-out ranges for 2019:

* for single taxpayers covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $64,000 to $74,000, up from $63,000 to $73,000.
* for married couples filing jointly, where the spouse making the ira contribution is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is $103,000 to $123,000, up from $101,000 to $121,000.
* for an ira contributor who is not covered by a workplace retirement plan and is married to someone who is covered, the deduction is phased out if the couple's income is between $193,000 and $203,000, up from $189,000 and $199,000.
* for a married individual filing a separate return who is covered by a workplace retirement plan, the phase-out range is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

the income phase-out range for taxpayers making contributions to a roth ira is $122,000 to $137,000 for singles and heads of household, up from $120,000 to $135,000. for married couples filing jointly, the income phase-out range is $193,000 to $203,000, up from $189,000 to $199,000. the phase-out range for a married individual filing a separate return who makes contributions to a roth ira is not subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment and remains $0 to $10,000.

the income limit for the saver's credit (also known as the retirement savings contributions credit) for low- and moderate-income workers is $64,000 for married couples filing jointly, up from $63,000; $48,000 for heads of household, up from $47,250; and $32,000 for singles and married individuals filing separately, up from $31,500.

&#x200b;

**highlights of limitations that remain unchanged from 2018**

the catch-up contribution limit for employees aged 50 and over who participate in 401(k), 403(b), most 457 plans and the federal government's thrift savings plan remains unchanged at $6,000.

&#x200b;

edit:

the limitation for defined contribution plans under section 415(c)(1)(a) is increased in 2019 from $55,000 to $56,000. (ie mega backdoor roth contribution)

the limitation under § 408(p)(2)(e) regarding simple retirement accounts is increased from $12,500 to $13,000.",10
"for deleting my moms facebook posts?. okay so to start this off, i'm currently in recovery from multiple mental illnesses including anorexia. 
     so when i was first diagnosed i was pretty much immediately sent to a residential hospital for a few months and i explicitly told my mom that i didn't want her telling people besides close family friends and relatives, and she agreed. fast forward to a couple months out of the hospital and i'm scrolling through my moms facebook trying to find a specific family photo i was looking for when i see multiple posts along the lines of:
    today we had to check our beautiful daughter into veritas for treatment of her ed. please send prayers. (not those exact words but similar)

update: damn i didn't expect this to get that many responses! just to clarify my mom definitely didn't have any ill-intent. we're very close and while we have occasional disagreements such as this one, generally she's very supportive. i definitely think we both made mistakes in this situation. thank you all for your input!",3

"are ""no haggle"" car dealerships the new norm?. interested in hearing other's experiences. i just bought a used vehicle at a large ford dealership yesterday. my father bought a used car at a toyota dealership recently, and had the same experience.

despite my best efforts, they would not budge on the vehicle price. the salesman kept referencing ""internet pricing"", saying it's already listed at their best price. now, the price had dropped by $1,000 from when i  first saw it last week, but they would not move from that price yesterday. he said the dealership is part of a no-haggle network of dealerships, though it isn't advertised as such.  it's been 10 years since i bought a car, so maybe the landscape is changing, but to me, everything is negotiable. i was able to negotiate on my trade-in, and get a deal i was happy with, but i was genuinely surprised they wouldn't budge on the vehicle price.

is ""no haggle"" or ""internet price"" just the way dealerships do business now?

edit to add: 

lots of good posts here, seems like there isn't much haggling in the used car industry anymore. to add some clarity, i had been searching for months, waiting for the right deal for the vehicle i wanted. my out the door price was below the kbb, the dealer is also going to buff out some minor scratches, and they filled the tank (30 gallons).  i still got a good deal, i was just surprised that they wouldn't go any lower on the price. in my past experience, there was always room to go down a little bit.",10
"if you haven't filed your us federal tax return yet because you owe and can't pay, file it by june 14 to avoid the higher late-filing penalty.. taxpayers who owe tax and file their federal income tax return more than 60 days after the deadline will generally face a higher late-filing penalty. ordinarily, the late-filing penalty, also known as the failure-to-file penalty (ftf), is assessed when a taxpayer fails to file a tax return or request an extension by the return due date. this penalty, which only applies if there is unpaid tax, is usually 5 percent for each month or part of a month that a tax return is late.

if a tax return is filed more than 60 days after the april due date -- or more than 60 days after the october due date if an extension was obtained -- the minimum penalty is either $210 or 100 percent of the unpaid tax, whichever is less. this means that if the tax due is $210 or less, the penalty is equal to the tax amount due. if the tax due is more than $210, the penalty is at least $210. the late-filing penalty will stop accruing once the taxpayer files a complete and correct return.

the ftf penalty does not apply to the taxpayers who met this year's april 15 deadline to file their individual tax return. it also won't apply to the taxpayers who asked the irs for a six-month extension of time to file, as long as they file by oct. 15, 2019.

in addition, the irs urges taxpayers to pay what they owe to avoid additional late-payment penalty and interest charges. the late-payment penalty, also known as the failure-to-pay penalty (ftp), is usually 0.5% of the unpaid tax for each month or part of a month the payment is late. interest, currently at the rate of 5 percent per year, compounded daily, also applies to any payment made after the original april 15 deadline.

after a return is filed, the irs will figure the penalty and interest due and bill the taxpayer. normally, the taxpayer will then have 21 days to pay any amount due.

if you are *claiming a refund* on your federal return and filing late, there is generally no penalty or interest charge.

"for essentially breaking up with my ex-girlfriend because she didn't behave at a gathering?. i couldn't think of a better, more neutral way of putting it, but that's essentially what happened..so yeah.

i dated her for about 3 months. she was really gorgeous ,confident and free spirited. i loved how silly and bold she was, it was something that made her really unique in my book. 
this whole thing happened a month ago. i had a really, really big presentation and i got really tensed. i had the opportunity to invite my gf to the function, and so i did, on the condition that she would not embarrass me and not drink, because she had a habit of drinking a lot during such occasions and losing control. 

well, turns out she made fun of me just because she thought it was hilarious. she burped loudly when i was talking to my co workers, and told about how i didn't even have sex because of the stress. she proceeded to ask my coworkers if they could resist her body. they were obviously uncomfortable too. the presentation ultimately went horribly bad at first because she kept making stupid silly faces backstage, but then i just ignored her for the rest of the night and all went well.

first thing i did when we sat in the car was saying i was breaking up with her that night, she told me she was just trying to lighten my mood. i refused to let her touch me then, and dropped her off to her building. she said she wasn't going to go till we sorted out the issue, i just told her to get out.
 then i gave her a text message saying i was sorry for being rude to her but we weren't compatible, and to just move on with her life.

fast forward to today, i bumped into a friend of hers who said that i had been an asshole for her to break up with her for being 'silly' at a gathering, and that no one could believe i turned out to be such a jerk.

now i am already seeing someone, but this interaction made me question if i had indeed been a jerk. an unbiased opinion would help.

i haven't spoken to him or anyone else about it yet. i have no idea what i'd even say really. i can't be totally sure it even was semen, but i can't think what other liquids smell like that. and he hasn't been acting any differently at all.

"by pooing outside. my room mate takes forever in the bathroom. i was desperate to do a giant poo, and held on for as long as i could. the situation was about to hit critical so i went outside with some tissue and squatted in the corner of my yard to do my dookie. it was tremendous, such a large poo. believe me, it was substantial. the highlight of my day.  i then dug a little hole and buried it so it wouldn't stink up the yard and attract attention, particularly the attention of my room mates pet dog.  a few days later i came home to find a trail of dirt and leaves inside the house. then the smell hit me. his dog had dug up my poo and brought it inside and was eating it on the living room rug. i yelled at my room mate that the dog had pood inside and was eating it - he apologised profusely, then cleaned up my poo.

tl;dr - i pooed outside, the dog brought it inside to eat, made my room mate clean it up. 

edit - hello internet friends, i am glad that you enjoyed my poo story. to clarify a few things
1) my room mate was moments away from discovering his dog eating my poo anyway - i didn't have a chance to step in and clean it up, thus becoming the hero i wanted to be. i panicked, then decided to make the most of a shitty situation...ha. 
2) it was very large. i have wondered what he thought of the dog : human poo size. his dog is a large mixed breed, but still. thankfully, it has not been mentioned and i remain innocent. perhaps i will tell him on my deathbed. 
3) to the people accusing my story of being fake news you are clearly part of the lying media. sad! no, for real tho, it happened. no alternative facts here. i am guilty.

"can it be rape if you don't have a chance to say no?. i (17) went to a party on saturday night with a guy i like (18 m).

we had some vodka and beer and we started kissing. we went into a spare bedroom and shut the door. after we had sex i expected to cuddle but instead one of his friends came in. the guy i like said his friend was lonely because his gf just dumped him and could i help him feel better. i got up to get dressed and leave the room but his friend grabbed me and covered my mouth then he forced himself inside me. 

after he said he knows i enjoyed it and we could keep this to ourselves. i got dressed and got myself home.

not sure what to do now. i stayed home from school today because i'm not feeling good. 

so can it be rape if you don't actually say no?",7

"my (22f) boyfriend (21m) called me by his friend's (19f) name during sex. sorry i'm kind of mad right now. 

i'll keep it simple. my bf has this (semi best) friend who he has known for 2 years. we've been together for almost 1 year. he hangs out with her sometimes and goes to the gym with her. i've brought up boundaries a few times, because i believe that she can get too comfortable around him (e.g. long hugs, sending him outfit pics). he brushed it off at first but realized i was serious about it. and i'll admit that i've had a very strong urge to snoop the past few weeks, which is unhealthy i know. mainly because they've been hanging out more, and i yes, i'm relatively jealous. she's fit and likes to show off. i don't *want* to see her as competition but part of me does.

so we were having some fun, and i heard him moan something but i couldn't hear it. fast forward a few minutes and he does it again, and he's saying his friend's name. i stop, he asks what's up. i tell him what happened, and he denies it. i'm not stupid, so i simply get up and make plans to leave. he then tells me i'm right and that he's sorry. still i'm pissed that he tried to play it off at first. he has apologized. i don't know if i'm overreacting and being insecure. the timing is just off, and this hasn't happened before. i've never as much as peeked at their conversations but there's an overwhelming urge right now for me.

"my son may not be my husband's.. my husband and i had been under a lot of pressure because his boss was making him work longer hours and i was struggling at home with our first child. since he was busy all the time i asked one of my (male) friends to help me put together my desk. afterwards we were sitting on the couch having a drink and he started giving me a foot massage. after a while he started moving up my leg and... i don't know.. we just... we would up with us having sex. i had been feeling really unloved and alone and he made me feel sexy. it was a huge mistake and i regretted it immediately. 

we had been married for 3 years at the time and we had a baby girl together and i was terrified of what would happen if i told him, so i kept it to myself. i immediately stopped talking to the guy that i had sex with and i've only really talked to him one time since. several weeks after it happened i started getting morning sickness and my husband recognized it and bought me a pregnancy test. he made me take the test with him and after we found out that i was pregnant there was essentially no going back. our son is 13 now and i'm still not sure if he's my husband's (biologically). i've never had him dna tested to check and never will because i don't want to know and i'm not sure if i could deal with it if i did. when i looked at him yesterday he looked a lot like the other guy and that's why i'm feeling guilty right now but sometimes he looks exactly like my husband as well so i'm honestly not sure. my husband has helped raise him since he was a baby so he will always be his father, that's what really matters.

"i did gay porn to support myself for two years in la remorse. i moved to la with the dream of making it big. i am one of the many who failed. 

i took everything i owned (very little money) and drove to la. i was able to rent a basement  studio apartment, a shit hole. i worked as a bouncer in my home state, and a guy i worked with gave me the number to an agency that supply's bars and events bouncers/security. the pay was shit but the hours would allow me to do auditions during the day and work at night. i found some shitty talent agency, at the time they promised me steady acting work ect ect. months went by, struggling to make rent, zero acting jobs, and then i hit rock bottom. my car broke down, and since i wasn't able to drive to the events i couldn't work. i used uber for two weeks straight and it averaged that i was paying more for uber then i was making working. at this point i stopped doing auditions, and i was in pure survival mode. 

i called the manger at the staffing agency and told him my situation. he asked me where i lived, and when i told him he asked if i wanted to work the door of a gay bar that was a hour walk / 25-30 min drive from my apartment. i told him yes and i started that night.  i should have left la that day. but starting that night at that bar kept me in la for the next 3 years. 

it was a medium size bar, most of the bar was a dance floor facing a dj booth. most of the people who worked there were struggling actors/ people trying to get into the industry. there was a lot of drug use among the staff and i definitely took part. i worked the door with another struggling actor, and we became friends. he was always flashing his cash around . he drove the nice bmw, always well dressed ect ect. one night i finally asked him how and where was he getting all this cash. he told me that the owner of the bar is an investor  in a internet company that shoots and produce gay porn. he makes roughly 1000-2000 a shoot, and may do one or two shoots a day. i was shocked, and even more shocked by his next question. i will never forget it. ""if you want in, they are always looking for guys like us."" 

i met with the bar owner the next day, and that week he set me up with an agent, got all the medical test, the agent payed for all the medical, the waxing, and two weeks from talking with my ""friend"" the bouncer i was on set for my first scene. i was going to be in a group scene and i would be payed 500. i was given viagra and i got undressed. when the director saw me nude. he came up to me looked at my dick asked me how big i was, and then   lhe asked if i would be interested in waiting 4 hours to do a different scene. a one on one and he would pay me 2500. i am 6'4 built, and i was doing a scene with a skinny 5'3 dude. it was my first time having sex with a man. 

the next three years i did about three scenes a week. mixed with all the coke and alcohol it felt like 10 years. thankfully i stayed clean in the sexual transmitted diseases department. but the life i was living took its tole. eventually i found help, and now have been clean and sober for a year. my life is still a struggle but i am in a better place. one day at a time.  

i regret what i did, how low i valued my self worth, for doing things with my body just to pay the bills, destroying my body with drugs and alcohol. 

it felt good to get this off my chest.

i like to think that i deserved to be valedictorian; that i am truly the smartest in my class. however, this past year has shown me that i'm really not that intelligent, and that there are many others who are much smarter than i. 


also, i'm kind of an asshole about how smart i am, at least to myself. i'm always telling myself that i was cheated out of an a, but deep down i know i deserved that b. not only that, but i should have gotten b's in several other classes as well, but i somehow managed not to get them.


recently i took the sats as well, which i got a 1900 on. i figured i was just being lazy, and could have gotten a much better score if i tried. so after taking them a second time, i thought i did much better, but i only got roughly 40 more points than last time.

"update oregon neighbor cut down several trees on my property, claiming they were a hazard.. hey everyone! by the examples i saw, it seems i should link my original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/72h3rm/oregon_neighbor_cut_down_several_trees_on_my/

anyways, rather than updating the original post again, i wanted to let everyone know where i'm at! this is beginning from the end of my last update on the original post, which detailed how i went to the police, found the company that did the job, and called the city to find there was no permit issued/documentation related to my address. below is the official update!


i have called a lawyer! after some in-depth searching and a few calls, i have connected with a relatively local lawyer (i'm a bit rural) and we talked for about an hour. he wanted all the details i had, especially when i mentioned the arborist; he asked for the number and told me was going to ask for additional information from the inspection that would be important for a lawsuit. he also gave me the number of a surveyor, and told me i should call them asap. he then set me up with an appointment at his offices next week after the arborist's visit. as far as the criminal charges, he told me that was my call, but we could talk more about it next week. he did comment that making a police report was a smart move, so thank you reddit for that advice!! lastly, he told me not to contact the neighbor anymore, to get a written/signed testimony from the witness neighbor, and to report any documents in the mail from either my neighbor or the company that did the job, as well as refusing contact should the neighbor come to my door. i asked if i could continue updating you all and he said that was fine so long as i don't disclose personal information (which i won't obviously!)

so it looks like i'm taking my neighbor's ass to court! i hope somehow i can get my trees back, even just having new ones planted. that area of my property is so barren now :'( i'll be sure to update if more information comes to light that i can share, and of course, if it gets there, to what happens when it's all over! thank you so much again for the advice!!!",2
"not moving out?. so i've (29f) lived in this apartment for the best part of a decade now. i don't own it but i've been saving up because i'm on good terms with my landlord who has agreed to sell it to me for a good price in the next few years since he's starting to get a little bit too old to deal with upkeep.

during this time i've had roommates rotating in and out to help afford rent. the latest roommates are a couple, dan (24m) and jess (25f).

a few months ago they announced that jess was pregnant and due in a couple of months!!! i was really surprised because, i feel mean saying this, she wasn't showing very visibly through her body shape. i congratulated them but when i asked what their plans were for their future family home they said they were hoping that i would move out. i said that goes against my plans that i've had for years and that i was planning on staying here. they insisted that i would ""have"" to move out as they're a new family now and need space. i told them that was great and i respect that need but if they wanted space they would need to find a new place as i was here first.

shit got pretty cold from there. we haven't really talked much, until now. they had the baby and it's now about a month old. i knew i'd have to bunker down a bit so i took all of my things from the common area (tv, consoles, kitchenware, etc) and with some work i got a pretty nice compact setup in my room with some diy soundproofing and a makeshift kitchenette so i can ignore the baby's crying. they used my stuff previously and were not happy at all and had to beg on facebook until someone got them new dishes, making sure to shit talk me in all the posts which i thought was pretty rude but whatever.

because i found out so late about the pregnancy, we're still on the lease for a good 6 months. they want me to break the lease so they can focus on their family. i told them that as i said before this wasn't going to happen. either they break the lease or they put up with me living my life the way i want to, which includes having people over, listening to music, smoking weed (legal state), drinking, etc. they said they can't afford to break the lease. i said that's unfortunate but neither can i. they said it would be easier for me because i'm not a parent and that i would just need to scrimp a little bit so i can afford to pay two rents. i said maybe but i'm not going to hamstring my lifestyle because they chose to inconvenience everyone around them with their kid. i was admittedly kind of the ah for saying this but i was being harassed.

so my living situation has been kind of a cold war ever since. it's really miserable for everyone right now and while i don't expect them to drop out of the lease i'm kind of hoping they do because them and their banshee kid are really giving me a headache. but i've invested too much into getting this place to leave so even if they stick it out i plan on signing the lease again and maybe seeing if the landlord will be able to not renew them.",3
"i 26m killed my girlfriend's 25f parents dog in self defense and we're on the verge of breaking up. this was locked by the overzealous mods on the other subreddit and i'm told this place is more reasonable.

my girlfriend's parents, who i'll call jane and john, have a notoriously vicious doberman, who i'll call satan, they refuse to train. it killed a cat in their neighborhood a few years back and has aggressively gone after visitors and neighbors when it gets off the leash. i've refused to go over to their house since meeting her for this reason, and as a result any visits we've had her parents came to us.

my girlfriend had a falling out with her closest friend recently and it's been a rough few weeks on her. her parents asked her (and me, they always extend an invite despite me never going) over for dinner and family time to cheer her up. i agreed to go as i figured it might make her happy to actually have me attend, but i told her i would only go if satan was kept in the basement (finished basement with a door) while i was there. she agreed, and we both spoke to her parents on the phone and they agreed.

we showed up and i had her go in to ensure satan was in the basement, which it was. everything was going great, john gave me a little tour and showed me their backyard and some bags of sand he needed moved, and the four of us started to cook dinner together. jane realized she was missing vegetables and asked if my girlfriend would run to the store with her, so they left. john asked me if i'd help him move the sand since neither of us are great cooks, and led me to the backyard, leaving the sliding door open.

about 5 minutes in i hear john yelling to ""watch out"" from inside the house. satan comes barreling out the patio door, down the steps and immediately lunges for me. i start trying to back up calmly while telling satan to fuck off, and he keeps making lunges for me. john (mid 60's with mobility issues) comes out of the house and helpfully decides to start screaming at the dog which only makes things worse. i kick at satan when he lunges for me, and he grabs my leg. i'm on the ground while john comes over and tries to pull satan by the collar and i try to push my finger into its eye and hit it in the snout and end up getting bitten badly and held by my left arm. at this point i yell at john to move back and use my pocket knife (again, rural area, not abnormal to carry) to free myself.

john is apologizing profusely, and said satan was whining in the basement so he went down to comfort him and he slipped out. he offers an ambulance which i decline, so we put polysporin on my arm and leg and we get ready to leave in his car to the hospital. my girlfriend and jane get home and start panicking and i tell them what happened as i get into john's car. both of them immediately rush to the backyard, my girlfriend not even asking if i'm ok, to tend to the dog.

john waited with me until i was evaluated and released and jane came in the meantime to tell us satan died at the shelter and to apologize. i asked why my girlfriend wasn't there and jane said i'd have to talk to her myself. when i got home, i asked her where she was. she told me with satan, and asked me ""how i could kill a dog."" no question about how i am, no comfort for what i had to do, nothing. i tell her i'm sorry, that i tried to back away, tried kicking it but it bit me. she keeps asking ""why"" i had to kill it, why i couldn't have tried other things, then accused me of killing it right away ""because i was always afraid of it."" this eventually made me blow up, tell her that her parents cared more about my well-being than she does and that i wasn't going to let myself get mauled to protect a fucking dog. she left and we haven't spoken since sunday, she's at her parents house and john called to check on me and told me they're talking to her.

so here we are. neither of us willing to budge. she believes i should have done more to get satan off me non-lethally and seems to think i killed it because i wanted to. i believe i did my best, had very little time or opportunity to react to a dog that had severely aggressive tendencies for years and while i didn't want to kill it i'd rather it die than leave me disfigured. i've grown up in a small town around free roaming dogs my whole life, i know when they just want to scare you and when they plan to rip you to shreds and this dog had murderous intent. i don't know how to communicate with her or make her see my side, and i feel betrayed and hurt she isn't even attempting to view this from my point of view. i understand she's going through a lot, but i feel like she's taking it out on me. how do we fix this?

tl;dr girlfriend's parents vicious dog attacked me, i killed it to protect myself. girlfriend seems completely indifferent to my experience and blames me for my actions, left home and refuses to speak to me. i feel hurt and betrayed. what do we do?",7
"for threatening to not allow my children to visit my parents alone if they don't stop trying to convert my children to christianity?. my wife and i are raising our children without religion. we've taught them it's a thing that exists and always answered questions about it as honestly and truthfully as possible ""they believe x... etc."", but we don't want to push one on them and try to limit exposure outside of media and other people freely practicing. 

my parents are devout christians and love our children just as much as we do. i can count on one hand the people i trust with my kids and they're on the list. 

however, they simply don't respect the boundaries my wife and i have set, assumedly because they believe they're saving my children from the eternal damnation they couldn't save me from. i feel their hearts are in the right place,  but the last time they visited for summer (we live in a different state from my parents) they came back speaking like we'd been raising them as christians from birth.

the most recent conversation went like this: 

""why don't you believe in god, daddy?""

""because he's not real sweetie.""

""but grandma and grandpa say he is!""


after this one i told my parents that if they keep doing this they won't get to see the kids without my or my wife's supervison.

"if i told my wife i know what i'm doing when it comes to our baby?. i have a 11 month old baby. super awesome little dude. i also have a 10 year old daughter from a previous marriage. i raised her as a single dad from 18 months to the present. 

i've been very careful to not tell my wife how to do things or how i did them in the past because she's excited to have the  experience of a baby and she's expressed things like ""you've done this before. this is my only chance to have a baby."" (i got the snipsnip shortly after he was born). basically i don't want to dadsplain parenting. 

this has led to things that i personally think are potentially problematic (ie she won't do cry it out even though the doc said it's time) but i'm happy to let her have her way so long as lil dude is healthy and safe. (yes we've talked about it and she knows where i stand on it. that's not what i'm worried about being an asshole about)

duuuuuuuuude. i knoooooooooow.


and it's been like that since the beginning. ""you've got to support his head."" "" you swaddle him too tight"" ( i didnt. that shit's supposed to make then immobile).

like i said. i want her to enjoy the ride. but i kept a kid alive for a decade almost entirely by myself. i don't need to be told how to put a pair of shoes on a baby or any other obvious shit.

"gillette razors deserve the coming boycot. in case you have not seen it, they just released a video where they use #metoo to shit all over men. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopmueyp3a0

but where is gillette's outrage when it comes to:

in education girls are leaving boys behind. in nearly all states more girls finish high school than boys. women are now the majority of university students, and earn the most bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees.

men are also at a disadvantage after school. research shows that they get fewer job interviews with the same qualifications as women. for example, if a male meet 40% of the job requirements, he has a 5% chance of getting an interview. whereas a similarly qualified woman has an 11% chance of getting an interview. 

when it comes to being crushed, mutilated, electrocuted or killed at work, men are at a distinct disadvantage. most backbreaking, dangerous jobs are done by men. the labour department reports that nearly 5,000 american workers die from workplace accidents each year, 90% of these deaths are men. 

criminal justice: a study by the university of michigan, found that men receive sentences that are 63% higher, on average, than females for exactly the same crime. women are also less likely to be arrested, more likely to get a suspended sentence and are released earlier on parole than men. 

what about unwanted pregnancies? here women have all the choices, while men have zero. a woman can give the baby up for adoption or even have an abortion, without the father's consent. if she decides to keep the baby, the father must pay child support for 18 years, even if he earns very little. a 2007 urban institute study on child support, found that 70% of fathers who could not pay, had to pay, on average, 83% of their monthly salary for child support. if a father cannot pay what the court ordered him to pay, he will be send to jail. a 2009 study in south carolina found that 13.2% of male prisoners were behind bars for non-payment of child support 

in america almost 50% of all marriages end in divorce. more than 70% of these divorces are initiated by the wife, with the main reason given, ""being unhappy in the relationship"".  not only will men lose half of their property in a divorce, they must also pay alimony and child support to their ex-wives for many years. men losing their homes in divorce proceedings, is one of the main reasons why nearly 80% of all homeless people in the us are men.

custody: divorced women are also more likely to get the children.  in fact, between 68% to 88% of the time they will get custody, depending on the state, mainly because courts view women as ""better"" parents. 

life expectancy: on average, men die 5 years earlier than women, due to stress and worse life conditions. yet, women retire earlier than men in most states.  

when we look at all of these factors, is it any wonder that almost 80% of all suicides are committed by men?

but no it is ""men who have to be better"". fuck you gillette.",6
"my (29m) girlfriend (24f) cancelled weekend plans to attend a house party, invited a male friend. am i being unreasonable in ending it?. last weekend i had arranged a week in advance for her to join me kayaking in sydney harbor as it's something she's wanted to do.

&#x200b;

she  asked to reschedule at the last minute  to attend a house party with a work friends without inviting me. i agreed as a free day would help me focus going to the gym and personal errands etc.

&#x200b;

the following day we saw one another and she revealed she invited a male friend who is not a work friend but someone who is new to town and has no friends. previous to this he had invited her to brunch which i expressed as not something i would do with the opposite particularly given she had to make it clear during it that she was dating someone.

&#x200b;

she had re-pieced her nose, and was acting distant the last few weeks. she stated he had a drink at her place and attended a house party together. my gut feeling suggested her inviting him instead of myself did not reveal much consideration for me and sat her down and said i would have to rethink seeing her.

&#x200b;

she said, she wanted to attend by herself, and that he asked to see her and she figured two birds one stone. she informed me without me having to ask which was good communication but was surprised i would see this as a disappointing action.

&#x200b;

she cried and i conceded i should give another chance, perhaps i was overthinking it.

&#x200b;

she has many male friends,some are long friends but some are men who to be frank probably are romantically interested and she likes the attention; as she's had a recent coffee date that he felt was a date.

&#x200b;

i spoke to her about this, and it appears she is unable to set clear boundaries besides communicating she is dating someone - as she has gone on 1 on 1 'dates'.

&#x200b;

i said, this is a boundary i am not comfortable with as it's not something i would do to my partner and perhaps we are not compatible.

&#x200b;

am i being too old fashioned in this regard?

&#x200b;

additionally, given the age difference, there is differences in maturity and values systems. at her age i was old enough to understand this behavior is naive at best or deceitful at worst as some of these friends have expressed romantic interest.

&#x200b;

note she pursued me after a break up and i was also just a male friend.  i said to her i also have options with friendly members of the opposite sex but i set clear boundaries with female friends. i know my value, and feel that her actions reflect that she doesn't.

&#x200b;

am i being unreasonable? i'd like some insights from objective third parties to see if i am simply holding her to a too high standard.

edit 

we just spoke and i disclosed that we were ending it. she reflected her perspective and we simply have different approaches to boundaries and other values which we differed on. she's a good woman, just not the woman for me.",7

his response was ""what the fuck man?"" i think he thought i did it on purpose. i apologised and left really quickly and haven't seen him since. i'm not sure what to do now. i don't want to go back to work. should i confront him about it or pretend it never happened?

"new mexico, my neighbor keeps calling the police on me.. about a month ago we got a new neighbor. i think she has some sort of mental disability. as near as i can tell she sleeps all day and is up all night. since she has moved in she has called the cops on me numerous times. multiple times a week.

&#x200b;

she has said that i'm walking around with a gun, i don't even own a gun. she has said i broke into her apartment and raped her. that i've murdered someone in the courtyard. that i've started a fire. that i've planted bombs in cars. many other things.

&#x200b;

these reports always come in when my wife and i are asleep. we get woken up by the police in the middle of the night. these encounters can take some time while they investigate her accusations. i've never been arrested for anything she alleges.

&#x200b;

there are 2 dozen apartments in our complex and i don't know why she fixated on me. i said hi to her when she moved in and carried a few boxes. she doesn't call the police on anyone else.

&#x200b;

the town we live in is pretty small and the same police officers have knocked on our door so many times they're almost apologetic now. i understand the police have a job to do, but it's getting old.

&#x200b;

i don't want to seem unsympathetic to what my neighbor is going through, but my wife and i work hard. i don't think it's unreasonable to let us sleep through the night. do they really have to wake us up everytime our neighbor makes a wild accusation?

"by possibly making a kid a paraplegic.. i'm fucking pissed.

i'm giving some passengers, a young couple in town, a ride to st. anne's. we're having a great conversation and coming down harry hines. we're on the left lane, and this city worker was coming out of a ditch on the right slowly, with his hazards on. this other dude is coming in at like 50 mph and slams into the truck. he cusses about ""where the fuck did that guy come out of,"" backs out and takes off. the guy passenger in my car takes pictures and gets the dude's license plate, and i tell the girl to call 9-11.

i park and the dude and i get out and go over to the guy. i didn't wanna look inside because the front of the truck was all smashed in, and i never get used to seeing someone dead. someone said he was out cold. his airbags deployed. then the post starts leaning more, and the power lines start stretching. the post cracks and snaps something and a huge voltage flame shoots out.

no one wants to move the guy because with a collision like that, you can seriously fuck them up more. then someone yells that the truck is leaking gas like a mother fucker and they keep a perimeter.

one of the scariest fucking things i've ever had to do in my life, but the thought of the flames reaching the gas and burning the dude alive... i couldn't stand around. i ran to the passenger side and unbuckled the guy's seatbelt and shouted at him to wake up. blood, drool, and snot are coming out of his mouth. he's fucked up. i can smell the gas, and the cables are stretching even more. so now it's not just burning to death. there's a possibility for electrocution.

so, fuck it. i run over to the driver's side and grab the guy. he couldn't have been more than 120lb and was about 5'8"". i never realized how heavy deadweight actually is. all i'm thinking is, ""not today. not today. not today. don't let me burn. don't let me get electrocuted. not today."" this dude was heavy and i'm struggling. the other dudes come running to help and we haul his ass to the median.

and the fucked up thing is that while all this is happening, i'm still thinking about that cunt that hit him just dipping the fuck out of there. this kid... he couldn't have been older than 25... could have fucking died and the other dude just fucking left.

a woman in blue scrubs, couldn't tell if she was a nurse, doctor, or tech, and an emt with a first aid kit were nearby (it's the medical district, after all) and we all tried keeping the kid awake. the emt asks his name, and the kid's just mumbling. i start talking to him in spanish. blue scrubs is telling him to stay awake, and we check his his torso. he's got a fractured clavicle... a nasty bruise on it.

the ambulance and firetruck arrive, horns blaring. although only a few minutes passed, that shit felt like an hour. i'm proud of madi (the female passenger who called 9-11). she gave perfect directions. i'm holding the kid's hand just trying to let him know... we're all letting him know that he's okay. he's finally conscious and speaks english. he's local. and he just starts crying.

""you're gonna be alright, dude. they're here to help you. you're okay."" his grip's weak.

then he says it. ""i can't feel anything. i can't feel anything. my back.""

that shit sinks me. i look at his legs, and he's moving them. ""you're okay, man. you're moving your legs. it's the shock. you're moving them."" and i'm telling him this because i'm a selfish, scared piece of shit and i don't wanna take the blame for possibly making him a paraplegic. but he was moving his legs. he was flexing his feet. i want him to know that he's gonna walk. he can still walk.

i'm pissed at myself almost as much as i'm pissed at that abysmal coward who couldn't face the destruction he caused and lambed. the paramedics get the stretcher and i gotta let go of the kid's hand. i tell him he's gonna be alright, but i just don't know.

the adrenaline is dying down. i probably stink like a goddamn dumpster. and i'm alone with my thoughts. i couldn't stand it, so i wrote this, because i want you to know that if this kid's a paraplegic, it's my fault.  


tl;dr: a kid in a really bad collision was knocked out. power lines were dangerously close to snapping. his truck is leaking gasoline and there's a potential for fire as well as electrocution. i made the decision to pull him out because i couldn't bear the thought of him burning to death or being electrocuted. but even after the ambulance had picked him up and taken him, no fire started and no power lines snapped, and i may have simply made his spine worse.

"i (26m) just broke up with my gf (26f). she was raped a year ago and my entire family hates me now.. for background, i have been with my gf for 4 years. i realise she is technically my ex-gf, but it feels weird saying that, so i will just call her my gf.

anyway we have been together for 4 years, and everything was amazing up until a year ago. she went to a party without me, drank way more than she should have, and was sexually assaulted by two of the men there. both men were identified by people at the party, plead guilty, and convicted. 

after this my gf's personality completely changed. she no longer showed any affection to me and was, all things considered, very cold to me. she tried to blame it on me since i didn't go with her, something which i have always found fucked up. even though she stopped showing me any affection, she got 100x more clingy in insisting i'm always with her, which wouldn't be so bad if she at least showed some affection when i'm around her.

we have never had any kind of sex since the incident. she very occasionally gives me a kiss, but only a kiss and nothing more. i can 100% understand her feeling uncomfortable with being intimate after what she went through, but she has made literally no attempt in the past year to work on this, or at least try and be intimate with me.

she has been going to therapy this entire time, but she is still as cold and distant to me as she was a year ago. i feel like she's not even my gf anymore, just a clingy loner that sucks the life out of me. i have tried to talk to her about how our relationship is suffering, but i have to stop because she immediately starts crying and asking me to forgive her, only for her to make no attempt to change afterwards.

as you can tell from my rambling tone, i am no longer happy in this relationship, and after making many attempts to help her i feel as though i need  to move on. i'm only getting older and i want to start a family and raise kids, and i feel as though there's no chance of that happening with her now in the state she's in.

so i broke up with her last week. i was straight to the point and then left without comforting her, because i knew that once she started crying and begging me to stay i'd eventually give in. i feel as though i've done enough to try and save this relationship and simply need to move on.

ever since this my entire family has literally cut me out of their life. my mother and 3 sisters all blocked me on facebook/whatsapp and wont return my calls. the only message i got was an extremely upsetting email from my mum telling me how heartless i am for abandoning my gf when she needs me most. my dad passed away a few years ago so they are the only family i have. i feel as though i have to go back to my gf, who in all honestly makes me feel like shit when i'm around her, if i want to maintain a relationship with my family.

i am considering buying a plane ticket to go home so i can confront my mother in person, but other than that i have no idea what the fuck i am supposed to do. probably a long shot but if anyone has any ideas on how i can repair my relationship with my family without getting back together with my gf, i'd much appreciate it.",7
"why would a man leave his wife and child to pursue a relationship with his dead brother's ex-girlfriend?. my brother in law was very sick and died about a month and a half ago. my husband came out to see him before he died, and i (and our infant daughter) flew out to support my husband the day of his death. the first couple of days were good. i took care of the baby and tried to be supportive of him and his family. on the day of the memorial service, we got into a stupid argument, and he banned me from attending the service. afterwards, he got very drunk and ended up in the hospital (possible suicidal ideation and blackout). angry over the situation, his family kicked me out, and my baby and i had to stay in a hotel, alone, until my flight back. while i was home and figuring out how to reconcile with my husband, he was becoming romantically involved with his dead brother's ex-girlfriend, the same woman who was flirting with him because he ""looks like his brother"" and had told his brother on his deathbed that she loved him. when my husband returned home a few days later, he announced he wanted a divorce and immediately proceeded on the process. that week i discovered he was indicating that he loves this woman, he is seeking a long distance romantic relationship with her right now, and is considering moving back to be with her and his parents.

i put on my sports bra which is zip at the front and has a few clips on the inside as well but because my mum was rushing me i skipped the clips thinking it will be fine. spoiler alert - it wasn't fine.

""guess what man!! me and (so and so) are having a baby!!""

me, being the unfiltered and untrusting idiot that i am.. replies 

""dude you better make sure that baby is actually yours bro!! get a dna test done immediately. she might be tryna get you to pay for another's dudes baby!!""

"for telling my sister about her husband's creepy af novel about me?. hi. made a new throwaway account to post this because i am... wildly conflicted right now.

**backstory:** my sister (4 years younger than me) and her husband have been married \~2yr, together for 5. bil and i dated during high school, and it ended under circumstances that were not ideal. bil and i have not gotten along since he and sister got together. my sister essentially believes i'm jealous of her for marrying my ""one who got away"" (he is not that), so our relationship has also suffered as a result. this whole situation is already fucked up and yes, i'm pretty sure it's putting my therapist's kid through college, but that's not the problem right now.

recently bil has begun reaching out to me more frequently. i've been very cautious but after talking it over with people in my own life, chose to be more friendly toward him as part of an attempt at repairing certain aspects of my relationship with the entire family. last week bil asked if i would read a book he had written, with the underlying implication that i would help him career-wise with his aspirations as a writer. out of politeness and curiosity, i said sure, thinking i would perhaps get a good laugh out of it and a story to tell my publishing friends.

the book... is about us. i don't know how else to put it. it's a ""domestic thriller"" (so think *gone girl, you,* etc.) about a man who realizes he has married ""the wrong sister"" and becomes obsessed with his sil. it's one of the weirdest things i have ever seen. it doesn't exactly read like a manifesto, more like something you'd see on r/menwritingwomen, but aspects of the story were deeply unsettling to me personally (touching on things that happened to me in high school and later), and i don't understand why he would give this to me to read unless he wanted to either creep me out, or - as in the story - he intends to leave my sister and wanted to see if this would... jesus, it's too weird to say. open a door with me?

here's how i'm conflicted. people have always used art as a form of cathartic healing. if a stranger handed me this book, i would just say ""not my taste"" and move on. that said, this is my sister's husband, and i found certain elements so skin-crawlingly uncomfortable that i almost didn't finish it. that also said, this is my sister's husband, and i am afraid, based on the past, that if i tell her about this, she will flip out on me and not him, and/or if she confronts him, he will also just lie about the whole thing? and on the off-chance that it's more than just tasteless catharsis, i don't want my sister to get turned into a skin suit? (there are no skin suits but you get it.) and if it is just a fictional fantasy thriller, i'll either look like a paranoid asshole or the lawmakers who tried to ban video games after columbine.

**tldr: my bil and i dated in high school and he wrote a really creepy novel about being obsessed with me and i don't know whether to tell my sister for the shitstorm it could cause.**

"does each percent of your phone battery last the same amount of time or does it drain faster as it approaches 0%?. this may be a dumb question because the word ""percent"" would imply equal parts unless it refers a portion of the battery that is charged, meaning that some portions could last longer than others, if that makes sense.

she is obviously going through some things right now which the school staff may be aware of. anyway... she said her vice principal made her really mad. i asked how so? and she begin to tell us how her vice principal began to search her for drugs. the vice principal found nothing in her backpack and then begin to frisk her. she said the woman was feeling on her breast in a way that made her feel uncomfortable and for an extended period of time to the point where the girl slapped her hand away and said ""ok, that's enough"". then she said that the vice principal told her that since she didn't want her feeling on her that she would have to undo her bra and shake it out. ok. she said she did it while having to keep herself covered at the same time. ok... then she said the vice principal also made her pull down to pants and underwear to prove that there was nothing in her underwear to which she said was very embarrassing because she was on her period. 

she asked me if this was legal. i told her i wasn't 100% sure and i asked her if anyone else was in the room during this incident and she said no. 

is this allowed? was this search legal? what should we do now with this information?? she also said her mom doesn't know because she didn't tell her.",2
"update: my 27f friend 32 is cheating on his long time girlfriend of 4 years with tons of girls. should i tell her?. previous thread, although the description was deleted(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a3feh2/my_27f_friend_32_is_cheating_on_his_long_time/)

original thread tl;dr
my pro-athlete friend was constantly cheating on his girlfriend of four years (now 5 years) with multiple different women and i was conflicted on whether or not to say something to her. the majority of our friends knew about the cheating going on but no one had said anything.





after i posted that question and read all the replies, i decided to tell the girlfriend. i didn't really know how to go about it, because i don't really know her that well. so, i did the cowardly thing and made a fake instagram account to send her a message on. at first i wanted to keep it anonymous, give her some proof i had which were screenshots of my friend bragging to me on snapchat and various other platforms about how many girls he had slept with that week/night. his fake tinder profile too. he would catfish girls on there and add them on snapchat to talk to them, sending them his instagram account so they can see that he's 'famous' and make the girls ""feel privileged"" that he's talking to them. ((his words not mine)). i figured i could start by not saying my name, and i would gauge her reaction then i would let her log onto my social media accounts and see for herself what her boyfriend had said to me just to verify what i had been saying was true. the conversations with my friend over snapchat were always saved, so that wasn't an issue about having lost messages.





so, this is the message i opened up with(https://imgur.com/je9v7le)
when i told her that other people knew, i specifically meant her boyfriends pro-biker friends who travel with him all over the world. they all know he cheats on her because they're there when it all happens. i didn't say that at first to her, but then she sent this(https://imgur.com/afwj64l)



after she asked me for someone else's name, i felt really bad just giving her it, so i messaged my friend quickly and asked him if it was alright to pass his name along and he said yeah. after a little bit of back and forth between the girlfriend and myself, i offered her my log in details to some of my accounts so she can see what her boyfriend has been saying to me. i apologized to her for bringing this all up. 
she replied with this(https://imgur.com/ioexzxg). i gave her my details, and then she knew exactly who i was. 




a lot more messages were sent to each other, and surprisingly she seemed to be taking it well. now by this time though, she had messaged my friend saying that ""some girl"" had messaged her telling he had cheated and that he needs to admit it. she was telling me that she hasn't mentioned my name at all to him, and she sent me screenshots of their conversation. he messaged her saying ""it was becky who messaged you wasn't it?"". my name is not becky. the girlfriend said no it is not becky, and asked who becky was. he said he slept with becky once. i told her this is a lie as it happened more than once, and that he will have millions of other names to give her, so don't just settle for the one name. 



after some more messaging, and giving her more details about things he's said and done in the past she sent me this(https://imgur.com/khubxff)

and this is what i said back to her, with her reply saying that he finally admitted it. here(https://imgur.com/ivmbddk)




i felt extremely guilty for causing this drama and telling her about her boyfriend, i couldn't sleep because i kept thinking about how i broke two people up. i can only imagine how bad she feels! my friend hasn't messaged me at all, and the girlfriend hasn't messaged me since either. i don't know if they broke up for sure 100%, but at least now she knows the truth about who she's dating. and if she wants to either end things with him completely or try work things out between them then i hope whatever she chooses it brings her peace. 




i think i have lost a friendship out of this, but i've come to realise that if someone is willing to cheat and lie to the one you love then you're probably a piece of shit anyway. 




tl;dr 
messaged the girlfriend about her boyfriend cheating, gave her all my log in details to my accounts so she can read what her boyfriend has bragged about to me. he finally admitted it all. she broke up with him. not friends with the guy anymore.


edit: thankyou guys for your kind messages and reassuring me that i did the right thing. you guys are awesome! and thanks for the silver :) ",7

"for turning the sprinklers on annoying tourists?. i live in a small town on the coast of nc with my husband and kids. the town is about 300 years old and it has maintained historical buildings and traditions to promote tourism and historical interest. our house is, imo, quite beautiful. google the hamptons white house, it's almost identical to that house.

as it's a historical area there are numerous tours to see the old cemetary, jail, courthouse, various historical homes. blackbeard once graced our town and his ship is actually sunken off the coast.

our house is near the historical district but our neighborhood is new and our house is not part of the history. a couple days ago i let my kids go out and play in the sprinkler in the front yard while i cleaned and after a while i noticed people leaning on my fence with their phones put so i went out to investigate. they said they were walking the historical trail and my house was so pretty they wanted photos.

i pointed out that the historical path is three blocks up and those properties have large plaques denoting their historical value. they said they k ow but my house was just so nice they couldn't resist and they didnt want to pay for the tour. i pointed out my kids were very obviously playing and they were half-dressed in their swim suits and their photos had been taken, and that the house was obviously a private home. i added i wanted the photos deleted as i didnt want my kids photos going off with them when they're in their bathing suits. if we had been out in public it would have been different but this is my home behind a fence. i asked how they would have felt if i followed them home and did what they were doing. they argued with me for a few minutes.

they told me they wouldnt delete the photos and if i wanted privacy i should have built a taller fence. they kept taking photos so i went to go back inside but as i did i stopped and turned on the sprinklers next to the fence. they were soaked.

"35/m my brother 37/m sent my daughter 13/f sexual innuendoe text messages more than once. this started ~ a month ago but some history is needed for context.
my brother was in a car accident ~20 years ago and sustained a tbi (traumatic brain injury) he has low iq, short term memory issues however he lives by himself alone, drives and has a full time job. his mentality is of a hormone raging 18 year old boy.

in the past year my brother managed to total his car and was in 2 more minor accidents in his new car. 

may of this year my brother was texting me several times asking me if he could take my oldest daughter 13/f to see a movie and he would drive them. i avoided the question and dodged it for a while since i did not want to come out and tell him. i was not comfortable with him driving our kids around in his car.  i mentioned this to our mother who told me to be honest with him. i finally got around to having a conversation with him about taking our daughter to a movie and i informed him i was not comfortable but if they wanted to go i would drop them off and pick them up. he seemed angry at the time when i told him this. i told my mother about this and she told me i talked to him and hes not mad at all and i told her that wasn't the vibe i got from him.

few weeks ago i get a call and text from my wife while at work and its screen shots from my daughters cell phone with conversations with my brother. 

1. 1st screen shot is my brother asking my daughter if she wants to go the movies with him, daughter says did you ask my dad/mom and hes like yeah but they said no do you want to ask again.

2. 

brother - what are doing?

daughter - babysitting.

brother-  oh ok

brother -  do you want to babysit me?

brother - i'll be a good boy

daughter - ok, i gotta go bye

daughter does not respond and tells wife about the text messages. who then calls / text me at work. im furious and raging at this point but i have a flight in the morning for work and will be gone the rest of the week. 

last week,i finally text my brother and ask him to stop so we can talk. i had to calm down and process everything so i wouldn't loose my temper. i get my step mom to grab all the kids and take them out for ice cream. so my biological dad, myself and my wife sit my brother down and we talk about the texts, which he said one was a joke but they other me might of sent but didn't read but cant remember. i told him his behavior makes him look like pedophile, i no longer trust him etc. ask him if needed help, if he was attracted to younger girls, he said no but i don't truly believe him at this point. i told he was no longer welcome to stop by with out an invite, he will never be alone with any of our kids. i changed our garage door code which he had. not sure how much of relationship i can have with my brother moving forward. i feel so mentally lost right now",7
"by watching orange is the new black. so pretty much, there is this thing in the bathroom. its like small, rubbery and weird. to put it blunt, i have no idea what it was. so for years, i gave it a squeeze every time went into the bathroom. a couple of times, i tried to squeeze it onto the mirror, as if it was plunger. and i didn't ask what it was, because it looked so simple. i thought it would probably be something people used for their teeth. hey, i was fascinated. 

now, on the tv show, the characters go to a convention for prisons, and the scene passes a shot about ""reusable menstrual cups."" there was a vivid picture and everything. and it looked exactly the same in my bathroom. realisation hit me like a sack of gross potatoes. i had put my fingers into a menstrual cup.

"i am the reason why 9 people are dead, and no one will ever do anything about 5 of them. remorsethere will be a **tldr** at the end of this post in order to not ruin it for those who wish to read the long form. people looking for more information than will be in this post may wish to listen to the podcasts about my mother's disappearance (officially, in fact, her murder): http://thinairpodcast.com/?episode=episode-2-marie-ann-watson-part-1

i found this forum a year or so now, i suppose. i've watched and read and lurked. so many times, i've started this post and deleted it. again and again... 

i've watched people say they want to die because they failed grades or they don't feel good enough for whatever reasons. sometimes even people with family say it, and honestly it breaks my heart to see that. i've also seen people admit they cheated and admit they hurt their loved ones, sometimes in quite bad ways.

i suppose i keep feeling like my confession doesn't belong here. i grew up with no one believing me. now, since there's evidence (since 1996) that can be pointed to, people believe me--but only what they want to believe, but not the rest of it.

yet i've lived with this almost my whole life, and it has gotten worse since they reopened the investigation into my mother's disappearance. learning what i have since then should have alleviated my guilt, but it made some things that much worse.

exceedingly long story unbelievably short ahead: 

when i lived with 'foster parents' from age 3 to age 7, i was abused beyond what most people can stand to hear described. it felt like an eternity of pain and terror. much of it was literal torture. 

part of the torture i experienced was brutal sexual assaults. one of the ways that they used to make me pretend to ""want"" what they were doing to bring me such terrible pain was to beat other kids if i didn't comply. it worked for a while, but i quickly learned that they beat the other kids and raped them anyway, so i quit complying.

eventually, the foster 'father' started to choke them. they choked us for punishment, though, so i still didn't accept that they would kill them. so... he did. the first one he killed to prove to me that he would do it if i didn't stop crying and pretend to participate willingly. 

the second boy he killed in rage, to get even with me. the third was because i just couldn't do it. i tried so hard to stop crying, but i simply could not. the pain was tremendous and there was nothing i could do. i watched as his eyes stared into mine in terror and then i watched as they closed. 

then comes the really bad, ugly, horrible part. the part that gives me nightmares and that makes me feel like a monster if i dwell upon it... the next two? they died because i decided that. i intentionally didn't cooperate. i looked into their eyes, and i saw the suffering there, and i believed we would never escape. yet here, they had a way to escape. there was, for them, a possible end to their pain.

so i didn't obey. at the age of 6, i chose death over life for two other people, with deliberation and intent. i did not kill them with my own hand, but they died by my decision. i was 6 or 7, and i played god. i prayed every day to jesus that i would be free, that i would be 'saved' in a literal sense. one day, i knew. i knew and understood that no one was ever going to save any of us. we were all going to be tortured forever--this was hell. death was the only way out... and they made sure i never died. i was blond and blue-eyed and fragile and thus a favorite to beat and rape and torture.

that's not all. that's not the end of people who died because of me. my mother was murdered by the same people. she was trying to get my brother and me back, so they killed her. if i hadn't have been born, none of it would have happened. her husband left her because i was born. proof beyond question of infidelity... my family never let me forget that i was the reason she died. i was the reason the marriage fell apart and when my mother wouldn't split myself and my brother up, he went to the same monsters i did. 

i destroyed all of their lives, just ask them. 

one of the foster brothers who i remember helping murder my mother is on death row in california now. http://murderpedia.org/male.r/r/rogers-ramon-jay.htm he was taught how to murder and how to get away with it... because of me. he went on to almost get away with 3 other murders because he learned from killing my mother how to get away with it... 

before my mother died, i begged her to take me with her. to leave and never come back and just hide us... you see, the fosters warned me that they'd kill anyone who tried to take us away from them.... i asked her to take me away and then they butchered her. i have lived with that pain and guilt and shame for most of my life. sometimes it still burns inside me.

so when i see people saying how worthless they are, how horrible and how they don't deserve love or happiness... i can't help but wonder... when i am so much worse than they, do i also not deserve love, happiness, or hope?

i don't want to be told all the nonsense of how it wasn't my fault. the mind knows, and sometimes so does the heart, but not always. i don't want to be told that i was just a kid. i was never just a kid. not a single day in my entire life.

**tldr**

i was violently sexually abused and during that time, it was ""pretend to enjoy the agony or we'll kill these kids"" and so the kids died, because i simply couldn't at first and then later i decided they were better off dead than living in the hell we were in. my mother was murdered trying to get me back and then as a result of that, one of the murderers went on to kill more people since he learned how to get away with it (but he didn't get away with their deaths). i was the reason my mother's marriage broke up and she was in that situation to begin with (according to my family). **end tldr**

the police won't do anything because they can't prove anything. nobody believes me, anyway. so i will live with this for the rest of my life and that's that. there's nothing i can do, and nobody cares about those children. i am hopeless to ever see resolution to any of it, and every once in a while i am okay... but sometimes... sometimes i'm not quite okay. 

i have nobody to talk to about it. i talked with shrinks of various types and i have one now... but it doesn't help and it's beyond the realm of what even most of them can cope with. 

sometimes, i wish my life wasn't so horrific that other people can't even hear about it. sometimes, i wish someone would sit and listen and not disbelieve me. sometimes, i just want to be normal and not sit there listening to someone tell me how horrible they are while i sit there knowing how much worse i am, have been since i was a child. sometimes, i want to pretend i'm someone else. to pretend that my parents were happy married all their lives and just recently died and that i'm normal and everything's fine and nothing ever happened... 

i also sometimes want to punch people in the face for telling me how strong i am when i'm crying inside and aching and feel sad, pathetic, and far too fragile.

and at times, i despise people who have family and they don't even know. they don't even have a clue what it's like to live an entire lifetime without any at all. they hurt their family and sometimes they even gloat about it. they sit there and look me in the face and tell me how they hurt a family member and they don't know that they're talking to a person who, as a child, squatted at the corner of a building and watched while her own mother was butchered like an animal... their life is so very hard because their parents are angry, you see... or because their sister lied, or because they found out that their parent had an affair... 

it could be worse. ",11

"my mother died with no money or assets. father is immobile in a 100% ssi facility. what do i do about the collectors? i'm so lost.. my mother died in december (in florida if it matters). while my absolute hero and probably the best person i'll ever know, she had extremely bad health problems that occurred in 2007. parents tried, but it was a long roll down hill. house was lost, no real possession, etc. father fell sick and has been in a full time care facility for 2+ years now, and she was disabled for probably close to a decade. she rented a tiny space, had a junker car, and owned nothing. her bank account was fully government funded. it was a small and simple life, but she was happy. 

before her death, she had a wicked fall. a fall that broke her eye socket and lead them to discover a bleed in her brain. this all happened in wisconsin while visiting family. she was treated for weeks, and eventually cleared to come home. she's home for a few months and passes away. i currently have all of her mail forwarded to me. **there are so many collectors.** those people want to be paid. 

what should i do? she died with nothing: no insurance, her bank account had $73, owned no property, etc. i did the simplest cremation, which still cost more than her old van was worth. 

i was thinking i should send each one a copy of her death certificate, but do i need to? there isn't an estate to go after. should i send it out of courtesy?

"by making indian food and making the same mistake 78% of people make whilst impressing girls with dinner.. throwaway because she knows my reddit handle but this happened about 1h30 mins ago. buckle up because it turned out kinda long. 

&#x200b;

so i've been seeing a nice, athletic and 100% my-type lady for almost a month - nothing too serious, though. it was her birthday on tuesday, but she never mentioned it to me and i don't really dabble in the social media shitshow, so i didn't know until she mentioned she'd been snowboarding for it. she didn't want me to make a big fuss because we're still kinda fresh and she had to work, so i said i'd take her out for dinner at the weekend (aka today) and that was that. flashback to last night, she said she'd rather me make her my favourite ""british"" food for dinner and we can watch a movie at my apartment. all good.

&#x200b;

so flash forward to today. i'm a brit, living on the west coast of canada, and finding authentic indian food is hard because everywhere i go seems to be super whitewashed. so great lightbulb idea, lets make her biryani! as a human milk bottle, i will still toot my own horn whenever i have the opportunity to make indian food so it seemed like the best food to impress. 

&#x200b;

so i made biryani about 4h ago. she said she didn't like cardamom pods, cloves or cassia bark, so i picked them out of the pre-mixed mix (i mix the mix every couple of months so i don't have to measure each time) and decided to add some red chilli peppers just to add a bit of flavour. those small but very lethal fuckers. obviously, this includes slicing them.

&#x200b;

just as a side note: i'm female and i know how bad it feels when you get that tingly burning feeling on your tinka winka. i have also read 10s of tifu's where we're all just trying our best to please the lady in our lives and it ends up with mt vesuvius vagina. thirdly, i've done it before, to myself, and it's rough. to combat this, i washed my hands literally 12 times thinking it would be ok. 

&#x200b;

so we ate dinner about 3.5h ago and put on a movie. once we'd finished eating, one thing obviously led to another, the sofa was reclined and fun was being had. the fun lasted less than 5 minutes before she mentioned that her pompeii pussy was on fire and went to soak in the bath for 1h. we both found it hilarious at the time, but she left 20 minutes ago with a yogurt vag and has yet to text me. i apologized a lot so i'm sure she'll come round.

"by getting my whole family mega high on edibles for 48 hours over christmas. so as the title says this wasn't today, it all started on christmas eve. i'll set the scene, it's christmas eve at my family home with my parents, brother, sister, my gf and my brothers gf. all of us are in our early 20s, besides my parents who are mid 50s. they have never had a problem with us smoking weed and would do it with us on occasion. a few months before, me and my gf had made a batch of edibles and got pretty high off them but nothing too crazy. so on christmas eve i thought it would be a great idea to make a new batch of similar strength and get the whole family high as we are rarely all together as all us kids are at different universities. 

so i start making the edibles but i can't remember exactly how much weed i used in the first batch. i had 6 grams on me and used it all as there was 7 of us so nothing too crazy, or so i thought. now when we made the first batch me and my gf cut the brownies into 12 pieces and only ever had 1 at a time. however my mum has a fancy brownie maker which cuts them for you into 9 pieces. so straight away i knew these would be a bit stronger than before but still i didn't think they would be that strong, boy was i wrong. so i finish baking the brownies at around 2pm on christmas eve and the family descends on them like a plague of locusts. 

half an hour goes by and no one is feeling anything. mum is just about to serve up dinner, we had it early as we knew no one would be able to make it later. we sit down to start eating and then one by one we start to feel it. my dad, who has a history of passing out after smoking weed, finished his dinner in a matter of seconds and crawls off to the sofa as he ""can't stand up"" and needs to ""lie down"". so off he goes and about 15 minutes later we finish our dinner and go to see where he has got too. we walk into our lounge to discover him already asleep on the sofa. so about 20 more minutes go by and we are all feeling pretty high at this point. my mum starts freaking out and saying she ""doesn't like this at all"" and needs some way to stop the high. i tell her that there is no way to stop it and to just ride it out. 

after about another 30 minutes my dad suddenly gets up from the sofa like he's the undertaker and dashed off to the kitchen as he ""needs more food"". he then proceeds to make about 15 slices of toast for everyone to eat as well as about 5 for himself. at this point we realise that no one has wrapped any presents yet and my 85 year old grandmother is coming round for christmas tomorrow. so we hastily try to wrap some presents but no one really gets anything done as by this point no one can even stand up anymore. 
now me and my brother are seasoned stoners but even we can't move more than 2 steps before falling to the floor and needing 15 minutes rest to get up again. we decide that the only thing we can do is to try and sleep it off and hopefully we feel better in the morning. so after a while of all 7 of us struggling up the stairs we finally make it into our beds and try to sleep it off. 
we all wake up on christmas day still whacked out of our minds and not able to function properly. we then realise that we have to go and pick up my brothers friend up who is joining us for christmas but none of us are in any state to drive. so, after explaining to my grandmother that none of us can drive to pick up the friend as we are all too high to move, we had to call an uber to bring the friend to us which cost a small fortune as it was christmas as he was about 25 miles away. so we soldier on through christmas all of us trying to just not be high anymore and we finally make it to the end of the day still high as a kite. 

we go to sleep and wake up the next stay and guess what, we're still high as fuck. i genuinely thought it would never end but eventually later that day we all started coming back down to planet earth. so yeah, i ruined christmas by getting my whole family too high to move.

update: people are asking for more things that happened so i'll share a few with you. as i replied to one comment my mum was answering the tv every time someone on the tv asked a question.

this next one needs a little context. in our kitchen we have an aga. this is basically a fancy oven that is always on as a way to heat up the house. i never use it as the temperature isn't consistent and i always burn anything that i put in it. this is because i don't know what temperature it is and my mum always says it's around 200 degrees celsius. my mum always has a go at me whenever i use the regular oven as it's ""wasteful"". with that out the way i'll get to the funny bit. this was right before mum served up dinner. she got the yorkshire puddings out of the aga and they were completely burnt. i ask why they are burnt if she knows the temperature and she looks me dead in the eye and says ""i have no idea what the temperature of the aga is"". this was enough to send us both into fits of laughter for about 5 minutes.

update 2: thank you for the gold kind stranger! 

update 3: for those saying this story isn't true i can 100% guarantee that it is. 

update 4: wow my first platinum! thank you so much!

my dad died 5 years ago, mom died 6 months ago. we are now the owners of this house.

we've been visited by the hoa multiple times, they're citing that we're not a single-family home anymore since our mom has died. they've told us that according to the terms, only a single family can be resident in the homes and being single family is defined as a person or couple and their legal unmarried children. this meant that my mom could live with me and my sister as it was a single family according to the definition, but me and my sister living here after our mom's death means we are two families of single adults. they want one of us to move out so that this place becomes a single family home again.

they've visited us four times now asking us to leave. they say they don't like to sue our of respect for our parents but they will do that if we continue to refuse to comply by the community rules.

"hunters do more for conservation and the ecosystem than any other group.. i have an anti-hunting co-worker who doesn't like my logic, which prompted this post. hunters pay almost $800 million per year in licensing, permits and fees. hunters donate approximately $400 million per year to organizations for conservation. hunters pay an 11% tax through the pittman robertson act on hunting gear, guns, ammo, etc., which generates another almost $400 million per year. on top of that, they hunt animals according to regulations (there are poachers - each group has some assholes in it, right?) that are put in place by biologists whose career is literally to determine how many of a species should be hunted to create the best habitat for these animals. if hunters don't kill a certain number of deer, turkeys, ducks, etc., the ecosystem cannot maintain, they would eat more than nature can hold and would ultimately cause more problems by drifting into neighborhoods (for those of you who hit one with your car, this would happen more) and would die of starvation due to lack of food source. the people in states that have banned hunting because of public outcry don't realize that now instead of having hunters participate and pay money in taxes and fees etc. to the state, the state now hires people to kill the same amount of animals in order to keep a sustainable level (i.e., california and black bears). instead of raising money, they are now using taxpayers money. 

&#x200b;

also, for those that think hunters are only after trophies, that's incorrect. hunters usually take animals that have bred the most and are older in life, making room for younger generations to breed. this happens to be those with the biggest antlers, as that's a sign of an older buck/bull. 

&#x200b;

for those that attack hunters who go overseas to take big game, they are paying usually in the tens of thousands, if not more, in order to have that hunt. those programs are specifically put into place to take out an old aggressive animal (already picked prior to paying for your hunting tag) and to give that local government enough money to continue to pay for conservation throughout the year. hunters are not waltzing off into the desert and killing a bunch of lions on a whim. people need to be more educated prior to making bold statements like hunting is bad. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr - hunters pay more for conservation than any other group; hunting is necessary to keep amount of animals at bay to sustain for the future.",6

"tifu by accidentally becoming gay on new years. well here goes, t'was the night of new years and i was at a friends place just outside of town. our group had planned on having this sort of ""grown up night"" instead of a new years party. we had planned on getting together making a three course dinner and playing games and just enjoying ourselves. yeah i know. (the reason being is that the majority of us in this group of 13 are in relationships. 5 couples and 3 single boys to be exact) anyways as the night went by we kept joking about having no new years kiss and so on and me and my friend, we'll call him dave, start joking about being each others new years kiss.

okay you need to have this in mind: i'm a guy who's not really into the hummus business but i don't really back off when it comes to kissing dudes or making out with another with them for that matter. i figure ""hey thats just another person, kissing another dude doesn't mean i enjoy getting my plum penetrated by another mans love stick. 

anyways the count down begins and we just go for it (just a small kiss on the lips and nothing more). just for the sake of the meme we hold each other, in an unholy position that only love birds whom are about to marry one another should hold, and start enjoying the fireworks. at this point one of the so called ""females"" notices us and starts to laugh and doesn't believe that we actually kissed so just to fuck with her we go at each other as if our life depended on it. someone films this on the platform know to man as snapchat and sends it to world with the caption ""so glad they finally came out"". the night continues and so does the party.

the next day me and dave are in town and enjoying our afterparty tradition which is hungover kebab-pizza with extra garlic sauce and this random couple (16 or something, my little sisters friends) congratulate us. we don't think of it much and just assume they mean new year. we go home to my place to play some video games and hangout and thus my father happens. he congratulates us as well and tells dave he's glad that i chose him out of all the other people in an awkward manner. i still haven't got it but dave's laughing his ass off. i ask my dad if he can leave us alone and he tells me ""oh i see you want some space to do your thing now that there's no hiding it."" and winks. that's when i realize and panic. it turns out some asshole saved the snapchat video (somehow) and shared it on facebook. being in a small town, everyone wanted to show that they're tolerant and fund of these so called ""hummus-people"" so everyone liked and shared the video.

it's january the 2nd and everywhere i go people congratulate me. yayy. i guess i'm a gay now.

edit: well that escalated quickly. yay we managed to get the comments locked. 

edit 2: eyyy thanks for the gold random stranger. i literally have no clue what to do with reddit gold though.

tldr: made out with a friend (guy) on new years as a joke. it went viral. everyone in my town thinks i'm homosexual. i guess i'm gay now.

"by ejaculating on my sergeant's night snack nsfw. this happened about two years ago and it's been heavy on my mind ever since. i would like to speak about it to ease the burden and please don't judge me too much for being a retard.

two years ago, i was serving national service in singapore(mandatory for all males) and after a couple of months of vocational training, i was sent to a cool unit where i would spend the rest of my time until i completed my national service(two years in total). it was a small unit with fewer than twenty people in total and we had to work a full day's shift with a sergeant and two enlisted men. all three of us were conscripted soldiers bidding our time. cutting out the technical details - the three of us worked in an isolated room where we had to be there for twenty four hours for the duration of our shift.

we were not allowed to leave this room and it came with an attached bathroom for us to shower and pee/poop. breakfast, lunch, dinner, and night snack would be sent to us by an external staff and we would return the food bag the following day when we were done with our duty. it gets really boring as trouble was extremely unlikely to happen and we basically sat all day talking and idling. when it was night time, the sergeant would sleep till morning and the two enlisted men would take turns to monitor the system.

one night, my fellow enlisted man was having a headache and i volunteered to cover the night shift on my own so he could rest. i was extremely bored as we didn't have any internet access and mobile phones were prohibited. i just laid idly and waited for the time to pass. this was right about three in the morning and i had another three hours to kill. i was also extremely horny as i hadn't had a release in a while(single, prostitution was a once a month luxury). 

i had read an ex-convict's blog about how they used to release their sexual tension by stealing hotdog buns and use it to masturbate and was curious to give it a go(brain fart!). right then, i remembered we had hotdogs for night snack and figured trying it out since i had nothing to do at that time. i used the bun and pleasured myself and came in it after a while. we didn't have rubbish bins as to prevent rodents and had to keep our trash in the food bag so i quickly placed the sausage back in the bun and placed it in the food bag. we have separate food bags for each meal and i figured once we had to change shift, i would bring all the food bags out and get rid of the bun. 

here is the part i fucked up. i was so tired after the action that i dozed off at the desk. when i woke up, i realise it was morning and people had started walking around. half-awake, i quickly glanced around and realised all the food bags were gone. that sight got me up real fast and i asked where were the bags and the other man told me that my sergeant cleared them. to my horror, he said my sergeant had eaten the night snack in the morning as he was hungry and could not wait till the shift was over for breakfast.

i was fucking shitting my pants and hoped he wouldn't suspect anything. he came in later to tell us we could get ready to leave and nothing was out of place. he was acting normally and we went home after. i couldn't sleep for weeks and tried avoiding duties with him after the incident.

i felt really bad but i dared not tell him what had happened and i was pretty sure i would be sent to military prison. ever since, i gave up eating hotdogs entirely. 

tldr: masturbated in night snack(hotdog bun) and failed to clear it in time before sergeant ate it for breakfast",4
"nurses aides were abusing patients so my sister reported it and is now receiving threats from hr that they will take her license away. i am writing this on behalf of my sister. 

my sister has a bachelors in nursing and has been working as a nurse at a senior care community place in minnesota for a couple of years. 

a month ago she witnessed two of the aids verbally abusing a patient. many patients have complained to my sister about how these aides treating them. my sister sent an email to the director of the facility, an hr lady and her manager detailing the abuse and who the abusers were. 

a few days ago, the hr woman called my sister and yelled at her that she did not report the abuse the correct way. the woman claimed that my sister was supposed to call and not send an email. she had been threatening to take my sisters license away. they have now scheduled a mandatory meeting for every nurse to attend on how to properly report abuse. she also threatened to report my sister to the board and get her license taken away if she does not attend the class. 

my sister is perfectly fine with taking the class but she is worried she didn't report correctly. she is also very worried that she will get her license taken away. is the hr lady right? and can she take my sisters license away? 

any advice is appreciated, thank you!

edit: so, i have some more information that may need to be given. my sister works 2 pm-10 pm. she came in to work at 2 and heard that the overnight nurses aide (who we will call barb) left the patients soaking in their pee and did not take care of them. it wasn't until the end of her shift at around 10:00 that she found out more specifics. that same day before my sister left she sent the email to hr, the director and her manager. when the hr lady called her and said she would take away the license she also said that it was my sisters job to investigate. she also said my sister should've put the information into her progress notes instead and not sent that email to the people she sent it to.

the information was also sent through her work email. that email cannot be accessed outside of work.",2
"houseguest had a deadbolt installed after being reminded that he'll have to leave soon. questions about the situation in general but specifically the locksmith's liability here. (ny state). to be clear, this is **not** new york city.

tl;dr: wife and i let an old friend of hers who is going through a hard time stay with us for a while. when reminded that he'll have to move on soon, he made a pass at my wife and flipped out on her when she declined his advances. he then had a locksmith install a deadbolt on the door, despite not presenting them with a lease or deed to show that he has a right to get locks installed. now what? questions at the bottom.

a childhood friend of my wife's (call him pete) moved back to the area after the death of a parent and losing his job. we offered to let him crash in our spare bedroom for a month or so while he gets things figured out. pete moved in on 3/28, and we had him sign something that said that he'd split on 6/30 whether he had his shit sorted or not. this was partially to put a hard limit on the amount of time he'd be living with us, but primarily because my brother is going to spend about six weeks in town for work starting in mid-july, and will be staying with us. pete didn't seem to be in much of a rush to find a new job, let alone find his own place, but he's in a bit of a funk due to the whole situation so we'd been giving him the benefit of the doubt. on 6/1, my wife reminded pete of the fact that he had to go at the end of the month, he said not to worry and that he'd definitely have something figured it out by then.

she gave him the same reminder this wednesday (6/12).  i'll spare you the details, but this time pete countered by confessing that he'd always been in love with her, and that she should leave me and *i* could find a new place while they stay in the apartment (which is sort of funny because while i consider this to be her apartment as much as mine, i purchased it before we met and her name isn't on anything). anyway, she obviously shut this down immediately, and pete did not respond well. at all. no violence but a ton of shouting, insulting and attempting to guilt trip. it was intense enough that my wife just cut out to her mother's place, where she called me to fill me in on the situation. i went home from work and told pete that we'd stick to the agreement despite his behavior, but the sooner he was out, the better. i spoke to my wife later that evening and we decided till pete fucks off, she'll stay in an investment property of mine that is luckily vacant right now, but i'd start working remotely and stay at the apartment more or less 24/7, both to make sure pete doesn't do anything stupid and because my presence in the living room would hopefully be more than a little awkward for him.

so this morning around 6:00 i left to run to the office to grab some stuff i'll need while working from home. i got back to the apartment about half an hour ago, and as i stepped out of the elevator i saw a guy with a toolbox leaving my apartment and immediately noticed that a new deadbolt had been installed in the door. i tried to explain the situation to the locksmith but he basically told me that the lock's already in and he gave the only key to the guy in the apartment, so it's between the two of us now. lovely. i asked him for a card and he said he didn't have any, so i asked where he works. he told me that it isn't any of my business and reiterated that this is between me and pete. i followed him downstairs and luckily he was in a van that had a sticker with the company's name and info on the side. i called the number, asked to speak to the boss and told him what had happened. he more or less did his best to not answer any of my questions - ""i'm sorry but i don't have to inform you of our policies."" fun.

so this is where i am at now. i called the police just to get a report filed, but i am 100% sure that when the officers show up they're going to tell me that it's a civil issue. i'm not expecting them any time soon, as this is a pretty small potatoes deal in the city where the whole thing is taking place. i was actually all set to offer pete a cash for keys deal if he wasn't getting his shit in gear by 6/23, but i have a feeling that i am going to have to evict now.  i own a few investment properties and have gone through the eviction process before, so i know that will not be a fun process given how tenant friendly my state is, but it is what it is. we've got that vacant rental property to stay in while everything gets sorted out, so that's covered as well. my only questions now are about who i can go after for what.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

on that note, here are my questions:

i am going to lose money on the rental that my wife and i will be staying in while the eviction gets handled. in fact i've already done so, as i had just started advertising it and will now have to pull the listing on a few sites/drop a ""sorry but"" on anyone who responds to print ads i placed. is this something i can sue for? in my mind i'd name both pete and the locksmith company in a suit and let the judge decide who owes me what, but since i am making the decision for us to occupy the space, do i technically have damages?

when i got a deadbolt installed at my old rental, i had to show the locksmith a copy of my lease before they'd even touch the door. was that just a company policy they were following or is that mandated by law? if the latter, is there anything i can go after them for? i don't care if it's trying to get criminal charges pressed or just going the civil route - i am not hurting for money so frankly if i were to sue it would be more about taking the pound of flesh that i feel i am entitled to after they locked me out of my own home, but i'd be just as happy seeing the pound of flesh extracted in a manner that does not end with me in possession of it.

anything else that i should be thinking about in this situation? i am planning on asking the police to do a civil standby or whatever it's called so i can get a few important things out of the apartment. i am a little flustered and pissed off right now to say the least, so i just want to make sure that there isn't anything i should be considering beyond that.

thanks in advance, and the cops are actually pulling up now so i might have an update shortly.

edit 1: just heard from the owner of the locksmith, who sounded about as pissed off as i am. he's sending a guy over with a new deadbolt and a few extra keys. apparently he's already arranged for his dude to show up with some cops in case pete is not a fan of the lock being changed. bonus: in explaining that part to me, i got to hear somebody say ""i know a guy who knows a guy"" in real life, and now i want to hang out with this dude.

edit 2: mil took the wife out to get her mind off of this stuff, but she is now being returned to me so i am gonna stop staring at the internet. the locksmith will be here around 8pm, and pete's brother is going to swing through around the same time to see if he can talk some sense into him. thanks for all of the advice and well wishes, i'll try to update again tonight if anything interesting happens but at this point it will more likely be tomorrow/sunday.",2
"tips from a first time home owner 1 year in. it seems there's a post about home ownership at least once a week. i thought i'd share my learnings one year after buying my first home.

1. be clear about why you're buying a home. every large decision you have to make about home ownership should somewhat tie in to this. i can't stress this enough. make sure the reason makes sense to you after you and your so (if applicable) sleep over it a few times. don't get in to home ownership because your friends or colleagues are telling you how much they love owning their home. it might not be the same for you. again, be clear. i'd say literally write it down.

2. if you're buying a home together with your so (i'd imagine most might), sit separately with different pieces of paper and write down what each of you wants in your home. be realistic. indicate what you're ok with compromising on and what is absolutely a must have (or must not have). don't talk to each other while doing this. once you're satisfied with the list, tally what you have and combine what you want, don't want, what's a must have and what you can compromise on. be realistic.

3. use one of the online tools to calculate ""how much house can i afford"". don't spend more than 30-40% of your annual income on home ownership - this includes your mortgage, insurance, property tax etc. i'd say stick to 30% or less. edit: 30% of take home pay is what my max was. i ended up buying lower than that. your scenario may be different. the col in your area will probably affect this number.

4. look at houses based on the life style you have not the life style you aspire to have. for example we looked at houses with smaller yards or yards without large lawns. reason: our lifestyle and gardening aren't compatible. we'd have loved a large green lawn but realistically we'd never maintain it and probably wouldn't spend on a gardener. that's just one example. don't dream of building a home theater in the basement if you're the outgoing type.

5. ""buy the biggest house you can afford"" is horrible horrible advice. this was given to me by most people around me. it sounded bad then and after a year in, it sounds just horrible. buy the house that you need today with _some_ consideration for tomorrow's needs. tomorrow's needs is something along the lines of growing family not anticipating profits from business or promotions. the advice given on this sub holds true here too - buy below your means.

6. avoid borrowing money from friends or family in order to afford a bigger home. this is kind of an off shoot of the point above. both points will just lead to additional stress that you don't need. this is true even if they're willingly offering you money without you asking.

7. really look in to total cost of home ownership. if you're looking in to a fixer upper things can get very tricky. i'd recommend not going for a fixer upper for a first time home owner. i bought a relatively new home but the cost of minor fixes baffled me. i'm very very happy to not have bought a home that needed repairs. i'd have underestimated the cost even if someone would have given me quotes for the repairs. things like regulations change. a minor change might end up with large expenses to keep up with code. i learned this the hard way when i wanted to get an additional power outlet. :\

8. drive around the neighborhoods that you're interested in. get a feel of the place. chat with people who're out for walks or something and see what they think. this might lead to interesting results. when i did this, people thought i was selling something so their immediate reaction to my ""hi"" was ""i'm good. thanks."". :|

9. a home purchase is often a process of elimination. start with all homes that match your criteria. filter based on cost, then filter based on neighborhood, then filter based on square footage, school districts etc. keep going until you're left with a few homes that you'll go look at.

10. your agent facilitates the transaction. if you don't know what you want and haven't communicated with them very clearly, they may influence your decision. if you feel your agent is pressing you into making decisions - run. better than having buyers remorse after having gotten in large debt.

11. feel free to use your agent to do the ground work. i gave my agent a list of questions to go figure out for the houses/neighborhood/hoas etc that i was interested in. you're paying your agent a good sum of money. get your money's worth. don't shy away from asking questions. (your agent might tell you that you won't pay him. that's partly true. you won't pay them directly - the seller usually accounts for this and prices the home accordingly. so in a way, you are paying him.)

12. it's in your best interest to not have the same agent as the seller. 

13. don't skimp out on the essentials - for example home inspection. it may be expensive to do but it's better than being stuck with a flawed house. edit: /u/surewtever: consider getting a radon inspection (quick google tells me there are diy kits that are available).

14. protect your investment - get good insurance. make sure you're aware of what's covered and what's not. change the locks before you move in. change the lock on the mailbox. invest in a home security system if your neighborhood warrants it. consider cameras at the very least. 

15. find out how the hoa is if it exists. i've heard horror stories from colleagues. a couple of them have sold their condos because of the stress it caused them.

16. consider your mortgage options. depending on how long you plan to live in your home, arm might be a good option. 

17. after you buy your home, don't feel compelled to set it up immediately. that means it's ok to use the current furniture you have. it's ok to not have a proper bed. (we're still using a box + mattress combo - no frame or headboard). it's ok if one or more of your rooms look spartan for a year or two. 


that's all i can think of now. i'll add more if i think of something. good luck!

edit:
thanks for the gold.

some thoughts on comments:

**take 'home advice' (including mine) as just that - advice. surely give it thought, but you know your scenario better than anyone else does. some of the above points might not fit your needs. imho, it's better to be aware of a line of thought and reject it than to be ignorant of it and end up in a stressful situation.**

""look at houses based on the life style you have not the life style you aspire to have""
someone used an example of aspiring to have a garage to work on cars. the way i look at that is that working on cars is already your thing. you're not kidding yourself in to doing something you've never done before or are not currently passionate about. a person like me buying a large garage because ""i'd like to get in to working on cars"" when i currently don't know anything about the trade would be a terrible mistake.

""buy the house that you need today with _some_ consideration for tomorrow's needs""
this should speak for itself. the suggestion is to consider tomorrow's needs but don't get carried away. you're not going to need a 4 car garage because you might make more money and might buy 4 cars.

re: these points are conservative. yes, they are. purchasing for a lot of people is often emotional. starting conservative for a first time home owner is not a bad idea. ""you don't know what you don't know."". next time around at least you'll know what you don't know and can plan somewhat better.",10
"if i said no to my own wedding?. long story short, my partner and i decided to have a simple courthouse wedding and just spend a simple day together. nothing set in stone but we had general ideas for activities. everything seemed in order.


my mother seemed fine with it at first and kept telling us that we should do what we want and that she didn't care. after some time passed, she told us the wedding officiant wanted to speak with us.  basically, she planned an entire wedding for us and invited both of our close families (about 20 people). she did plan this with me in mind and kept the whole thing small and simple for a wedding so nothing too outlandish. i get the impression that she did this mostly for her parents/my grandparents. she's also covering all the costs.

if i said no even though she already paid some deposits and invited so many people? i feel like i'm being ungrateful and we should just suck it up and go through the whole thing for family, but at the same time. we wanted this to be a day for us and we feel like we don't have any control over our own wedding. i also feel that i'm being guilted into this. my partner is being painfully supportive. if they wanted it, i would go through with it no questions asked and told them as much. but they're saying it's my decision.",3

"by not telling my company i'm color blind.. obligatory this did not happen today. i have protanopia, the color red is non-existent to me, as well as most of the green spectrum, with a considerable part of the blue spectrum classified as ""muddied""

back in 2006 i took a job outside of my chosen field, working in the transportation department, doing cargo shipping and receiving, i had been working on the software side of the industry and after being laid off, i called in a favor and started in the physical side of things.

started out in an air cargo company, small outfit, less then 10 people, domestic and international cargo transport, i know the vernacular, i know how this works and i've got the talent to make things happen.

i realize that i excel at the whole negotiation process in terms of cost for cargo and things are going smoothly,

one day, i'm tasked to do some work in the records room, sorting and filing waybills, i'm given the instructions,

""international shipments go into these folders"" points to stack of boxes with open box of folders on the top ""domestic shipments go into these folders points to different stack

put waybills into folders, label with first name of supplier and store in drawer

i bang it out, i'm on fire, i blitz through the back log and i get through 6 months of backlog in a day and a half.

the fuck up?

folders were red, and tan,

i saw no difference, no one said any difference and the boxes under the open ones were mixed up,

cue 4 months later, we are doing an audit and one of the files is noted to be in the wrong folder, then another, then another.

the company is in panic mode, because now their system cannot be trusted, so if they get an investigative hold, they might miss the paperwork etc etc.

a memo comes out, and the whole company comes in over the weekend to basically re-sort the last 2 years worth of cargo waybills, we all sit down, grab boxes and start sorting, and that's when i realize that this is all my fault.

so i'm sitting there, holding up 2 folders, trying to tell them apart when the owner asks me ""what the f$#% are you doing?""

and i tell him that i'm color blind, that these look exactly the same, and that i'm pretty sure i screwed everyone's weekend up.

i wish i could say a good laugh was had, but no, it was not, they were angry that i didn't bring it up before, it's not something that really effects life so i tend to not think about it, but in this case, yeah, totally my bad.

probably cost the company a good chunk of cash, everyone most of the weekend.

when i was laid off a few months later, i really wasn't surprised.

tl;dr: mixed up domestic and international waybills because i never mentioned being colorblind causing overtime expenses to fix my mistake. 

**edit** - as been stated, i was not fired for the mix up, the economy was tanking and the company went from moving 20+ shipments a day to maybe 3, the writing was on the wall. ",4
"for blowing up at my husband's brother for how he declined donating sperm to us?. **i want to make it very clear that this isn't about him saying no, it's about how he declined. if he'd just said no, this wouldn't be a conversation.**

my husband and i have been trying for kids for a while. he, as it turns out, has azoospermia, which is no sperm. we've been taking about donors, and he's only comfortable with it if it comes from his brother. adoption isn't something we could possibly afford right now, and i don't love the idea of a 3rd party getting to call all the shots about us having children. eric has donated before in college and currently has a son with a girlfriend. he's a little smarmy and self important, but not a bad person. so we asked him, and now i have regrets. 

he sent a very detailed email in which he went into excruciating detail of all the reasons he felt we wouldn't be good parents, and what we'd ""need to change"" before he would ""give us"" a child. at the risk of making this post as long as the email itself, there were two main points. 

1. he didn't feel that our income was high enough. he demanded to see financial records. he wanted to see his brother more advanced/settled in a career, and wanted to know my career trajectory as well. both of us have been in the same companies for 5+ years, and don't have dead end jobs. he also wanted us in a house and not an apartment.

"by accidentally training myself to wake up to birdsong. so a month or two ago i bought this fancy alarm clock/lamp. you set the time you want to get up, and half an hour before then it slowly starts to light up (simulates sunrise. it's nice). in the last few minutes before the set time, it also starts to play birdsong. quietly at first, then louder, and that's what wakes you up.

well i've been waking up over an hour early for the last few days. i couldn't figure it out at first, but this morning i heard it: *very faint* birdsong from somewhere outside. it isn't even close. now i'm running on 4.5 hours (instead of my usual 8-9,  and yes i know) during dead week with a truly *stupid* amount of work/studying to do. and i can't even complain because waking up earlier was the whole point when i bought the damn thing.

tl;dr: bought an alarm clock that plays birdsong. now, three days before my finals, i'm waking up at the crack of dawn (losing sleep) to actual birdsong.

"i lied to my mom. i was supposed to meet a friend at starbucks and my mom let me borrow her car to go. i went about 30 minutes early to do some homework, at the time my friend and i agreed on, they cancelled. i was upset, hurt, and for some reason embarrassed, i decided to stay for an hour and just continued my homework. 

this is the sad part and where the lie comes in. i don't have many friends, nor do i hang out with friends much so my mom was glad to see me go out. when i got home she asked if i had fun, and as i said before, i was embarrassed and hurt, so i lied and said ""yeah it was fun"" in an exciting tone not knowing how she'd react to the truth. i feel awful lying to her as she just wants me to be happy. i'm so embarrassed and ashamed. i hope in a few years i can tell her the truth and we can laugh about it.

"by taking my wife up the world's steepest street.... my wife and i were having a holiday in new zealand's south island, and visited dunedin. i've been there a number of times and casually asked my wife: 

""have you ever been to the world's steepest street?""

""no."" says she

""would you be interested in having a look?"" says i

""i dunno"" says she, in the often used tone of a woman that clearly means no, but with words softer than a blunt refusal.

being the loving husband i am, knowing full well how much she hates heights, i take her words as enthusiastic consent. she gave in and decided to give it a try.

baldwin street in dunedin is very steep(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baldwin_street). it doesn't look like it's too bad when your facing it, but as soon as you drive up it (or walk, if you're particularly adventurous), it quickly becomes quite intimidating. some facts: they couldn't use ordinary roading materials because of how steep it is, and the footpath/sidewalk is one very long staircase - it's too dangerous to have it flat.

my wife quickly started to panic - but it was the sort of mid-level panic that me, as her husband, finds deeply amusing.

anyway, we got to the top, and found a driveway to turn into so we could make the return journey facing down. i suggested reversing down and got punched.

well, the mid-level panic quickly turned into full blown ""i hate you"" panic as the car lurched to the side as we turned to face the decent. the car was then pointing down at such an angle that you felt like it was impossible for the brakes to hold and that the car would simply fall uncontrollably. she had to cling onto the dashboard and everything else within reach to remain in her seat and she didn't trust her seat belt alone. 

we drove slowly down the street:

""too fast""

""too fast""

\*we came to a stop\*

""too fast""

her eyes were clamped shut in such a way that i was expecting a wonderful velcro-like tearing noise when she finally opened them.

after 17 lunar months the road leveled out and we parked up. my wife was hyperventilating and punching me at the same time. it took her quite a while to calm down.

after a few minutes i said ""well that was fun, want to go again"".

i slept in the car that night.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - took wife up the world's steepest street, she had a panic attack and i became a victim of a woman's scorn. 

edit: no, i didn't actually sleep in the car. wife doesn't have anxiety issues. she later agreed that her reaction was funny and that she would have done the same to me had the situation arisen. our marriage is such that we do things like this to each other and get a laugh out of each other's reactions. i know where the line is for her and she with me. please calm down with the psychoanalysing.",4

"by eating rocks in front of my girlfriend. 
i bought some realistic looking candy rocks while traveling. i specifically got them with the purpose of picking them up off the ground in front of people and eating them. simple and dumb prank. essentially, i managed to pull that prank twice on my girlfriend over a few weeks, and i knew she would not fall for it a third time. little did she know, there was a final stage to this prank.
both times that i revealed that i was actually eating candy, she asked for one because she likes candy. i would never waste this prank material on just eating, so i haven't given her any chocolate rocks.  (dont worry i share other things)
for the final stage, i picked up a random looking rock on the ground, made the curious face that i had for the two times before, and slowly brought the rock to my mouth. exactly as i planned, she snatched the rock out of my hand and put it into her mouth. however, i did not plan for her to confidently bite into it and break a molar tooth.

"by going permanently deaf after intense sit ups. i was on my last exercise, which was just your regular old sit up. i get to the point where i can barely finish a full sit up, pushing myself hard to finish the last few, when i feel a pop in my left ear. my ear starts ringing. nothing else was wrong with me though, so i shrugged it off, quit my workout, and went to sleep about an hour later.

it's 6 am when i wake up. i look at the time, but i notice everything around me seems to be spinning. i also realize the sound of every movement i make only seems to reach my right ear. something was definitely wrong, and i immediately remembered the pop in my ear the night before. at this point i'm not *that* worried yet.

but i start googling my symptoms, as you do. i usually don't get too affected by all these ""*you have cancer*"" or ""*you're going to die!*"" diagnoses you always find, but this time it struck me that everything definitely pointed to a serious issue: a fractured round or oval window. this can cause serious hearing loss. by now, i also found out that every movement i make causes intense vertigo and nausea. this is the point i start panicking a bit.

after a visit to the doctor, a nice morning of throwing up from nausea, and then a hospital visit, i'm told that it is probably exactly what i thought. apparently it is extremely rare, but this can happen during a workout. i'm given steroids for a higher chance of recovery and get sent home. two days later i get a call from the doctor, asking if i can have surgery the next day. she explained it didn't feel right to her and she wanted to diagnose the problem and possibly fix it as soon as possible.

i had the surgery, and everything seemed healthy. she explained that this meant it was likely indeed a fracture in the oval window. fractures can be so small, it's possible you will never locate them. during surgery, she something to the oval window to increase the likelyhood of recovery, but that's all she could do.

now, after more than a month of recovering from the vertigo i can do basically everything i used to be able to. hearing in my left ear is gone. i've been told that it's very unlikely to recover. my balance is still somewhat off but i've been told i'll get used to that. i'm already mostly used to it. hearing with just one ear has many downsides, and don't get me wrong it fucking sucks, but i've learned to live with it already. well, other than the fact that i am now somewhat terrified of the thought of this happening to my right ear as well.

now what irrationally stings the most about this whole ordeal. i'm a big linkin park fan. i had even pre-ordered the collector's edition of their last album. this story happened the day before the linkin park concert in amsterdam that i had tickets to. i obviously couldn't go. it's a selfish thought, but it really fucking stings now that i know it was the last opportunity to see them live.

**tl;dr
i was working out using bad form and breathing techniques, feel a pop in my left ear, wake up deaf the next morning with extreme vertigo. had surgery and medicine, but to no avail. am deaf in my left ear now.**

edit: wording and spelling

edit 2: some people asking what the was... i mean i literally did sit ups so hard and with wrong breathing techniques  that i put too much pressure on my head and ripped a vital part of my left ear. i think that counts, even if some bad luck is required as well.

***edit 3 (now bolded because this is important): to those saying ""another reason not to work out"" and actually mean it: i was incredibly dumb. please remember that. i held my breath, which is dumb. i kept going when my body barely could, which is dumb. i strained all my muscles to get those last few sit ups out, which is dumb. etc. working out doesn't cause this. being a dumb fuck who doesn't know what he's doing causes this.***

"my wife and i were involved in a fatality car accident with a minor at fault. who is responsible?. on sunday night we were the third car involved in a head-on collision for a vehicle traveling the wrong way down the road. i won't get into the details too much, but there were 3 individuals in the at fault vehicle that appeared to be traveling 10-20mph over the speed limit (40mph). they ended up crossing over the centerline and getting stuck on that side by a small median. the vehicle looked like it made an attempt to jump the median by swerving back towards it when it impacted an oncoming vehicle at which point it did jump the median and both vehicles collided with us.

the driver and one passenger fled the scene on foot, but were caught on wednesday night. unfortunately for the third passenger, they left her in the car and it caught fire in 2-3 minutes after the accident. she died of smoke inhalation.

to our knowledge and what has been reported it sounds like all 3 passengers were minors. the only reported age was under 15 so it's hard to say whether or not they had a permit or license. my guess is no because if you've driven the area where this occurred you'd know there are medians on and off along that stretch of road.

we went to the hospital to get checked out as well as the two other passengers who weren't at fault and in much worse condition. our insurance is taking care of things right now, but will our premium go up if they didn't have insurance? will their parents insurance cover it? if it's a stolen vehicle will the vehicle owner's insurance cover it? what would happen if they weren't caught?",2

"by walking with my hands in my pockets.. this didn't actually happen today, it happened very early yesterday morning. so, i had gone to a friend's house a few blocks away to hang out. because they live so close, i walked over & planned on walking home. 

when my friend got tired, i packed up my backpack, put on my jacket and headed home. i was walking with my hands in my pockets because it was cold out. at the end of the block, i stepped off the curb to cross the street, and the next thing i remember is spitting out a mouthful blood & pieces of tooth. 

i had slipped on ice and, because my hands were in my pockets, i couldn't break my fall. i blacked out momentarily when i hit the ground, but i assume i landed on my face. my teeth punched a hole through my lip, and shards of tooth got stuck inside. 

several hours in the er later, i was patched up with 10 stitches (5 inside my mouth, 5 outside). they couldn't do anything about the tooth, other than put a protective layer on the broken surface. (it will have to be fixed this week when a dentist can see me.)

"porn has ruined an entire generation's sexuality and needs to be prohibited. i really feel that porn has irrevocably ruined an entire generation's sexuality, especially young men under 30. 30 years prior, porn was pictures of women lightly clothed in playboy magazines. porn today?

it's all about

- choking women

- ramming a dick into women's vaginas as hard as possible

- dominating women and giving a false impression of women wanting to be dominated and submissive all the time

- promotion of incest porn and violent porn

- promotion of ""girl and daddy"" porn that freakishly resemble sexual acts between under age women and older men

- women being covered in jizz, now seen as a ""normal"" sex act and something women should be tolerant of or they're seen as prudes

- men believing anal sex is to be expected and women who don't conform to it are prudes

- women having their vaginal lips surgically removed and somehow seen as the ""the normal"" vagina to the extent that more and more young women go through with such surgery

- women having their vaginas totally shaven, a new concept that has impacted how men and women view female sexuality

- porn upholds the misogynist thought that women exist only to pleasure men, and that their sexuality and pleasure don't matter

- porn upholds the misogynist thought that all women find sexual acts common in porn as something enjoyable, which makes men believe they don't have to ask or be informed about what women find arousing and pleasurable


and so much more. honestly porn is one of the great public health crisis of our time and needs to be treated at such. if you enter pornhub or any random pornsite, it's flooded by extreme porn like incestporn or violent porn that includes some kind of slapping, beating, choking of women and people act surprised that men think this is what all women wants in reality. 

since parents don't want to talk to their children about how harmful porn is (most find it embarrassing), this cannot be resolved with education. many parents are ignorant of how huge the problem is and some don't want to adress it. the porn crisis can only be solved by prohibiting it, and minimizing it's influence on young men and women.

this thread will now be downvoted or flooded with men who can't accept the realities of porn and how harmful it is to society because they've been brainwashed by all the porn they've been viewing daily since they were 10. they don't care about the well being of women, what matters is getting of and getting of is more important than prohibiting harmful stereotypes that upholds institutional misogyny in society.

edit: just to clarify. i'm not a prude or sex negative. people are free to do engage in whatever consensual sex act they find pleasurable. i'm critical of the normalisation of extreme porn. some women do enjoy having their vaginas rammed, jizz in their face, being submissive etc. notice ""some women"". todays porn gives out the message that all women like these acts and that all women should be treated like this by default. young people aren't emotionally and neurologically developed to understand the nuances of sexuality, which todays porn is missrepresenting.

"my brother (15m) has been lying about my (25m) life to my conservative, estranged parents, made fake instagram, help. ok i'll try to make this quick but there's a lot and i'm freaking the fuck out.

i grew up a jehovah's witness. if you don't know, jw are extremely conservative to an insane degree--i wasn't allowed to read harry potter, if that makes sense. and my parents were not lax or exceptions-for-my-children type. extremely devout people. and i'm gay.

when i was sixteen i was outted horribly by my sister who found some gay porn that i didn't delete from my computer history. my family, of course, flipped out and demanded i either seek conversion therapy or get out. luckily for me, my aunt had also defected from the church, so i was able to move in with her (far away).

my parents and sister immediately wanted nothing to do with me. but my brother was six. he was too young to really grasp what was going on, and had no phone or social media or anything, so i couldn't contact him. i honestly just assumed he drank the same end-is-nigh kool-aid and never sought him out.

earlier this year, i got a message from him on facebook. it was a gigantic apology for not saying goodbye properly, and that he really wanted me back in his life. clicking through his profile, i didn't see any jw proselytizing like my sister's--just pics of him and his friends being normal teens. i was beyond happy. i messaged him back, we facetimed, cried, he caught me up a little in his life and i caught him up a little in mine. and from there we started texting regularly. i am very, very happy about all this. but he was still living under my parents' roof, and was still heavy in jw culture. i was nervous about this. he always reaffirmed that he only called/texted when he wasn't in the house (or around other jw), and reaffirmed that he thought the church was awful.

last week something weird happened. i got an e-mail from my mother. it was a picture from a recent dells trip she had taken with my family and another jw family. years of no contact, then this. what the fuck? i spent days talking this out with my friends before it occurred to me that my brother might have something to do with this.

i brought up the e-mail to my brother when i called him yesterday, barely hinting at my suspicions at all, and he unloaded. he had been lying to my parents. he said that *i* contacted *him* apologizing and was desperate to get back in contact with the witnesses again, but was too ashamed. but the kicker is he made a fake instagram to show them. he plucked all the g-rated pictures from my various social medias and filled it in with captions about how devout i am, how happy i am to have refound god's light, etc. he had taken pictures of me and my best friend, julie, and added captions like ""the love of my life"", ""my bride-to-be"" etc. like holy shit. he seemed already remorseful of this ploy but that he was in too deep to stop now.

now, he didn't say as much, but the obvious implication here is that he thought he could get my family back together. but this isn't a fucking sitcom or *the birdcage*, he's catfishing his very emotionally unstable and religious zealot parents into thinking their faggot outcast son was reconverting. i have no intentions of being in their life ever again, but i'd like to remain in my brother's life, and i don't want this incident to scare him off or sever the small bits of contact we have now.

so what do i do? i will not be contacting my parents, nor will i pretend to be straight. obviously i need to tell him to close the account and stop talking about me to them, but what else if anything?

**tl;dr: i'm gay, religious parents kicked me out, little brother made a fake insta to convince them that i'm not gay anymore. i do not know how to stop this.**",7
"with the help of pf, i've gone from $0/month in side money to $964/month. thank you for advice!. about a month ago i posted here asking for help with ideas on how to earn $10,000 in side money within a year's time (https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4460m6/i_want_to_save_up_10000_in_one_year_my_95_only/). i never thought it'd be possible, but i figured if people had ideas on how $10,000/yr might be possible, then earning a quarter of that, or even a third might be realistic. among the many helpful posts, someone recommended looking into online freelance job sites and recommended a particular one for web development. i created an account and spent 3 hours setting up my profile because i decided that if i was going to do this i 'm going to do it all the way and give it everything i've got. fast-forward 1 month and i've earned $964 after fees with more on the way! it has absolutely transformed my life. i've been able to convert what was utterly unproductive time (9:00pm - midnight) into real earnings and learn a ton along the way.

i wanted to make a new topic on *probably* the final update to my situation because the old one was getting a little messy.

&#x200b;

first off, i wanted to again thank those that took the time to share their own personal stories, and those that offered suggestions on things i could talk about with her, or things we could do as a couple to get passed this. there were **a lot** of comments, and i read as many as i could. in a sea of hate, there are good people out there. i appreciate you folks.

&#x200b;

she got home from work last night, i made dinner, and we sat down together to eat. it has now been four days since my last shave. which would be considered ""too fucking scruffy"" in my household. we talked about her day at work, then there was a pause after the subject. *""you're really fucking scruffy""* right now she tells me. but she said it in a slightly comical manner rather than her usual dead serious tone. a hybrid between the two. oh, the moment i have been waiting for since i shared my experience with all you fine folks i thought to myself. *""yeah. i know. but, i wanted to make a little deal with you this time and from now on. i'll shave. when you do.""* all while staring at her chin whiskers that were still clearly there. she stayed dead silent for awhile playing with the last of her food. *""fine.""* she eventually replies. after dinner, she went to the bathroom, pulled out her handheld hair puller thing and cleaned herself up. she comes into the bedroom afterwards, looks at me and says *""happy? now it's your turn.""* so i did. and we all lived happily ever after. so far.

&#x200b;

rather anticlimactic, i know, and i'm sorry if you were expecting more fireworks. but, i'm happy with the end result. many redditors expressed ***""you're a fucking man! not a child! grow some balls and grow a beard if you want to grow a beard! man up!""*** you're not wrong, you're just an asshole. lol. when we agreed to marry each other, we very well knew each others flaws, and we also agreed to make sacrifices for one another. if all i have to do is sacrifice the viking beard i have dreamed of to keep her happy, then so be it. as long as she is sacrificing her sensei whiskers for me.",7
"audio-recorded our daycare provider, found my son was strapped into his car seat the entire day.. this is in ca for legal purposes. i'll just get straight to it. back in nov 2017, my wife and i were looking for a daycare place for our (then) 4 months old son. we found this order lady who said she'd been doing this for awhile, and had since scaled back in recent years. she only took on infants, and only about 4 at a time. she was close by, had a playroom for the kids, a binder detailing their typical day, and a checklist of the items she needed daily from us (food, diapers, etc). all seemed well.

skip to now, and for little reasons here and there, my wife and i had a conversation that something felt off about her. for peace of mind, we put an audio-recording device in his car-seat. we listened to it last night and, to say the least, not all is well.

from what we can gather, she leaves our son in his car seat all day long, only taking him out once to change him when he pooped. after dropping him off, he cried for maybe 30min straight, then just seemed to give up. for the next five or six hours, you just hear him blathering, or whimpering, or scratching the car seat. sometimes he cries, until he gives up. it was difficult to listen to. in the background, you never hear her, just the tv and occasionally another baby crying.

obviously, he's not back there today, nor will he be returning. we made up some excuse, telling her i'd be staying home with him all this week. we don't want to tip her off just yet, because there are other kids in her care. my question is, what can or should we do about her? who do we report her to?",2

i've always known eating out was killing me physically. now that i know that it's killing me fiscally its been eating at my mind killing me mentally.

i'm at a loss on what to do to kill this habit and stop spending money. i need to get rid of that debt before something bad happens.

update/edit:

i've gotten a ton of really good recommendations from you all and i genuinely appreciate the support, kind words, and advise given. 

i've installed mint and have set a budget for $100 for eating out for the month.
i will be going to the grocery store tonight to pick up:
* x1 gallon of milk
* x1 box of raisin bran crunch
* x1 carton of eggs
* x1 package of cheese sticks
* x1 5 piece package of chicken breasts
* x5 packages of various veggies
* x2 packages of salad mix
* x1 form of beef like thing

i'll post an update in a week or so to let you know how it went. with any luck i'll save some money and maybe drop some of those fast-food-pounds.

"by scratching my balls. im typing on a tablet with abysmal auto correct, so please excuse any mistakes i might make.

this happened 14-15 years ago. 

my friend was parked outside of a 24 hour convenience store. someone tried to rob him by pepperspraying through the open window into the car. luckily he got away. 

i was out driving around that night and he called me and asked if i could drive that car to the hospital for them. i drove to where they were, let another friend drive my car, and i drove his to the hospital.

i parked and walked to the entrance. i decided to have a cigarette before going into the hospital to wait for my friend who had been peppersprayed. i sat down on a bench and got comfy while i enjoyed my smoke. 

now this is where it starts to go wrong. in all the commotion, i didn't have the presence of mind to realize that the interior of my friends car was covered in pepper spray.... it was.

i scratched my balls through my jeans. a good thorough scratch.

i guess i had pepperspray on my hand, because about 5 minutes later my balls were on fucking fire. not like hmm, this is discomforting, but like, my balls are going to burn up and fall off my body if i dont do something about this right now. so i ran to the wash room, pulled my balls out, put them in the hand sink and vigoursly washed them with ice cold water. it only made it worse.

i decided a shower would be in my best interest at this time. my friend that got peppersprayed lived really close and was kind enough to let me use his shower. i raced over there. this time in my car, which wasn't glazed with pepperspray. anyway.... i get to his house, run upsairs to the second level, and get in the bathroom. the shower had a flimsy curtain and a detachable showerhead. i disrobed and got in the shower. it took about 10 minutes of lathering my balls with soap and holding the showerhead on my balls for the pain to subside a bit.

in my infinite wisdom, i thought i might as well have a full shower and get everything cleaned. i start with my face. i soap it up, rinse it off, and then use my hands to squeege off the water on my closed eyelids.....

thats when my eyes caught fire.

i dropped the showerhead. the thing shot off and was spraying the entire bathroom. i couldn't see it because i had just been blinded. it took me a while to reign that damn showerhead in. i managed to get my eyes to a point where i could see and wasnt in excrutiating pain. 

this is when i noticed i had flooded the bathroom. it took me a considerable amount if time to get it all dry.

what an ordeal.

"ex (f19) used me (f19) for sex while she was with her boyfriend (m20). i slept with him for revenge.. because this is a throwaway account, might as well say it.
i'm bisexual and i had a gf named katheryn. anyway i was deeply in love with her but she ended things with me which i mean it happens. anyway, fast forward months, she led me on and kept telling me she loved me. we had sex various times. it always ended with the ""i regret this i gotta go"" line. i loved her insanely at the times so i never did anything about it. eventually she got on my last nerves but i did sleep with her again. she had a boyfriend named dominic. i was more into girls at the time but i wanted revenge. i hit dominic up and tried my best to seduce him. it worked perfectly fine. he did sleep with me and i took pictures of the entire thing. i sent them to my ex as a revenge plan to show her how hurt she made me feel. she ended up crying to him that why would he do that and her excuse was that im a girl and sleeping with another girl isn't cheating. he dumped her and she's been heartbroken since. she claimed she wanted to marry him and have kids with him. yeah by cheating on him, ok sweetheart. anyway, i had a blast enjoying the casual sex and getting revenge on this girl.

"by making a viral video that hit the top post on reddit for a while and then accidently removing it off of both, reddit and youtube because of my stupidity. (and not reading the rules). i made a video about me having a series of bad luck moments throughout the day (i really still think i'm cursed because the bad luck doesnt stop). surprisingly it got a huge reception and i was pretty pleased. 

i then got messaged by a lot of companies giving me offers on copyrighting the video so it doesnt get mass reproduced and that if it does, i'd get compensated instead of them making money off of me and giving me nothing. i was like, ""sure that doesnt sound too bad."" the problem was that because of my negligence and not knowing what i should/shouldn't be doing, i didnt realize that i was actually breaking rule #8 on r/videos where i can't get licensed for the video after it has been posted. so yes. obviously, my post got removed because of third party licensing. 

proof: http://imgur.com/gallery/1iiqdjb


but not to worry. i still had my youtube video. with a decent amount of views ~500k i still had a shot at fame. i thought i'd also make a follow-up update video for all the people who had asked if my luck had improved. so i made the follow up video. titled it the same as my viral video. noticed an editing error. wanted to take it off and upload a new one. deleted it. realized that i accidently deleted the original video. now all traces of my videos are removed and i now have 20 views on each video but hey, it was a wild journey (and a terrible fuckup) which i'll never forget. i like to think that the video going viral was an addition to the curse more than a blessing considering how i ruined everything and will always regret this moment for the rest of my life.  

tl;dr: made a viral video. got greedy and didnt read subreddit rules and got it removed. also removed it off of youtube by being stupid.

all of my friends are married and all but two of them have children. i've always wanted to get married and have kids but i thought it would just happen naturally. when i was in college i had no shortage of decent guys who were interested in me, but it turns out that college is a rather unique environment. i have focused on my career and my friends for a long time because i just didn't think it would be all that difficult to find someone. anyway, after i turned 30 i freaked out a little and started actually trying to find someone but i'm 34 now and i still haven't found anyone that i want to spend my life with. if i don't find someone soon i won't be able to have children. i hate being such a cliche but i can't help it.

"fired for being fat ct. **update below**

backstory: i am a woman in my mid 30s, and very overweight. not to the point of handicap, but i'm a big gal.

i work at a company with around 25 employees, and have been here for 8 years. recently, the business was sold to a larger corporation, who sent their own people in for management roles after laying off our entire management team, consisting of 4 people. i work with clients in the field, and have a good work record and my clients like me and i have built relationships with them.

turn to today:
i get called into the office of one of the new managers, who tells me my appearance isn't a good fit for a client facing role, and i can either take a pay cut and work in the call center, or take unpaid leave and come back after i've lost a ""considerable"" amount of weight. i was floored. i've never had a client have an issue with my weight (at least outwardly), and i'm good at my job. i meet all productivity goals and have never even received a write up in my 8 years. i pushed and asked him if there had been any complaints, to which he said no, but they want to head off any future issues which may arise. i said straight up ""so, you're punishing me cause i'm fat? are you also demoting (obese male coworker in same role as me)?"". he said no, and didn't answer when i asked why the situation was different. i left fuming and told him i was going home for the rest of the day to think about things.

can this really be legal? what recourse do i have?

"aita? rescued an abandoned (adolescent kitten) stray at our local spca, the previous owner contacted me on social media when they saw a post of my cat. they want her back, i'm not going to let that happen.. sorry if the title is off and for any mistakes here goes,

i visited the shelter because i was feeling low and cats are awesome so i thought i'd volunteer and maybe get some cat therapy.

so i went down with my bff and bf and we played with kittens and old cats (ps: favourite gala name was granny and she was so moody, i loved it). i saw my now cat zuzu, i didn't go up to her at first because i knew i'd fall in love with her. so my foresight didn't save me and i learnt she had been abandoned since late jan 2019. it was then may, so she had been there for +/-5 months. i spoke with the manager and he said he'd phone the owner and see if they'd get back to him and he told me to wait a week. so i did, i confirmed payment on her shots and snips and waited another 3 days for the owner to contact back. they never did. 

so it's now a about month in an i post a pic of her on social media, the owner is a distant acquaintance, a friend of a friend kind of thing. it's a small town. she sends me a direct message and claimed ownership. i explained the situation as well as the attempts at contact and she called bullshit. she never addressed the abandonment, and bowed when i firmly stated that the cat was now in my care and i would provide her with a lovely home. she hasn't responded yet and i did apologize to her in the messages. it's weird i know where she lives and works, it's one of the nice bars in town. she's a sweet person but,

i just feel bad. i understand cat love. i understand bonds, but how can you leave a kitten in a shelter for +/-5 months? how long is that even in cat time? 

i'm conflicted but feel like i'm doing the right thing. i thought very long about bringing a cat into my home and even got the support of my housemates and close friends. i gathered supplies and made what i couldn't afford. i love that fluffy stinkball, but how do i manage this relationship in a small town? do i ignore it? i just don't know how not to be the asshole here...

edit: 
abandoned as in at a shelter, not on the side of the road. left there after being put into boarding,

the local spca does have a boarding facility but on weekly fee basis. she (zuzu was left there for way over that time) and the owner was contacted before my attempts after filing for adoption.

"all of the upper management at the large bar i work at are either enabling or working together to get incredibly intoxicated women to have sex with them in the staff stairwell and i don't know how to stop this.. tw: sexual assault

i (22/f) started working at this large 4 story pub/cocktail bar/nightclub in australia 3 months ago. i worked mainly on the rooftop cocktail bar. a month ago i saw my 40 year old head bartender (s) flirting with a girl who looked barely 18. they disappeared even though he was on the clock and supposed to be supervising me. she, n, was extremely drunk because he kept feeding her drinks. hours later i ran into her at a bar i went to after my shift, she seemed more sober. we got to chatting and she told me s said he wanted to kiss her and grabbed her hand, pulling her into the staff stairwell. she kept saying she didn't want to have sex, but he kept pushing her until he got her to give him a blow job. she felt uncomfortable about the whole thing. there's an inherent power dynamic at play, plus he's dead sober and she was wasted (unable to consent).

i report this to our head manager two days later for the cocktail bar (d). he immediately tells me not to tell anyone else and he says he will look at the footage. he asks me ""what was she wearing?"" and ""how drunk was she?"" he says women hit on bartenders all the time. nothing happens and two days after that i run into an old coworker (a). i'm talking to her about this and she tells me d used to constantly sexually harass her, asking to ""see her tits,"" trying to take pics up her skirt with his phone, groping her ass etc. a made a report to upper upper management and hr and nothing happened because in their words, ""as you know, the owner of name of bar is currently in a very public sexual assault case with an old employee who he supposedly took advantage of at the company party. another case would ruin the bar's rep entirely."" 

i then find out after talking to n again (we had exchanged numbers), that almost a year prior when n was visiting the bar, manager d pulled her into the stairwell too, when she was so drunk she could hardly walk. she kept saying ""no"" and he took her hand and shoved it down his pants, pushed her against a wall etc., until she shoved him and left. he didn't rape her, but he did force her to touch him, quite violently. a had also told me that bartender s and d would work together to target drunk women and take turns taking them to the stairwell. 

i was so sickened by all of this that i then reported it to the highest manager, r. i only reported n's story about s (sorry for all the confusion) because that was the most recent one, which i was sure was on camera. r wasn't surprised and said he'd have a look at the camera footage. i then find out the next day, from overhearing a manager in the stairwell (sound echoes) that apparently the footage was deleted from that night, probably by d who i reported it to first. 

i'm sorry this was all over the place and very confusing. i know most of it is hearsay but after seeing my management's responses i am very concerned by the predatory behavior which is allowed at the bar. is there anything i can do, from a legal standpoint, to try and stop this. i'm worried for women who come to the bar. i'm disgusted by how much this is brushed off. i am consistently sexually harassed at the bar and nothing happens when i report it (another less important story). can the police do anything? thank you.",2
"i found it disgusting that reddit (the community) was so quick to condemn a man facing unevidenced and uncorroborated sexual assault accusations. we have kavanaugh, and we have his accuser. his accuser has so far provided no evidence and found no one to back up her story and can remember no further details of the event, whilst the accused is able to reasonably refute the accusations. yet despite everything, the reddit community was so quick to condemn him and portray him as guilty.

it gets even more repulsive. the community then decides to attack kavanaugh's temperament during the hearing. as if the anonymous commenters would remain unhurt and un-angry and un-tearful if they had a 20yr reputation destroyed by an unevidenced sexual assault accusation and would not cry if their family had been hurled slime and sent death threats. how dare they

"if you already have financing lined up for a car, don't give the car dealership your social security number.. car dealerships are often very sleazy. one of the tricks that's been attempted on me and relatives is the dealership stating that they need your social security number to complete a sale if you have your own financing.

this is not true. the irs rules on transactions over 10k are for *cash* transactions not bank checks. they are trying to get your social security number to run a credit report on you so that they can come back and try to talk you out of your own financing. this credit pull has the potential to lower your credit score *depending on your circumstances*.

i buy used, my cu has better rates than dealerships plus i'd rather deal with my cu over whatever financing the dealership has. just wanted to give everyone a heads up because it's something to be added to the long list of things to look out for when buying a car.

the fact that so many self described car salesman say you do shows just how pervasive the training they get to garner your ssn. there are apparently some states that require a ssn for titling but those are the minority of states, most only require a drivers license.

edit2: for the people saying ""the dealership would never run your credit without your explicit permission"" please read the dozens of replies where other people have said this happened to them. advocating being cavalier with your ssn is terrible advice. beyond negative effects on credit (which i admit may only happen in certain circumstances) giving your ssn out to people that do not legally need it is terrible advice.",10

so the first time we show up, we get there an hour early and i am the first person standing in line. a couple minutes or so go by and a lady approaches me and says something to the effect of ""just so you know, you weren't here first. other people were in there cars before you got here"". i am a little taken aback and say ""no, the line starts when someone starts standing in front of the building"". i was certain i was in the right and that this was just one odd lady and that nearly everyone would agree with me.

"ca a student at the preschool i work at is only being taught a fictional language. i'm twenty, and i work part-time as an assistant at a small daycare in california.

there is a four year old who speaks very very little and poor english. knows the most basic of words but is at the level of maybe a two year old english-wise compared to the other kids, including several who are both native spanish/english speakers. basically knows ""yes"", ""no"", ""juice"", etc. 

he's only been here for less than a month and i've seen his incredibly limited vocab double in that time. i'm embarrassed to say it but i'm very uneducated about this type of thing and i thought he was speaking portuguese or something similar up until last week. the kids are split into small groups by age and i'm usually not in charge of his group unless it's at the end of the day, in my defense.

the hosts of the daycare are very into nerd culture and some of the daycare is very decorated with (child friendly) sci-fi and fantasy stuff. i'm not too into it myself but i like listening to them and i (usually) like their passion.

one day i was curious what language the child was speaking so i looked up what portuguese actually sounded like and realized it wasn't that. looked up a lot of languages and for the life of me could not identify it. the single dad who picked him up looked like a nice dude and one day he was one of the last people to pick up that day so i asked him what language his kid spoke.

the bosses of the daycare were there too when i asked and they all suddenly got big smiles on their faces and explained to me in depth that the guy was a linguistics hobbyist who was trying to recreate an experiment where he raises his kid to speak a language from the tv show star trek (klingon.)

he explained how at home he only has spoken klingon (which is apparently a real full language) to the kid and that's all he knows. my bosses love that he is doing this and he does too, he told me to look up the experiment and read about it. my bosses even learned a small bit of the language themselves so that when they talk to the kid they don't say it. 

it sounded kinda cool at the time but i didn't really think about it too much. when i looked it up i found out that the guy who did it taught his kid klingon and english at the same time. i assumed that this guy was doing the same and i just misunderstood but when i clarified next time he confirmed that the kid was only being taught klingon on purpose and he was going to try and continue the ""experiment"" for as long as possible. 

he also told me about his blog and i checked it out where he describes this all and he basically states in it that he is fully aware that this will make it ""slightly"" hard for the kid to speak english later but that the experience is worth it. he even has limited the kids intake of media very severely so far to avoid shows with a lot of speaking/words.

the kid is fairly isolated and generally acts a bit socially ""off"", if i can say that without being mean. not like misbehaving but he clearly has small issues interacting with kids his age who all talk a lot already.

i've brought it up casually with my bosses but they basically love this dude and what he is doing and don't see a problem with it. i feel terrible but i feel like i should report this? is this child abuse? this guy basically is mispurposely not teaching his kid to how to interact with other people for the level of ""it's just a social experiment bro"", it's nuts to me.

if i'm wrong and this isn't dangerous i apologize. it feels awful to me though. i like my job otherwise but if i had to lose it for this i could find another one, have some savings, i feel too bad for this kid.",2

**edit 2, thank you all for the kind words and for breaking things down in an easy to understand way. i appreciate everyone who helped me to understand my daughter. it seems as though /u/pods_and_cigarettes was very spot on. my wife confirmed that my daughter was on adderall, and considering my daughter did end up experimenting with harder drugs later before she passed, it makes a lot of sense. it hurts to read this and know my daughter is basically telling me how her addiction started, but i'm still forever grateful that i am able to understand her better. thank you again, kind strangers.**

**final edit: i'm in tears as i write this. as crappy as the internet can be, it really makes me happy to see so much kindness from strangers. this is a difficult subject for me, and i started off annoyed at my daughter (i know, that was very wrong) for being cryptic, then angry at myself at being so stupid, and now i am just amazed at how talented my daughter was. i still am no where near good enough to really grasp poems or symbolism, but with help, you've helped me come closer and made me realize that a few simple sentences can tell a very long story. 

it hurts so much to know my daughter was suffering, and i'm afraid to know what else i might find out in her other poems. but i'm so grateful for the chance to get to know her better. i wish it had been sooner, maybe things would be different, but there is no point in dwelling on that. 

i know every parent thinks their kid is amazing. i'm not exception to that. but i wish you all could have known her. i swear she was destined for great things. she was so kind and caring, she truly cared about everyone and i don't think i ever heard her talk bad about anyone, even people who deserved it. whenever i would watch the news in the morning, she would sometimes get so upset by the stories, that she would cry. i never understood that, because although bad things happening to people is sad to me, since i don't know them on a personal level, it's hard to feel anything other than a distant sadness. my daughter seemed to feel everyone's pain very deeply. she said she wanted to write stories and paint pictures that brought people joy, and that she wanted to use all the money she made to help the world become a better place. i think she would have done that, i really do. i wish i had told her how much i loved her art, but she never showed me, and i think part of that is because i didn't understand a lot of it, because i never really tried. 

my daughter was 20 when she passed. the last 2 years of her life was troubling, and some of those reasons have always been a mystery to me and my wife. this not only helps us understand... but i feel like this may give us some closure. she made some bad choices in her life, and i did not want to bring this up because i was scared i would read bad comments about her. i know how harsh the internet can be, and i know i should just ignore them, but reading those interpretations put me in such a sensitive state that i couldn't handle seeing anyone calling my little girl something bad. she made mistakes, but she was still such a beautiful and kind person, inside and out. 

sorry if i'm rambling. i'm so upset, excited, tired, and happy. thank you all again for listening to an old fart vent and taking me by the hand and helping me. i'm going to go take a long nap.**

**final, final, edit** i woke up to a ton of new comments and messages. i am touched and i can't thank you all enough for helping me and sending me such kind words. i really appreciate it and i will try to reply back to all of you, especially those who took the time to write long messages. it might take a few days. also, thanks to whoever bought me gold. seriously, thanks for making me realize how special and wonderful my little girl truly was. i'm so grateful.
