"update 3 my wife named our son after her first love and i had no idea.. so i want to start out by saying think you for all the support. most of you guys have been great with the exception of a few trolls calling me a cuck. 

so i came home the next day after staying the night else where. she didn't really say much to me other then hey and went back to messing around on her laptop. i went up stairs and put my things in the guest room and layed down to take a nap because i didn't get much sleep the night before. she came in and asked what i was doing and i told her that until she's ready to sit down and have a adult conversation about the name that i would be sleeping in here. she rolled her eyes and said that she thought i had got over and asked why i even bothered to come home if i was going to act like this. i told her because it is my home and i'm not going to miss out on time with my son just because you don't have the ability to tell right from wrong or atleast admit it. she stormed off and that was that for that day. 

the next day she i came home from work and she was on the couch waiting for me.  she asked what it was going to take for us to get back to normal. i told her that we would need to see a marriage counciler first off and consider changing our son's name to his middle name. the look of rage on her face when i said that last part was something i don't think i've ever seen before. i hate to say it but it mad me a little happy to see it. she told me to go fuck myself and that was never going to happen and stormed off. we didn't talk the rest of that day.

the next day rolled around and my wife hadn't gotten home from work. someone started knocking on the door and it was her parents. they said we need to talk so i invited them in we sat down. they said they know what she did was wrong and they always knew and so did her whole family and all her friends. they apologized to me for keeping it a secret and said that they agree with counseling and they would be happy to pay for it but changing his name is going to far. i told them thank you and that i haven't made that decision with out a lot of consideration. i told them that you really don't know what you would do till you're in this situation. after a little more talking they left and asked me not to tell my wife they stopped by. i agreed. shortly after they left i called around and found a counciler and made appointment that worked with both our work schedules. 

when my wife came her i told her about the appointment and she just walked off not saying a word. our appointment is thursday and i'm still sleeping in the guest room. that's what's been going on so far. thank you guys and i'll try to update you again when i can.

edit. i just want say i'm not just going to up and change the name. it's something i'm considering. i want to talk to the counciler first to see what impact it might have if any and how to go about it if there are none",7

"it's perfectly ok for a man to hit a woman back if she hit him first. the most popular argument against this is that ""*men are stronger*"". yes, but why pick a fight with someone far stronger than you? if i walk into a gym and punched the biggest guy there in the face, should i cry foul if he hits back?

granted, i can't exactly call it self-defense. chances are, a woman hitting a man isn't exactly a threat to his life. but it doesn't have to be. she is trying to cause him pain. he should have the right to cause her pain in return. i'm not saying he should go ape-shit on her and send her into a coma, but at the same time he should have the right hit her with the intention of causing her pain.

far too often i see women hitting men *knowing* they won't hit back. this expectation that men won't hit back encourages women like this to be aggressive. men don't pick fights with bigger men because they have a rational fear of the bigger guy hitting back. too often, women use this expectation of chivalry as armor.",6
"r/politics should be demonized just as much as r/the_donald was and it's name is misleading and should be changed. r/politics convenes in the same behaviour that td did, brigading, propaganda, harassment, misleading and user abuse. it has no place on the frontpage until reformed.. scroll through the list of articles currently on /r/politics. try posting an article that even slightly provides a difference of opinion on any topic regarding to trump and it will be removed for ""off topic"".  

try commenting anything that doesn't follow the circlejerk and watch as you're instantly downvoted and accused of shilling/trolling/spreading propaganda.  

i'm not talking posts or comments that are ""maga"", i'm talking about opinions that differ slightly from the narrative. anything that offers a slightly different viewpoint or may point blame in any way to the circlejerk.  

/r/politics is breeding a new generation of rhetoric. they've normalized calling dissidents and people offering varying opinions off the narrative as  nazi's, white supremacists, white nationalists, dangerous, bots, trolls and the list goes on.  

they've made it clear that they think it's okay to harrass, intimidate and hurt those who disagree with them.

this behaviour is just as dangerous as what /r/the_donald was doing during the election. the brigading, the abuse, the harrassment but for some reason they are still allowed to flood /r/popular and thus the front page with this dangerous rhetoric.  

i want /r/politics to exist, but in it's current form, with it's current moderation and standards, i don't think it has a place on the front page and i think at the very least it should be renamed to something that actually represents it's values and content because at this point having it called /r/politics is in itself misleading and dangerous.  

**edit**: thank you for the gold, platinum and silver. i never thought i'd make the front page let alone from a throwaway account or for a unpopular opinion no less. 

to answer some of the most common questions i'm getting, it's a throwaway account that i made recently to voice some of my more conservative thoughts even though i haven't yet really lol, no i'm not a bot or a shill, i'm sure the admins would have taken this down if i was and judging by the post on /r/the_donald about this they don't seem happy with me either. also not white nor a fascist nor russian. 

it's still my opinion that /r/politics should be at the very least renamed to something more appropriate like /r/leftleaning or /r/leftpolitics or anything that is a more accurate description of the subreddit's content. /r/the_donald is at least explicitly clear with their bias, and i feel it's only appropriate that at a minimum /r/politics should reflect their bias in their name as well if they are going to stay in /r/popular

"if you're ever in a car crash don't tell anyone the accident was your fault even if you think it might be. do not sign any document unless it's for the police or your insurance agent.. this is why you have an insurance company. let them handle it. the more you say at the scene, the more problems you might cause in your defense later. be polite, but when it comes to assessing what happened its best to stay quiet.  take photos of all vehicles involved and the accident scene and help anyone who might be injured, if it is safe to do so. 

you may think that the crash was 100% your fault and later learn that there were other factors that contributed to the crash that were outside of your control.

"today i had to relieve myself on the street. i have created a throwaway accpunt here because my wife knows my username and i would greatly like for her never to know my shame. i have recently changed careers from a desk job to a more physicslly demanding career. becase of this my eating and digestive habits have drastically shifted. i havent gone poop in a couple days. this happens from time to time and has necer really been an issue. today i pulled up in front of a new friends house for only the second time. he lives in downtown of a close city. right on a busy street near a well lit intersection. the moment i step out of the car i feel the tummy rumblins start. now he is a cool dude but i do not know him well enough to unleash this hell in his bathroom. i look across the street longingly to where there is a store with a public restroom. i take two steps towards the store only to realize i dont have that kind of time. i figure i'll bite the bullet and just run into his house. only then i realize this too is not gonna be close enough. i step beside my car in a panic as i start to feel something leak through my clenched defenses. i process all my options and settle on what i see is my only option. i face my back to the car on the passenger side so the road cant see pull my pants down and blow a foul geiser of doarrhea all over my bumper the street amd a little on the sidewalk. i pull up the shorts and run to the public restroom to wash myself off. nothing got on my clothes and to the best of,my knowledge noone saw. the entire poop took less than 20 seconds before i could plug the damn until i could get home. now my car smells until i get it washed tomorrow but otherwise i got away clean. im almost a little proud to have gotten away with it.

"for not being attracted to my girlfriend's body?. i made an alt account to ask this, since a bunch of my family follow my primary one.
i'm also.. not completely sure of the rules here, so i'll try to keep it as pg as i can.

so, me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost 3 years. we have fun together, and we really care about each other. (just to keep it simple.)
i will say that she's the first thin person i've ever been with. she's flat, petite and pretty short. most of the girls i've been with have been on the bigger side (in the good places..) and i've always been a fan of ... well, a bigger ~chest~ size.
this all started when me and my girlfriend were watching netflix a few nights ago and she randomly asked me if i was okay with her having a flat chest. (she's always been insecure about not having b**bs.) i asked why she was curious about this, and she told me she noticed that i never really had anything to say about her chest, (and that day she had been trying on lingerie and none of the ones she tried on fit her in the *chest* region. that kind of put her back mental funk where she thinks she's not attractive if she doesn't have a certain figure.) she said she was just curious.
i told her i had to be honest, and said that i'm not attracted to her chest size, and that i actually prefer bigger b-bs. it's not a turn off, having a smaller size but not a turn on. if i'm being honest, that's why i usually prefer she faces away from me during intercourse.
she was quiet for a while, and then she said she was going to go home since she had work in the morning. she texted me later on that night and told me what i said hurt her a little. she said we've been dating for a while and never brought this up, and that she feels like i lied to her. i told her i didn't know what to tell her, and that i was just being honest (i was.).

am i being the asshole here?

"for walking into my flatmate's room while she was having sex and refusing to leave?. i (20m) live in a flat with 5 others at university. there is one girl (20f), who's a bit of a...problem

she always brings guys back and has loud audible sex with them. very loud. and it annoys all of us, we have early starts in the morning and well tell her to keep it down but she doesn't listen. we told security and they didn't do shit.

so we also all have exams soon and essay deadlines. and yesterday, she does it again, brings a guy back and starts having loud sex. we're all awake on this and post on the flat chat (but she wasn't going to see it anyway until after she was done having sex).

i have an early start and had to be somewhere by 7am and it was 2am while this was happening.

i had had enough. i banged on her door and she wouldn't open it. i bang again and she doesn't open. so i try to open it and...it's unlocked, they must have forgotten to lock it given that they came back drunk.

so i walk in and see them having sex. they both quickly see me and freak out. she says to me ''what the fuck?!!'' but i look over to the guy, the guy was a bit short and really skinny, there's no way in hell he would be a threat to me and he looked way more nervous than she does. 

she keeps saying ''what the fuck?!! get out!!'' and i say to her ''i've had enough of your fucking shit. we've all had enough of your fucking shit, you piece of shit. we're trying to sleep''. 

the guy is standing there awkwardly so i tell him ''get the fuck out'' and he doesn't do anything just stands there awkwardly, so i tell him ''i'll fucking call security, and i've got 4 other flatmates to back me up, our words against yours so get the fuck out!!'' and he gets his clothes on and runs out the flat. 

so the ''problem'' girl starts crying and i tell her that she needs to sort her life out, i then to say to her ''please leave this flat, move out. no one here fucking likes you, not even that guy you just fucked likes you enough to stay'' and she screams at me and calls me fucking cunt and asshole.

i then leave and go to back to my room. i told the others what happened and they agreed with me, there's nothing else i could have done. in fact they thanked me, at least we could get to sleep and now we sent her a message, aita?

**to those saying that the other flatmates are all guys, that's not true. aside from the bitch, there are two girls, and the rest guy.**

**to the people telling me that i should have spoken nicely to her, i said in the first few paragraphs i already did this. me and the other flatmates asked her nicely to stop on several occasions and she didn't follow through. what she did was say ''okay'' and then continue to do the same shit. i'm writing this as a clarification for those comments.**",3

update to this post.

the comments helped me calm down a little, i really needed that. i was really stressing tf out. and yeah i know i'm stupid, didn't really think my actions through.. i did went back to her soon after my post and well, we cried hah. we've both had a lot of time to think and we've met everyday to talk, and we're pretty much 100% certain what's going to happen. so she revealed that she wants a relationship and be exclusive with me and asked me to seriously think about it, and that she wanted to know what i wanted before making a decision. and well yeah, i pretty much realized i don't know why we're not dating.. lots of common interests. always lots of fun together and the same sense of humor. good chemistry in general. but i honestly thought i was only interesting as a fwb to her, because of our age difference. but apparently (lucky me) not. so i told her i want to be with her too, and after lots of discussion we agreed to go for an abortion.

 one thing she said stood out for me. she is serious about us, and wants to make it this work. and starting off with a child this early in the relationship is going to be very tough, so the chance that our relationship will survive is slim, and she doesn't want to take that risk. and she didn't plan on having kids for a few more years, and obviously i feel the same way. so yeah who knows maybe she or i will change our mind but this is the plan for now. luckily abortion is legal in my country. thanks for the advice everyone. on one hand i'm ridiculously happy that i'm now officially with her, like i honestly thought that wasn't a possibility.  but yeah the situation kinda sucks. and yes we'll be using condoms..",7
"private driveway being used as public roadway and im being accessed for its upkeep (fl). purchased 30 acres of land and built a house several years back in central florida, had a driveway installed that cuts across the center of my property allowing me to exit on either of two main roads.

i now have traffic using my driveway as a shortcut between the two roads up to and including 18 wheelers and other large vehicles since using my driveway cuts off nearly half an hour of travel time between two cities.

i installed pillars and gates on both ends of the driveway and marked it private property but the gates were torn down and the pillars knocked over.

i have contacted the county about it and they sent out a guy from code compliance who looked around for a few minutes and left.

i have now received a notice about not keeping the roadway to state standards and that the county will be out to perform maintenance bringing the roadway up to standards, ie. widening it and repaving which i will be personally responsible for paying for.

ive told them if they want it to be a public road then fine buy me out and ill move elsewhere but they refuse to do so.

as of right now i have removed half the driveway past my house and put up signs and markers stating dead end road and now the county is threatening to have me arrested for destruction of public property.

&#x200b;

before anyone asks, no, there are no easements on this property anywhere near the area the driveway goes through and no easements in any form that travel in that direction on the property, closest thing is a power company easement along the southern edge of the land.

"treasurydirect.gov isn't talked about enough. i see a lot of discussions on where the best bank to park your cash is, who has the best interest rates etc. i rarely see anyone mention treasury direct as an option. it's the website to buy treasury securities from the us government directly. the website is easy to use and navigate, setting up an account takes 5 minutes, and links directly to your pre existing bank account. 4 week tbills are currently yielding over 2.4%, which is more than you can get pretty much anywhere else. for cash management purposes i would highly recommend checking it out, especially if you're saving for something like a house and can't take any risk. they offer automatic reinvestments for up to two years at a time than you can vance whenever you want, and the website does a great job of explaining everything for you. if you're concerned about having your money locked up for 4 weeks at a time, you can split the money into 1/4s and buy the auction each week, set them to auto reinvest and if you end up needing the money stop the auto reinvestments and the cash will be deposited back into your bank account at the end of the term.

there are no fees, and no minimums, all your money stays in your current bank and is withdrawn when you purchase a security. proceeds from maturity are automatically sent back to your bank unless you reinvest. plus it's the us government so you don't have to worry about who you're doing business with, or have to keep searching and switching banks to find the best rates.",10

"for not caring when my friend came out of the closet?. my friend is obviously gay. he does nails with the girls, he follows make-up tutorials on youtube, speaks in a higher tone of voice, and flails around a lot. he also gushes with the girls in our group when they bring up k-pop celebs (guys) and joins them for shopping when we split up at the mall.

we (the guys) know he's gay, the girls most certainly do, and it's pretty much an open secret at this point. nobody ever brings it up, and we basically just treat him like another girl.

"prosthetics: can someone born without a limb (rather than losing it after birth) use advanced prosthetics controlled by nerves and neural pathways?. i understand (or at least, i think i do to some degree) that if someone loses an arm, for example, cutting-edge prosthetics can utilize nerves and existing neural pathways to control the prosthetics.  let's say instead, however, that someone is born with an arm that stops short of the elbow due to a birth defect/genetic condition.  at no point have they had an elbow, or forearm, hand... if he are she is born this way i presume that there is no neural pathways/nerves to dock onto.  i am sure that technology will continue to advance so i guess i am not asking if it likely will ever be possible but rather if it is possible with existing tech and approaches.

the inspiration for this question is the video that has made more than a few circulations around the internet: a video where a little boy (maybe a few years old) with arms that stopped just short of the elbow who was interacting with his newborn sibling.  he utilizes his arms and mouth to pick up his sibling's pacifier and put it in her mouth.  a very heart warming video.  many of the responses commented how jealous they were that he would grow up to have awesome android arms.  but one comment asked whether it would be possible to have these and cited concerns that there might not be neural pathways to use them.

any thoughts?

**edit:** thanks so much for the response everybody!  this is my very first post to reddit after years of lurking... first, let me say that i was totally overselling my confidence when it comes to how much i understood about this subject at a base level.  to clarify the question, i believe what i was picturing in my question was what is referred to as a myoelectric prosthetic. that seems to be the system of prosthesis that is most commonly featured in videos and articles.  i will briefly read up on the basics of myoelectric systems before trying to read any more responses. while i am definitely interested in the use of neurons with prosthetics, the question is probably more appropriately:

can someone born without a limb as opposed to losing a limb later in life use myoelectric prosthetics? why or why not?",9

"for demanding access to my fiance's bank accounts?. edit 1: wow, thank you all so much for you input. i will post an update in a day or so

edit 2: please stop giving me awards this is a throwaway account. spend your money on people who make dank memes

the title sounds harsh, but hear me out.

my fiance and i are late 20's, have been together for 6 years(with a three month period we were broken up, but we don't really count that), set to marry in 2 years, summer 2021.

i make pretty good money for my age. in fact, i make more money than any of my friends or family, and i would bet i'm in the ""1%"" of my community. i try to sound humble but this is important to my argument. i should also add when we started dating, i was delivering pizzas for minimum wage and going to college full time for my degree, so the ""gold digger"" argument just isn't there.

my fiance 5 months ago lost her job as a waitress. she was fired for no-call no showing 3 days in a row to attend her uncle's funeral.  since then, she hasn't worked. i really didn't mind at all. i make enough for us both to have some major cushion. 

i am against joint bank accounts entirely, so instead i just would venmo her some cash weekly. it was $400 for awhile and everyone was okay.

she has been complaining more and more about how she's ""broke"", doesn't have enough to survive etc. i know this isn't true because i shop weekly and fill our kitchen with food, our bathroom with toiletries, pay every bill etc etc.  she has been hinting at wanting more money from me.

i shudder to say ""allowance"", but that's what it seems to be.

i told her i would give her more on one condition: she gives me her bank account details so i could see exactly what she was spending it on. i could see the clothes, fast food and other trinkets she brought home, but i hadn't a clue how she was blowing through all that cash, sometimes in one day when she only goes shopping once a week with me.

she blew up. telling me i wasn't trusting her and how i was the one against joint bank accounts so i should understand her privacy. yeah, huge red flags all over the place.

i talked to my sister and therapist about this and they both took her side, saying i was not respecting her privacy when i'm the one that demands it also.

"my (20f) boyfriend (20m) wouldn't listen to me when i said no. advice for when i talk to him about it?. we went to see a movie and he started touchy in the movie theater. i told him to stop because someone might see and i didn't wanna get in trouble. he said he wouldn't make it obvious and no one would be able to tell and i told him no but he continued anyway. i guess it's partly my fault since i had told him before about a public sex fantasy but i didn't wanna do it. he was finger banging me in the movie theater and it was awkward and i really didn't want anyone to see us. then he had the audacity to ask me to come to the bathroom with him. i told him no wtf sit down and he was grumpy. 

i wanna tell him that it was seriously not okay for him to just keep going. even if my main concern was being obvious and he thought he could keep it discreet, i still said no. and we were in public, i didn't wanna yell at him or something in front of people so i didn't say anything. but i'm actually annoyed.",7
"my brother molested my girlfriend's niece and everything is as bad as you can imagine, i don't know what to do at this point?. yes, he's in prison and will be for a long time. meanwhile the niece is receiving therapy. english is not my first language so please bare with me.

for context my brother is a lot older than me and we never really connected, yet he was/is a mama's boy and our mother encouraged us to see each other. i obliged because our mother started developing parkinson's disease and i didn't want her upset over her darling boy and second son not talking. i've always known my brother to really like chatting up women and people called him a 'sex pest' 'creep' or a wannabe 'lady's man' yet never in a million years did i think he would have a thing for or do anything to children. people still believe he is innocent. another thing to mention my brother is a very confident person, calculated, and manipulative, very few people can tell he's lying.

with my gf we dated for a year, moved in together and had a generally normal relationship. my brother of course tried to hit on her multiple times and she brushed him off then told me which caused major strain with me, my brother, and mother. especially because my brother and mother tried blaming my gf, yet i know what my brother is like and my mother is in denial about it. for a period of time i banned him away from our house. however later my gf's sister, bil, and niece came to stay because her sister was pregnant with the second child and we were discussing leaving the niece at our place because the baby was going to require surgery and a hospital stay after birth that could last up to a month.

we decided to keep my gf's niece with us for the time especially so the niece could stay with her aunt. my gf and niece are fairly close so we thought it was a good idea especially with the baby while both parents were stressed and worried. then my pos brother had to fuck it up like the cunt he is. my mother started hounding me over allowing my gf's family over but not allowing my brother over so i obliged under heavy supervision he was around. my brother was being mysteriously nice and well behaved, he also was buying us things, playing games with the niece so she actually did like him and was excited when he was around.

my brother then decided he was a handy man and helped with minor adjustments to the house, he would find excuse after excuse to come over to the point i was finding it partly daunting. my gf just ignored him and i didn't realise he was losing interest in my gf at time. when everything came out the signs became clear mainly after what occurred. in a very short period of time my gf's niece started becoming sad which we thought was because she was missing her parents so we bought her lots of toys, read to her, took her on trips to beach, zoo, shows, let her stay up, watch her favourite shows, and so on trying to make everything fun as possible. what we didn't notice was my brother was sometimes alone with her for very short periods of time which he used to his advantage.

it all come out when my gf noticed her niece was oddly quiet in the bath her niece is usually singing and splashing in the water, (my girlfriend went into the kitchen to get a cup or something it was only a few minutes), my brother was meant to be outside helping in the garden, i was in the garage when i heard screaming. i ran inside and my gf was beating up my brother who was trying to restrain her. i held onto him and my gf grabbed my niece and locked them in a room then called the police. my brother was saying he didn't do anything and ""accidentally"" walked in on the niece then my gf attacked hence i knew immediately he was lying. the police arrived and arrested him.

we found out my brother was actively grooming the niece then started getting physical with kissing and inappropriate touching, then my gf found him molesting her niece in the bath tub. he would use whatever minimal time he had to get to her, sometimes the amount of time he used was so brief it was like he was enjoying the thrill of possibly getting caught. with the bathtub incident he was meant to be outside and like the snake he is he waited for an opportunity to strike. it wasn't like the niece was left alone for hours on end, the door was left open so my gf could hear her while she went to get something then comeback. the niece is in primary school and can be left alone for brief periods of time. no one thought he would be doing this.

when we went to court several women came forward about sexual harassment from him, he would target women in his workplace or close by him with behaviour that he could try excuse, he was a peeping tom, and he would target women when they're drunk offering a ride home or something. it literally came off as a game to him where he pushed boundaries and limits to see what he could get away with. shockingly he apparently developed a form of humanity and admitted to what he did to the niece saying he has never done anything to a child prior and wanted see what it would be like. just a horrible person. 

my mother refuses to believe he did it and i went no contact with her because i'm honestly sick of her shit. i later remembered when my brother and i were children he was the golden boy and she paraded him around like an item, he could do nothing wrong and never had consequences for his actions. it's also the main reason our parents divorced because she refused to see what she was raising and wouldn't allow our father to get him therapy. i'm pretty sure she's a narcissist who raised a sociopath. i had moved in with our dad after the divorce because i hated the pair of them and before our dad died in my 20s, he told me how our relatives would always talk about how lovely and kind i am yet say they would 'keep an eye' on my brother while my dad said no matter what he did he couldn't feel love for or from my brother as if it was just missing from him. that of course scared me yet 15 years+ later when i'm in my 30s and my brother is almost 50 years old it was sort of lost on me.

now with the relationship with my girlfriend. we have been sleeping in different rooms with limited talking. her family basically blames me and my entire family and to some degree my gf. my gf told me she cannot face her sister because she feels as if she failed her family and ruined her niece's life when it's my pos brother's fault. i feel as if i ruined my gfs and her niece's life because of what my brother did. i'm trying to get us both into counselling/therapy while my gf has requested leave off work and i am preparing to too. after everything was said and done with my brother in prison, being home is utterly horrible and i have no idea what to do to even slightly repair this. this is the first time i've cried in years and i feel terrible for my gf's niece, gf, and gf's family. i do not know what to do next, i also keep wishing i terminated my brother when i had the chance. i have never hated anyone more in my life while i think my mother should be locked up with him.",7

"ca grandmother gave my brother and me an equal share portfolio each in the late 90's when we were kids. brother sold his when they were worth a car. i left mine in and now they're a substantial amount. brother and his girlfriend want my half now.. when my brother was 16 and i was 4 my grandmother set aside a share portfolio for us. as soon as we were old enough it was transfered into our own accounts, and it was only four years later that my brother dipped heavily into his and bought a new honda.

i knew about mine for much longer than he did before it became mine, and watched it grow since i understood what it was. by the time i was given full control it was already worth a ridiculous amount because a big portion of it was invested in apple, and i'm torn on using the funds locked up as they are, because dad drilled it into me to leave it to grow until i'm forty something.

i don't talk much with my brother, he's done some stupid things to the family over the years and i didn't really grow up with him so all i usually hear about his life comes through dad. his new girlfriend works in law though, and i've received a formal letter from them both that the investments my grandmother made were designed to be for both of us to use not just for me alone, and his was only around $15000. the number is right but mine was only worth that at the time he spent it too. they want half of the value of mine now and his girlfriend has informed me if i don't give them access then the legal fees and fines would eat up my half and i'd be left with nothing.

the dividends alone support a huge part of my life and they've saved me a few times. if half of that disappeared it'd set me back years. i know it sounds selfish but i'm really used to having the extra income back me up when i've wanted to move. i've lived in four states by my own choice and i want to move and take in more before i settle down, if i ever do.

how likely is it they'll win and leave me with nothing? as far as i know there was no paperwork or will just my grandmother's word. she set up my brother's accounts when he turned 19, but she gave them to dad at the same time as my brother got his, and dad transfered the whole lot to me six years ago. for my share i have all the logins, the trading accounts and bank accounts are in my name, and the shares are all solely in my name too. should i find my own lawyer and if i need one what kind do i need? i have an accountant i've used for years but this doesn't seem like an accounts problem but a law one.",2

my mother (divorced) and my sister want to park that car next to my sister's house (we live in the sw desert) for the next six years so that my niece will have a car when she turns 16.  this would be a minimal cost, storage insurance, etc.

tl;dr i'm free

i really want to thank each one of you who commented on my previous post. this wasn't a decision i took lightly and it took a great deal of swallowing my pride. 

i would like to say i dumped him as soon as i read everyone's comment about him being abusive. unfortunately it took me a bit longer to come to my senses. the following things happened after my post...

i tried to talk to him about being unhappy and saying he needs to leave. he told me to shut up and leave him alone. i told him i'm not leaving until we finish talking. he started to do the dishes and he said if i didn't shut up he was going to start to break a dish for every word i said. i didn't stop talking. he threw a bowl at my feet and i stepped in glass. he started profusely apologizing after he realized my foot was bleeding. he telling me he loves me. i stupidly forgave him.

later he called my work screaming at me to get the fuck home. i kept asking why? he told me get the fuck home now or i'm going to kill myself. i start crying and freaking out because he has the kids and i hear the baby crying. i start asking is the baby ok? he says shut up and get the fuck home. hangs up. i panic and leave work right away. i try calling him the whole drive home (20minutes). i'm panicking thinking my children are in danger. i come home and it turns out the baby pooped in his diaper and things got a little messy when trying to change him.. i was like are you serious? i told him i understand he was stressed out but he can never call me like that at work ever again. he called me selfish and a cunt.

when i realized in that moment i feared him hurting my baby.. i knew this had to end. regardless of how much i thought i loved him. if his mom stopped watching the kids.. i'd figure it out but i couldn't do this my whole life. i was exhausted physically and emotionally. i didn't care if i was alone forever because no one wants a single mom of 2 kids.. i just wanted to live in peace. 

so the day i did it. i couldn't talk to him in person because he would twist my words around and i did not want to be subjected to more violence. i wrote him a letter. i wrote down everything i could think of. i recalled every memory of him that has scarred me over the last 8 years. i told him i already do this alone it's time for me to actually be alone. with the letter was my ring he gave me. i told him don't fight this. you can contact me but only to see the kids. i had packed a bag and went to my parents. i told him i would gather the rest of things in a few weeks.

it's been hard. i wake up in panic thinking what have i done but then i come to my senses and realize how calm i feel. i don't feel like i'm walking on egg shells anymore. i don't even care if he's right and no one else wants me. i'm happy again. thank you reddit. i don't think i would've finally gotten the courage with you guys. 

edit: wow i did not expect this response. thank you so much for the support. i just wanted to clear up some things.
i will not be going over alone. i originally planned on bringing my dad but i did not know about the police escort. i will definitely have to look into that.
i will not let him have his children alone. i will drop them off at his parents house for him to visit with them.
i didn't realize when i posted my original post that these were abusive tendencies. i thought because he wasn't physically abusive it didn't count. once people started telling me that wasn't the case i realized this had been going on for over 5 years. he punched holes in all our houses. have thrown several dishes. screamed at the top of his lungs at me. once called me at work because he locked himself out of the house while i was at work. i told him he could either go to his moms for 2 hours or wait for me. he started spamming hate texts saying fuck you bitch, cunt, whore, etc. when i ignored his texts he started calling the phones at work saying the same things. 

lastly people are saying why i had kids with him or why i couldn't see how bad this was. well because i was with him since i was 15. from 15-20 it was great. he was my first love. first everything. i had nothing else to compare it to when the anger started. i thought every relationship had its issues and these were mine. he told me i was the crazy one when i would say something. i love my kids and never regret bringing them into the world. they gave me a purpose.

thanks again..",7
"a guy walks into a bar and sees a jar of $100 bills on the counter. he asks the bartender ""hey, what's with the jar?""

""after that, you have to go outside. around back is where we keep big jim's dog. he's the baddest junkyard dog you've ever seen. you have to go get a tooth out of his mouth. and then, when you're done with that you have to go upstairs. there you'll find big jim's mom. she's 70 years old and never had an orgasm in her life. you've gotta go up there and fuck her to completion.""

the man says ""wow, i can see why the jar is so full.""

after a few hours of drinking the man get sloppy drunk and says ""fuck it,"" slaps down a $100 and jumps up on the bar and runs down and kicks big jim square in the jaw knocking him out cold. the bartender is stunned, as this is the furthest anyone has made it. the man runs outside to the cheers of the patrons and everyone hears snarling and growling and grows silent. moments later they hear the dog whimper and then yelp, then nothing.

moments later the man drunkenly stumbles back in and says ""alright, now where's the old lady with the tooth?""",0
"my(m36) wife (f43) thinks i couldn't be attracted to her and therapist agreed?. background:

married a little over two years, after dating a very short time around 3 months. 

we meet at a work event and i was immediately smitten with my wife. it was like out of a movie i saw her chatting with a group of people and in my head i heard ""oh there she is"". she was newly devorced and took some convincing on my part but we have been together from that night on and get along extremely well.

now for clarity i am extreamly attracted to my wife, we may just still be in the honeymoon stage but i've never felt this way about another women. and becasue it's pertains to the conversation we had today with her therapist i would say the majority of the population would find her attractive and not in a niche way. she is objectively attractive. i feel we are evenly matched in looks, very few people have notice the slight age difference. she however wins in personality (outgoing and charming) and she makes about 3x as much money as i do. 

a couple months ago we ran into an ex of mine, and by ex we literally dated for maybe a month and never exclusive. after my wife mentioned how different they were (age/hair color/body type etc) and it ended in a pretty heated argument. we have had 3/4 conversations since, all of which i was trying to convince my wife i'm not going to leave her for a women i ""dated"" years ago. 

last week she asked if i would go to her therapist with her today and i agreed. she has been seeing her for about 8 years for anxiety and a bout of depression that happed before we meet.

today:

started normal enough and i had figured why we were there so i just jumped into it thinking the therapist would be on my side and would help me calm my wife's fears. that's not what happed.

the therapist did very little talking although their long silences and knowing glances started to piss me off right away.

the thing that stood out to me the most was how my wife reiterated how she doesn't see how i would be attracted to her and the therapist didn't even disagree. like i felt like a crazy person, my wife is beautiful, charming, funny, it feels like i wished her into existence.

she brought up the age difference (7 years?!?), my looks, and how quickly i wanted to get married as all reasons for why i am basically a gold digger. 

first off we both wanted to get married quickly, i asked and figured she would want a long engagement but she didn't so we got married. second i never even discussed money with her until after we were married and never dreamed she made so much more than i do. she said she doesn't think i'm after her money but enjoy the lifestyle while i'm with her and it makes it easier to pretend i'm attracted to her. sorry more attracted to her, like i play it up. 

i'm completely blind sided and don't really want to talk to my family or friends, it's humiliating being accused of marrying someone for a lifestyle.

for clarity: i moved into her house, i rent out my old home but that income just covers the mortgage and the company that manages it. all our money goes into a joint checking with automatic transfers into savings etc. our bills are paid from that account, i looked at our bank account and i spend significantly less than she does each month on average. 

after leaving i'm in a complete panic that she is going to leave me, even though i feel humiliated and love her so much. i immediately wanted to offer to sign a prenup or separate bank accounts or both but i just froze.

my wife seem so sad and i'm so frustrated, i didn't even do anything wrong. the women i've dated in my past don't have a similar type and to be honest i didn't really date, more like hook up for a few months then moved on. i love my wife, she is the first women i have ever met that i have had a real partnership with, like we were a team and now that's all gone. 

i don't feel like i have the strength to leave her, it scares me that i can't even envision a scenario where i would leave. she is my most favorite person.

how do i rebuild trust when i don't feel i ever did anything to lose it. 


edit: my wife didn't come home last night but i texted her this morning. first apologizing for leaving the session and then asking her to come home so we could formulate a plan. no word back yet but i doubt she will check her phone before lunch if she went to work. 

thanks for letting me vent, i've already asked my insurance company to send a list of counselors for me to call later today. hopefully i will find a good fit as i don't even know how to go about picking one.

edit 2: i need a referral from my general doctor before insurance will cover a therapist/psychologist, i have an emergency phone appointment monday and will being seeing someone by myself.

my wife didn't return my text but did come home about an hour later. honestly i cried for the first time in a long time, but was able to get across how seriously i take her concerns. i haven't mentioned anything about her therapist or my feelings about things just apologized and asked for another chance to hear her out completely.

she said she was really drained and is taking a nap, i don't think she made it in to work and am actually looking forward to having the weekend to talk. i'm not going to ask for couples counseling until i talk to my own therapist. 

this is probably it unless i fuck things up this weekend. thanks for letting me type out my feelings and being honest even the hard comments were helpful.",7
"if you are going on a blind date or meeting someone for the first time in person, set an alarm on your phone that will go off about 25-30 minutes in and have it set to your phone's ringtone. you can pretend it is a call and be able to have an excuse to leave if you need to without being rude.. edit: some of y'all are actually big mad and trying to police my post. i never said you had to ghost them after. i never said abandon them and be an asshole. some people just aren't very good under the pressure of the situation to be honest and say they're not interested. a lot of the time people will text after and say they didn't feel chemistry or aren't interested. i am someone who is too nervous to speak much at all on the first encounter, let alone say i'm not interested and leave. if you have the courage to stand up on a date and tell the girl ""yeah i'm not feeling this"" and leave then good for you but some people are too shy to do that.

"for ""double-reporting"" an employee (to his boss, and then to corporate) and probably getting him fired?. my husband and i have a 15 year old son, who is biracial; my husband is african american and i am white (this will be important later on in the story). my son just got his driver's permit and has begun driving with me on a regular basis. the other day we were on the road, and he accidentally cut off a truck, making him have to break abruptly.

i scolded my son and gave a ""sorry"" wave to the driver. at the next red light which came about a minute later, the guy pulled up next to us. his car had a large company logo on it, indicating he was on the job. he rolled down the window and shouted the n-word at my son. my son's face went pale, and he was quiet, depressed and clearly wounded deeply the rest of the drive home. the encounter **sickened** me.

i did some research on the company; at one point i even plugged them into facebook. they have a very active facebook page and seem like an organization that prides themselves on a good image and good customer service. i called the company and reported the man's behavior, describing him very vividly. they informed me that they knew exactly who i was talking about, and that all their drivers drive with a dashcam, so his behavior is on camera. i had a good feeling about the encounter and that they were going to definitely take care of the situation.

two months later, when i was browsing facebook kind of boredly one day, the company's name was recommended in my search, and just for the hell of it i clicked and looked at their page for the first time in two months. one of the very first photos/posts i saw from just a day ago showed a big group of their employees huddled together in their company yard, with some kind of tag about a project they just completed. to my horror, i saw the employee who shouted at my son in the group, grinning widely. meaning they didn't fire him.

the company is part of a nationwide chain, so i called their corporate headquarters, was connected to the highest person i could get to, and i reported the incident to them, and complained about how they didn't fire him. the man i spoke to sounded **disgusted**, way, way more so than the previous person i'd reported him to, apologized profusely, and thanked me very much for telling him. additionally, he made multiple statements about how racists and bigots have ""no place"" and ""no future"" in his company, giving me a strong feeling the offending employee's career is now toast.

was it right of me to ""double-report"" this guy? i'm sure he was given at least some consequence the first time around (if not fired) and wonder if some might argue that i was going too far or being vindictive by reporting him again. am i an asshole or a ""karen"" for not dropping this matter?",3
"my bf's mom wants his birthday dinner to be ""family only"", as in i'm not invited. am i wrong to feel a bit miffed?. i've been dating my bf for 3 years.  he turns 40 today.  with help from his mother....i threw him a surprise party this weekend.  his family, a few from my family and mutual friends.  the party was awesome.  now today is his actual birthday and last week his mom mentioned we would do family dinner on the night of his actual birthday.  i reached out to her and said we could do it at our place if that was easier since our place is a bit bigger then his moms house.  she said she would get back to me.

so my bf just let me know that tonight is ""family only"" at his moms house.  meaning myself and his sisters husband aren't invited.  just parents and the three kids (him, sister and brother).  i dunno...i feel a little offended?  we're shopping for engagement rings right now...so i will be family.  i thought i was family.  i'm not one to make a big deal over things but this feels like a bit of a power play since i was sorta in charge of the surprise party this weekend.  does this deserve some attention or just leave this one alone and let them have family time?

edit: some suggested i mention that there are different languages involved.  my bf and his brother speak fluent english and spanish, mom speaks spanish but very good english, dad speaks spanish but very little english, the sister speaks english, spanish to her dad and portuguese to her husband, the husband speaks portuguese, some spanish, broken english.  i'm the of bird out with just english a little spanish. when we go out all together (minus dad) we usually converse in english but mom will switch to spanish if she's tired or can't find the words to say something.  my bf will usually translate for me so i don't feel left out.  when dad is around it's primarily spanish and sometimes i get translations and sometimes i don't.  i can sometimes follow a conversation if the speech is slow enough but can't really answer beyond basic words in spanish.

update: i just got a call from my bf's mom.  apparently when she told him in spanish that the night would be family only he misunderstood thinking it was only the kids and parents.  she said she never meant that and was expecting the two of us.  my bf is getting a smack when he gets home. 🤦🏼‍♀️",7

"my wife's face has kept me from killing myself and she has no idea. since i was 16 years old i have wanted to end my life and have gotten very close on a few occasions. i got married at 21 to a woman i dated for about 7 months. i knew she was the one after the first date.

fast forward to now, 4 years later and i constantly think about ending my life. i will be driving and really consider driving off a cliff or into oncoming traffic or i get home from work and want to hang myself in the garage. i told her i sold my gun because i didn't have a practical use for it even though i did it so i wouldn't use it on myself.

i keep a picture of my wife in my wallet. it isn't a wedding picture or anything special it is just a normal picture of her outside of a movie theater i took when she wasn't paying attention. she is so beautiful and i love her 100 times more then i love myself and the thought of her having to go through me ending my life is enough to keep me from actually doing it. looking at her face makes me immediately reconsider it and always stops me from doing it.

i don't think i can ever tell her this and nobody knows i struggle with this so it feels really good to tell someone. even if they are strangers. thanks for reading and taylor if you read this somehow just know you are an incredible human being and i am in love with you

update 1: wow i am really amazed by all the responses i got. i just needed to put this somewhere and am overwhelmed with the amount of love and support i got. i have officially decided i am going to tell her tonight after work. i haven't really thought about what i am going to say but i will figure it out as i go. i don't think i have ever had this much support in my entire life, even if they are strangers and it helps a lot more then any of you probably think. i will post another update on what she says after i tell her this

update 2: i told her over the weekend although it took me until sunday to do it. she took it much better then expected although said it definitely blind sided her. she wants me to go to counseling with her and talk it out with someone. we are still discussing that, but when i thought this woman couldn't get any more amazing she comes out completely understanding and is staying by my side. i feel like the biggest weight has been lifted from my shoulders and i just want to thank all of you for giving me the courage to do what i should of done a long time ago.

"if i wanted to randomly find someone in an amusement park, would my odds of finding them be greater if i stood still or roamed around?. assumptions:

same walking speed for both parties

there is a time limit, because, as /u/kivishlorsithletmos pointed out, the odds are 100% assuming infinite time.

the other person is not looking for you. they are wandering around having the time of their life without you.

you could also assume that you and the other person are the only two people in the park to eliminate issues like others obstructing view etc.

"by kicking a chestnut, stopping traffic for an hour and getting cornered by a lynch mob. so obligatory this happened yesterday but i'm still traumatised as i've never really encountered confrontation on such a big scale.

so let me set the scene first. i live (and grew up) in a fairly densely populated city in europe that has a good amount of nature patches. the people are genuinely quite friendly and usually not too short-tempered unless strangers (a.k.a non-locals) are involved. the location of this fu was a pretty busy junction just down the road of my flat - think two car lanes, cycling lanes, and pedestrian crossing. anyway, it was just before rush hour, around 4 pm and the sun was grilling everyone in europe (climate change - yeiy) for the past 3 weeks.

i was strolling down the road towards the junction completely blanking my surrounding as i was trying to come up with the perfect dish to surprise my gf in the evening. picture that quiet guy just minding his own business, head down, focusing on every single step - yep that's me. suddenly, i bump my head into a rock - or so i initially thought. i look up. it was the largest man i've ever seen - about the size of the mountain from got. he looked like a bodybuilder on steroids with a side of extra muscle (let's call him arnie). i was startled for a second before i see his buddy (let's call him sly) who was quite a bit shorter but just as wide as he was tall - so still quite intimidating for an under-the-radar-guy like me. ""oi, watch where you are going"" i bellow (jk, obviously arnie did). so being super alpha and dominant i mumble ""sorry"" and move around them to continue my walk to the supermarket. ""i mean how the f\*\*\* was i meant to walk past them when they literally block the whole pavement standing next to each other."" i think and kick a chestnut out of frustration - metaphorically releasing and passing on all my problems. and oh boy that worked - somewhat. what happened next i could not have imagined in a thousand lifetimes. hey, i mean even with the current ai technology i doubt they would have been able to predict that outcome.

i see the chestnut flying roberto carlos style towards the junction (hell, i heard the crowd roaring) and imo it probably even broke the sound barrier. while the chestnut was still in flight i raise my hand in pride having reclaimed my manliness with this superb treasure of a shot. and i'm talking the eager-please-pick-me-keen-bean-susan from middle-school hand raise (no, susan mayonnaise is not an instrument).

suddenly everything kept coming down.

the chestnut flew past a motorcyclist (around 3 feet high) who must have registered some kind of movement in front of him and he immediately hit the break. remember how i said they had nature patches in the city? well, the city installed sprinklers to keep the grass hydrated and green, but they somehow have their own spirit and love releasing water into the most inconvenient directions.

you guessed it, despite almost 40°c there was a puddle the size of a small american town right there in front of the breaking motorcyclist. his breaking turns into sliding, into rotating, into falling and finally into that metal-to-asphalt-screeching halting. behind him, a red car doesn't manage to break in time but does a fast and the furious drift and slides past the motorcycle also coming to a halt in the middle of the crossing around 5 meters away from the motorcyclist. then my attention is caught by the opposing lane as the red car just cut off a blue car's path who does the same drift (thanks to the puddle) and ends up head-on with the bumper wrapped around the traffic light post. by a miracle of god (or chance for the atheists) the post was harder than a dick after a two-week dry period and withstood the incident without giving in. yet the ten or so pedestrians waiting behind it scattered away with two stumbling over each other and falling flat faced. what followed after this was the loudest concert of honking cars and screaming, followed by screeching breaks from all directions.

and then a split second of silence.

until i hear a majestic roaring that simba would be proud of: ""duuuuuuude, what the fuck!!!"", yup arnie and sly walk up behind me and instantly get the attention of about another ten surrounding pedestrians that just at that moment exited the supermarket next to me. they start to explain what they saw to the others ('me causing this accident on purpose and celebrating') and suddenly an elderly man (let's call him miyagi) grabbed my wrist with the iron grip of a cyberman.

at that moment my life flashed in front of my eyes. my future, my spotless criminal record, my clumsy soap handling skills and my virgin butt hole. i was not going to make it a single night in prison.

suddenly the commotion starts - picture a real madrid vs barcelona team vs. team fight - all traffic stops, everyone gets out of their cars and comes towards our little ensemble - shouting. i've never seen a crowd agree that fast on anything but within 30 seconds everyone was pointing at me with red faces, anger in their eyes and most of them looked like they were going to release their super saiyan form on me while i was still trying to flee miyagi's claws (i know, statistically not all of them could have been super saiyans but still). what i haven't mentioned yet is that i actually look fairly mixed-race and live in a very white neighbourhood - so within another 30 seconds many of the screams were more racist than incident related (immigration and progressive europe - yeiy). throughout i just kept silent and head down as about thirty people by now were surrounding me (still triangled by arnie, sly, and miyagi) so that my voice would have drowned anyway.

after about another 5 minutes which felt like an eternity the golden opportunity arrived. i think sly took some pity with me and signaled a countdown with his left hand so only i could see and pointed into his direction. i am no fighter but i took one class of wing chun back in high school and in a spark of genius it all came back to me that moment. 'trap the dragon's head, the tail bites - trap the tail, the head bites'. as sly got down to his last finger i do the kung fu twist with my arm, break miyagi's iron grip around my wrist and start dashing towards sly. for a split second i thought i'd run into a muscle wall for the second time this day but in the last moment, he moved his 300 lbs. out of a way with the swiftness of a ballerina (damn, i was impressed). and then the sprint of a lifetime started. i was powell, bolt, and blake at the same time. i ran like my butthole depended on it (well it kinda did). luckily the mob never bothered to stand behind arnie and sly cause they figured i'd never get past them, so i didn't actually have to tackle anyone on my escape (no potential assault charges - yeiy) and continued down the road. i see some people follow me (pretty sure they had no clue about the chestnut but they just thought i was somehow involved) so i kept running and i had a good 100 m head start. i was just in front of my apartment block when i had the second spark of genius of the day - there was no way i would show them where i lived, so i ran for another 10 min further than any man has run ever before (about 2 km) until i reached a park to lie down. i was pretty sure that i lost most people when i passed my flat (thank god for the heat) but i had to be sure.

i cool down and call my neighbour who's flat looks down on the junction. i told her the whole story (she's a super old family friend) and she couldn't believe i was the guy sprinting away (she was sunning on her terrace). turns out the motorcyclist got up without injury and the blue and red car drivers weren't harmed either. according to my neighbour the cops and ambulance were called and they took down the details of all drivers, moved the blue car and treated the two pedestrians for about an hour, while all traffic was stopped.

something i didn't realise from my pov was that a second mob formed simultaneously around the motorcyclist after the crash who blamed him for everything, cause it looked like he just couldn't drive… and guess what - he was a foreigner - so that box was checked. his insurance will probably cover everything (at least that's what my conscience tells me).

i haven't left my flat of fear being recognised at the supermarket, my gf was a bit pissed that i made frozen pizza, and i promised myself to never kick a chestnut again.

tl:dr kicked a chestnut, distracted a motorcyclist, got out of hand and caused a crash, got blamed by a lot of clueless people, escaped running

"by not understanding how sound travels. set the scene. it's 2017 i had been dating my high school crush for 3 months now, meeting up at parties, getting drunk, the usual for a 18 year old, one day we decide that its time to spend the night together in my parents' house, because, you know, 3 months is a ""serious relationship"" for an 18 year old. obviously, i had to do some prep before she came over. fairy lights along the bed posts (cause chicks love that…) tidy the room, change the bed sheets, apply a lil bit of lavender to the pillows, spray some nice cologne gotta smell fresh.

fast forward a few hours, it's about 11pm, we are in bed, nothing but fairly lights lighting up the room, love is in the air, super romantic, things get heated and before we know it we are on our way to pound town, bed is rocking giving the classic bed frame squeak, having the time of our lives.

so this went on almost every day for a year, she would come over, we would get down to business go to sleep, repeat. and i thought nothing of it. the only thing that i questioned was when my mum came up the stairs and passed me a bag full of condoms. me being innocent was like ""hmm why would i need these, mum? i don't have sex?"" she just said, ""okay they're there if you need them"" and walked out. anyway, that didn't rouse any suspicion.

now, mid-week, no one is in the house but myself and my girlfriend of a year and a bit. she sat down on the bed and it squeaked  a little bit, it had gotten worse over our year together and it made us think about how the sound might travel… now i live in a two-story house, i stay upstairs, and my mum and stepdad sleep directly below me on the ground floor. so, i send the girlfriend downstairs into my mums' bedroom and i jump on the bed making it squeak. she comes back upstairs with a horrified expression on her face, apparently the sound carries through the floor and is amplified by the hollow ceiling, acting like a big amplifier. so, my poor mother who has since bought an expensive pair of ear plugs has had to listen to my girlfriend and i going at it for the past year… i wasn't able to look my mum in the eye for a few weeks after and i think she might have understood why.

"by accidentally submitting a suicide note as my essay for english class. so this happened yesterday, and i've yet to see what the results of my stupidity are

it is important to know that i was suicidal a year or so ago. i still have depression and anxiety though. also, this is a high school, and my school takes mental health **very seriously**.

so for my english class, i required to write an essay responding to a prompt on the list of prompts my teacher gave me. i decided to do the ""3 stages of life"" one, but instead of the classic ""birth, life, and death"" stages, i made the stages of my life ""bliss, pain, unknown.""  for bliss i wrote about my childhood and how nice it was to be a lil kid. for pain, i write about how depressed i got during high school and how i wake up everyday and think about how badly i want to die. then for unknown, i wrote about how peaceful everything would probably be after i die. i said i was looking forward to my death too. once i finished, i submitted it online without even reading through the whole thing once because i was right up against the deadline for submission

so fast forward to me, in my english class, about to read this essay out loud in front of a few of my classmates because we were supposed to ""peer review"" each other's essays. i read mine, and realized that it low key sounds like a suicide note. the people in my peer review group were shocked, and they tried to talk me out of killing myself (i never said i would kill myself, and i have no intention of doing so, but i did say in the essay that i was looking forward to dying, and i guess that made them think imma kill myself)

so now im just sitting there thinking to myself ""shit i just read a suicide note to my classmates! please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone please don't tell anyone""

so now im pretty sure that my teacher's gonna read my essay and tell somebody about my mental health, or even worse, she might tell my parents

"update 2 tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto

original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9prn30/tenant_is_renting_out_my_apartment_on_airbnb/)

thank you all for the wonderful advice, especially the fact that i am allowed to elect someone by proxy to do a unit inspection. i am never going to rent out my room again because this has been a massive battle.

my friend to rent the room for a single night because my land lord never responded about doing a walkthrough in time, and i was nervous. turns out someone not jane, but someone who identified himself as janes coworker who works for company x, met my friend in the parking lot. he gave him the keys. i don't know who this person is but i am not comfortable with some random person having my apartment keys.

my friend ironically was rejected by the concierge service, who asked him what room he was going to. (i forgot to tell my property manager about this). my friend got a full refund from airbnb and him and his girlfriend were put up in a nice hotel a few blocks away by airbnb for the night.

my property manager did respond and was kind enough to do a video walkthrough with me on speaker phone, and honestly my apartment is not in great shape at all. apparently it stinks of cigarettes and weed, and there was a beer can being used as an ash tray, which is not allowed since our apartment building is ""smoke free"". i have stains/burns on my couch which looks like from cigarettes.

airbnb has not done anything, and her listing is still up (i can't find any other listings of hers).

jane however has been constantly sending me angry emails, about how i am impacting her financial situation, to how it is making her look bad as an airbnb host. i told her bluntly the things that i saw from the walkthrough and how it stinks of smoke and we are a smoke free building. she claims she never signed any sort of agreement about condo rules, and i sent her a picture of the agreement she signed, including the condo rules page.

i offered to let her out of the lease, and not pay any more rent money for the remainder of the time on the lease. skipping novemeber/december. if she left, and had the apartment cleaned. she on the other hand demanded $5,000 for her to vacate from the apartment early. when i refused she told me ""i will do everything within my power to make ur life a living hell for fucking with me"".

my lawyer has made the complaint with the ltb, and he thinks it will most likely be resolved by the end of december. this has taught me a hard lesson, and i will never rent my apartment again.

anyways thanks for the advice.",2

thank you in advance. 

edit: really interesting answers by everyone so far. thank you!

 here is a different news source(https://www.yahoo.com/amphtml/tech/extinct-creature-sightings-piling-australia-130041464.html) which i read a couple days ago that prompted me to think that the number of sightings have increased recently. 

in the article they mention several recent sightings and the fact that there is a team of scientists taking action to further investigate the claims.

more information on the scientists conducting the research can be found here(https://www.jcu.edu.au/news/releases/2017/march/fnq-search-for-the-tasmanian-tiger) in a media release from james cook university. dr. sandra abell and professor bill laurence will be leading a team of scientists that will be placing 50 wildlife cameras out in strategic locations to try to catch a glimpse of the creature. this is part of an already existing study that they were conducting to monitor wildlife that had been modified to focus on the tasmanian tigers following the credible sighting reports.

"my immigrant, deaf father was choked, body-slammed, arrested and had his sentry card taken away at the border for failing to comply to an audible demand. i want a copy of the video and his sentry card back.. edit:
the title of this post inaccurately states my father was body-slammed. after a carefully talking to the family members present i realized this was not the case. the rest of this post remains unchanged.

a little background: 

my entire family and i are naturalized citizens from mexico. we were all born and raised in mexico and we tend to visit a lot of family and friends on an almost daily matter. we live in san diego and in order to avoid hours of waiting at the border, we applied for and received sentry cards(https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/sentri/how-apply-sentri). we are hard-working people, engineers, educators, pay our taxes, etc...

my father was crossing back across the border into the us in one of the sentry lanes during labor day at around 7 pm. my father was driving, my mother in the passenger seat, and my pregnant sister-in-law and my niece were in the back of the car. according to the accounts of my family, there were two border patrol officers on the passenger side checking sentry cards before the actual booth. one of the officers made a hand signal in the shape of a license, implying that my dad flash the sentry cards, which he did - but the officer did not see it. the officer starts walking in front of the vehicle towards the driver side door while making the same motion and yelling something out which my father does not make out (he is deaf). he starts banging on the drivers side door. my father once again flashes the sentry cards and says ""here it is!"". 

my family says that the officer did not like the tone my father was using and said ""ok. i'm gonna get your sentry card taken away"". my father opens the car door, confused and interpreting the banging on it as the officer asking to open it up. the officer then proceeds to choke my dad, drag him out of the car and handcuff him. my mother tried to explain that my father was deaf and wasn't understanding what the officer wanted. he replied with ""i don't care"".

afterwards, my father was taken to a processing facility and released without any charges - except the officer was successful in taking his sentry card.

for obvious reasons this angers me - it really complicates our way of life here in a border city. i'd like to recover my dads sentry card.

i also would like to acquire video of the situation if possible. border crossings are high-security environments and i know there must be video of the incident in possession by the bp officers. how would i go about getting video of the incident?",2
"my first daughter isn't mine biologically and nobody in my family knows. i'm sorry but this is a long read. while i was in college i was paired with a very peculiar roomate. she didn't talk to me much and would always be away, she was very clean and organized and i thanked the heavens for it because all my friends complained about their roomates and i had gotten lucky.

jump to two years later, she comes up to me to say that she's pregnant and may need some help from me. i asked who was the father but she said it was a random guy she hooked up with and she couldn't even find him anymore. when i asked about her family she said that she didn't have one, her entire family was dead and she had been on foster homes most of her life and only got out because she wasn't underage anymore.

after that talk she didn't say anything else. i noticed that she had strange patterns, she would wake up and leave super early and get back super late. the only times she asked me for my help while pregnant was when she went to discover the sex of the baby and to accompany her to one appointment who was a bit away from campus.

even then we didn't talk much. she kept her routine and i kept mine. sure she was pregnant but she acted like she wasn't and to be honest there wasn't much i could do anyway. she didn't slow down even when she got near her the end of the pregnancy and i'm sure this played a huge part on how things ended.

she was 7 months pregnant and asked me to take her to the doctor because she was feeling a lot of pain. she was weird during the entire ride, talking nonsense. she said she wanted me to care for the baby and to never tell the baby about her. at this point i was freaking out, this wasn't supposed to happen, so i was just agreeing to whatever she was saying.

when we got to the hospital they took her straight to be examined and later to have a c-section. apparently she had preeclampsia and her placenta was detached. at this point i called a few friends of mine because i was freaking out. the doctors gave me some medicine because my blood pressure was very high and i was having a panic attack. i don't remember that part but that's what they told my friends when they got there. 

later i learned that my roomate had died because of the birth but the kid was alive. they said that they had found a note on her belongings saying that i was the one who was supposed to care for the kid because she had no one else and didn't want her daughter to be raised by strangers like she was. 

i was so confused at the time, they said they would have to contact child services and i would have to file for adoption. this was at a weird time or maybe the city was just messed up, because they only checked my background and if i had a job and a place to fall back on and that was that. they just gave me a baby and didn't think twice about it because apparently the note that the roomate had left was a big thing and should be taken into account.

they gave me the note to read and i wasn't supposed to ever tell the kid about her real mom. after a lot of time thinking i came up with the idea to investigate her alongside my friends, which wasn't much since we were a bunch of idiots in college with not a lot of money. we could only find out that she was a sex worker and that nobody knew her much around college aside from a girl who was also a sex worker and gave us the info.

my friends told me to make up a pregnancy and have my parents care for the kid while i was in college. i'm not sure my parents ever bought the whole story but they did love the kid and accepted to care for her. the story was basically me getting pregnant on accident and not telling them because i was ashamed but coming back around because i realized that i needed help.

19 years later i'm married with two kids who are mine and my daughter who is mine but not by blood. i love all of them equally, i learned a lot after i graduated and had to care for her with the help of my parents. she is a bright kid and looks a lot like her mother, which makes me sad sometimes. she even says that we don't look alike and i tell her she took after her ""father"". i really wish i could tell her the truth. i feel so bad not doing it. i don't want her mother to be forgotten, especially by her own daughter.

"by not washing my hair properly for over 10 years. i have not clue when this fu started but i do know that i realised my error at the age of around 25, i'm currently 34.

i was recently reminded of this after seeing this particular image(https://preview.redd.it/k4wt3q2b25a31.jpg?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=27404351cf1bfa999bd9d068776855a4230687da) on another subreddit.


backstory:


like most children, i was bathed by my parents up until an age where they felt i was getting to old to have them help me, around 9, 10,11, or 12 (for a guess, god knows). i remember that both parents had taught me the importance of cleaning everywhere efficiently. i used to hate it when my father washed my hair. he used to scrub it so hard that it would shake my head and i could feel each of his fingers digging into my scalp when he did it.


after i was old enough to wash myself, as well as the usual instructions of what to make sure i had washed, he always told me to give my head a good scrub. it's only after realising my fu that i recalled my fathers instructions from all those years ago.

i can only presume that once i had the ability and trust to clean myself, i choose to ignore my fathers advice about washing the shampoo in deep and hard with my fingers. for many years i would use shampoo and just rub in onto my hair with the palms of my hands for an amount of time that i thought sufficient before washing it off again.

i'm half white and half black and although my hair has always been fairly short, it has an tough afro texture. i could be stood in the shower for an hour with water pouring on my head and the hair would remain sticking up. i'm not sure whether this was a factor or not but i could never style my hair in any way. so it wouldn't need combing when i got out of bed or out of the shower, it just stayed upright constantly and it still does.


for as long as i remembered every time i went to the barbers i would notice a huge about of what i thought was dry skin falling all over the black gown. i used to be so embarrassed about this and constantly tell the barbers that i had a dry scalp condition. i ever purchased special shampoo to treat dry scalp but nothing helped.


i couple of times a barber would tell me that i needed to clean my head properly. i just presumed that they didn't understand a dry scalp when they saw one. before going to the barbers i would have long showers washing my hair for ages but nothing helped, 30 mins later i would be in the barbers chair with white flasked falling all over the place.


one time it was so bad that about five people in the barbers made comments about the amount of flakes scattered all about me during a cut. i was a little embarrassed but just told them all about my dry scalp condition. at the end of this particular cut i looked like i had been out in the snow for an hour.


so the realisation came one day when i was around 24/25 and i was washing my ears. other than a five second rinse around with my fingers, i never really put much thought into cleaning the inside of my ears. i don't know why but on this occasion i decided to put shampoo inside my ears. i washed around for a while and after a few seconds i start to hear/feel my fingers squeaking, having washed away any oil that was there.


i suddenly thought of the phrase 'squeaky clean', and it all of a sudden dawned on me. memories of my father hurting my head with his fingers came back to me. i had never heard or felt my head squeak in this way since i was a kid.


i quickly emptied a load of shampoo on my hair and instead of using my palms i dug in my fingers (hard) and started scrubbing. after a while on a certain spot i heard/felt a squeak.


omg! right there and then i quickly realised that i didn't have a dry scalp condition, i had just not properly cleaned my hair for all of these years. i washed the whole of my head until all of it squeaked.


i've made sure to clean to the squeak each time since. on the next trip to the barbers there was not a single white flake anywhere and there hasn't been one since.


i told the barber the doctor had given me some medication which has fixed my problem so that i didn't have to confess to being a dirty, dumb idiot. i will make sure my son never has to go though this by telling him my story.


tl/dr

for ten years i thought that i was covering the barbers gowns in white flakes because i had a dry scalp problem. it turned out that i just didn't know how to wash my hair properly.

"for asking my wife for an abortion.. me (31m) & my wife (29f) are very vehemently childfree. we're not one of those nutters who calls kids crotch fruit or spawn or whatever godforsaken name there is, but it was an agreement that we had very early in the relationship that we wouldn't have kids.

now i've been putting off getting a vasectomy, i did get one a few weeks ago but i was just procrastinating it which was my fault i guess. however i used condoms and my wife has been on birth control since she was 14, so we were all good. so about 2 weeks before the vasectomy, me and the wife were getting down to business and i realized that i'd ran out of condoms, she reminded me that she's on birth control so we proceeded with the deed. i go get some
more condoms after, vasectomy happens, and  everything's all good.

nope. she's now six weeks pregnant, i was surprised cause isn't she supposed to be on birth control? come to find out that she hasn't been taking it for at least a few months now. on top of that, she wants to keep the kid which i am very against, she's very fucking ecstatic which shocked me cause obviously she's against having kids too. i feel so damn betrayed in this situation, she knows i'm very against kids and not only that but i was a foster child and don't know anything about my parents so i have no clue what inheritable diseases i may have. 

i really don't want to have a kid. so much so that i'm thinking of divorcing her if she's not willing to get rid of it, and to be honest i might divorce her anyways cause of the crap she pulled with the birth control. 

i have told her that i'm against this pregnancy but i haven't pushed any further than that. would i be the asshole for possibly divorcing her over this, or asking her to get an abortion?",3

"not caring about or accommodating for my roommate's girlfriend's baby. i (27f) and my roommate (23m) rent from our landlord (60m) and are both on the lease. recently my roommate started dating a woman (19f) with a kid (toddler). 

both the woman and the kid are really annoying. i'm childfree and dislike being around children. this annoying toddler always screams and throws tantrums. i could deal with this until now. roommate's girlfriend decided it was ok for her to move in without paying rent since she got kicked out of her parents house (wonder why?). i am very vocally not happy with this and i told the landlord immediately and he said he'd do something about it but never did. it's been a month so i'm not even sure if she can be legally evicted now, not that it's even in my hands now.

best thing i can do now is just ignore the girlfriend and her kid. i don't acknowledge the kid, i bought a minifridge for my room so that she doesn't steal my food, i moved my tv and all my consoles from the living room into my room since i hate going out there now anyway. apart from that business is completely normal. i smoke weed (legal, not against the lease so long as i do it on the balcony), have people over including my girlfriend who i have sex with, practice my instruments as loud as i want during non-quiet hours. i refuse to babysit for any amount of time for any reason. one time i was sleeping and got woken up to my door being knocked on and my phone vibrating. i saw a bunch of texts from roommate saying that they need me to babysit. i lied and said i was out which lead to them having to cancel their plans for the day.

roommate's girlfriend hates me and thinks i'm being selfish. thinks that the baby needs to come first. she has no money and my roommate makes a lot less than me so she thinks i should be responsible for childproofing the house. i told her to take it up with the landlord and that i wasn't wasting my money on her and her kid that isn't even wanted here.

today i was having my lunch with my mom and vented about this to her and she said that i'm being really mean because even though the circumstances aren't ideal ""babys should come first, always"". am i really the asshole for wanting to live my life exactly the same as before some unwanted kid started squatting in my house? the way i see it she should go find some other place or if she can't afford one a shelter somewhere.",3
"for telling my friend's husband about her secret food stash?. background: i have this friend mandy who i guess what you'd call ""militantly obese."" she has claimed in the past that it's a civil rights issue and that she is ""genetically fat"" just like people are ""genetically black"" (her words, not mind but you can see her mindset). 

recently mandy's husband said enough is enough is enough and told her that if she didn't at least make and effort to change he was leaving. mandy was diagnosed with being pre-diabetic and called me sobbing both because of what her husband said and the doctor being ""anofher link in the chain."" 

this was about january and mandy and her husband have been on a calorie restricted diet and he has lost...probably 20lbs and mandy has actually gained weight. mandy was using this as ""proof"" that her issue was genetic. 

i was helping mandy unload groceries the other day and came across a huge tupperware bin the back of her suv. i assumed she wanted it unloaded but as i moved it, the lid came loose and it was packed to the gills with treats, most opened and half eaten. i asked her about it. she got super defensive and told me to mind my own business. i asked her if this why she's gaining weight. she told me to fuck off. i texted her husband because in the heat of the moment i was furious she had spoken to me like that.

her husband has filed for emergency seperatrion so mandy can't ruin him financially (she has threatened this in the past) with the aim of divorce. mandy is blaming me, am i the asshole here?


edit: i accept my judgment and i won't delete but the comments have taken a ridiculous turn and i don't want to he part of this anymore. no i don't want to have sex with him. nor did i ever imply or infer that. enjoy your day.


edit 2: based on some responses that said i was the asshole for acting out of anger rather than concern (which i accept) i called and told mandy that i was sorry for my reasons for texting her husband. she said that i am just another person oppressing her and that even the avengers were oppressing her these days. i asked her what she meant (won't spoil the movie) but i explained to her that i was acting out of frustration and avengers is just a movie and now i was really concerned. she said i could take my concern and shove it up my ass and we're done and hung up and has apparently blocked my number. thank you for participating but i think it's a dead subject at this point. i hope she gets the help she needs",3

"i convinced my parents to get a divorce. so my parents had been ""married"" for 18 years before they got divorced back in 2012. i was 15 or 16 at the time.

i put ""married"" in quotes because even though the purpose of getting married is to basically solidify your love with someone, they were definitely not in love. at least, not anymore.

i remember my parents getting along well when i was young (around 3) but a few years  after my brother was born, things took a turn for the worst.

they were constantly at each other's throats. they would argue with each other every. single. night. my brother and i were terrified that something bad would happen during these arguments.

then, when they weren't arguing with each other, they were taking their anger out on us. my dad was just abusive and would go out of his way to find reasons to beat my brother and i with coat hangers until they broke.

and my mom was just reacting to the frustration. she would sometimes smack us, but that was the extent of it.

eventually, at the age of 15,  i decided that i had had enough. i was sick of all of this physical and emotional abuse. everyone in the household was hurting.

so i suggested divorce to my parents and talked about it constantly when the other parent wasn't around.

so eventually my ""manipulation"" worked and they got divorced. and honestly? it was the most liberating feeling ever. 

i don't know if i was in the right for doing this; i sometimes feel like a manipulative bitch when i think back to it. but overall my mom, my brother, and myself all seem like we've thrived without the constant presence of my dad.

"i (17f) went to my school counselor about all the nasty stuff my stepfather (50m) does. it's caused chaos at home. 
my mom and dad divorced a few years ago, and now my mom is dating zach. it was really stressful when he moved into the house with us, he's bossy and gets pissed off easy.

i started keeping a diary to vent, and every day i'd write in it and talk about what was going on in my life. it helped me cool down and relax when i was upset.

a few weeks ago, stuff got really stressful at home and i decided to put together a list of stuff that upset me and go to the school counselor for advice. i wasn't expecting her to get very involved, i just wanted to talk to someone. my best friend has talked to her about coping with her mom's death and she said she was very kind and helpful.

so i went to the counselor and i'd made a list of the things that zach did that made me angry, because i wanted to be prepared to talk. i tend to clam up if i have to talk about personal things, and i didn't want that to happen.

so i brought this list that i'll copy here:

- zach yells easily if he doesn't get his way. at me, at other people like the applebee's waitress, the cashier at the walmart, etc.

- zach is big on ""making up"" even when i'm not ready; he will make me hug him even if i'm still mad, because he's over being mad and wants to make things better.. even though it doesn't work that way

- zach doesn't respect my privacy, he want though my drawers and got mad because i had panties that he thought were ""too sl*tty"". i've got to hide my diary outside the house because i don't trust him to not read it.

- zach is judgemental of my friends, how much money their families have or don't have. he says mean stuff about their families, like how (name's) momma is on meth

- zach tried to go though my phone, look at personal texts with a boy i was dating, but luckily my phone was at 1 percent and died and i hid my charger

- zach is an aggressive driver and i won't go in his car

anyway, i told my school counselor all of that and i could tell she was very concerned. she asked about my diary, and i said i had more detail about all of this in my diary, i'd show her those pages if she wanted.

showing her the diary was easier than talking for me. so i was happy to.

and after that, things went down hill. it seems like the councilor has the impression stuff is sexually motivated, but that's not how it is. and she's filed a report with cps, she said she had no choice because that's a law.

when i was at home and zach was yelling at me about something, i let it slip what i'd done. i told him to shut up because cps was coming soon and he shouldn't be adding to the list of nasty stuff he'd said.

he got even madder and is planning on going to the school today to confront the principal. i'm not sure what will happen. plus there's still the thing that the councilor seemed to misinterpret.. what can i do?

"after college, once you get the first job, start looking for a better job after a year or two. don't stay out of loyalty.. because trust me, no company is loyal to their employees. be respectful and professional, but loyalty in a company is rarely noticed and appreciated - unless maybe if its your dad's company.


as a person who has worked for a same company for 6 years after graduating, i found out i didn't get a single raise within it unless i ask for it every fucking year, never got much other benefit than initially signed while studying at school.


so i started applying for 5 months and finally got a job, it pays me almost 5 (edit: 4 is more accurate+ benefits such as health care, lunch, gym etc...) times as much as i used to. my friend from same school, with same seniority was getting 4 times my salary for the last 2 years already.


my mistake was thinking that being loyal to this company was gonna in return make the company loyal to me, the company only wants lower costs, loyalty has no place here.

"saving tip: try to have 2 $0 spent days per week. a little trick that has really helped my wife and i spend less money is to try and have two days per week where we don't spend a single dollar. 

and it's actually a lot easier than you might think once you get used to it.

it really forces you to pack your own lunch, make a pot of coffee at home and avoid all those little (and unnecessary) expenditures that add up over course of a month. as a bonus, by forcing yourself to forego the pack of gum, diet coke and whatnot on your $0 days, you wind up cutting these things out naturally on the other days.

edit: just to address those who say this is nothing more than creative accounting that doesn't save you any money, there are dozens of types of expenses that we wouldn't ""make up"" on other days. 

if you don't buy a latte on tuesday and thursday because these are your no-spend days, you're unlikely to buy two on wednesday and friday to double-down and you're equally unlikely to buy an extra one the day before to sit in your car and wait for you.

and if you try and ""cheat"" by buying a case of diet coke and box of gum ahead of time, you're still saving a ton of money by buying in bulk. the cost of 24 cans of diet coke at the supermarket is the same as 5 from the machine at the office.

if you pass on that clever t-shirt you happen across but had no intention of buying you are unlikely to drive back the next day to get it on a ""spending day.""

you won't drink twice as much the next night because you passed on going to the pub after work with your mates on a non-spending day and you won't see two movies instead of one and on and on and on.

on top of all that, just getting into the mindset that it's possible to go a full day without spending a dollar starts the habit of watching how you spend every day.

clearly not every trick works for everyone and clearly if you're taking home a couple grand per week such a tip might be silly - but in our experience it absolutely helps.

edit 2: man...i love reddit, hahaha. some of the comments here are pure gold (no pun intended). yeah...i get it. some people are poor and don't make as much money as they'd like/need...but this is a totally separate issue. the reality is that, for all our bitching, most people in the first world do, in fact, earn enough money to have some sort of discretionary spending. sure, if you already have 4-5 days a week with $0 to spend this advice won't be relevant...but this is a totally unrelated issue.

and on the other shoe...yeah, i also get that some people earn so much money that saving a few grand a year on snacks, whizbangs and doodads won't make a real difference....but the majority of people don't earn six-figures and the majority of people do spend more than they truly need to in order to be happy.

at any rate...i had no idea this was going to blow up so big - it just kind of popped into my head this morning as i was drinking my coffee how big of a difference it's made for us to do this (it's been about 7 years now that we've more or less followed this pattern.)

"i drugged a co-worker and he can't tell anyone. i (legally) take a stimulant for a medical issue. i'm very open about my mental health and medication with co-workers and friends because i believe it's the only way to help others seek help for themselves sometimes. now with saying that, there are always people who are nefariously trying to convince me to give them a pill or two because ""what if it helps them"". i always tell them to talk to their doctor if they truly believe they have a disorder.

so there is one co-worker of mine who (not so subtly) jokes about me handing him some of my medication at work every now and then. i've always shut him down in a joking way, but we both know neither of us are actually joking. it's never really been a huge problem, just slightly annoying, and i didn't think much of it until last week. from here on i'll refer to this co-worker as w.

now, i usually keep my things out in my car since i don't have an office or locker to safely store them. this one particular day though, it was getting pretty hot outside (yay for summer) and i had complained to a few co-workers at lunch about my laptop possibly overheating in my car. everyone else agreed it was shitty of management to not provide lockers and we all laughed it off. everyone except w.

w kinda piped up amidst the discussion and said ""you know, you can totally put your stuff in my office if you'd like, you know, so your computer is safe."" i thanked him and continued on my way. it didn't really occur to me at that time that he had any other motive other than being nice.

about an hour later, w saw me in passing and said, ""hey! i thought you were going to store your things in my office?"" it was at that moment i started seeing the big picture. so i smiled and agreed, ""yup! sorry, i just got busy! i'll go grab my bag and bring it up in a minute!""

so i went to my car, gathered my things and kinda sat there for a second in the sweltering heat of my car thinking. i would never accuse someone of stealing and generally expect the best out of people at my workplace, but it didn't sit right with me that w brought the whole situation up again and hour later when i had just made a quick comment that one time. i decided to take my meds out of my bag and store them in the center console. well, i took the stimulants out. what most people don't know is that i'm also prescribed an anti-anxiety medication, but i don't usually talk about it because i rarely take it. it mostly makes me sleepy and doesn't help throughout the day, only at night on rare occasions. the pills also look very similar to my stimulants. i kept that bottle in the bag.

for clarification, i did not switch pills or bottles, the anti-anxiety meds clearly state what it is. i did, however, have a sneaking suspicion that w had something in mind other than allowing me to safely store my belongings in his office, and was curious if he'd actually try to take one.

i ended up putting my stuff down in his office (he looked almost too happy to help), thanked him again and went about my business. maybe another hour later i returned to grab something from my bag and w had a look on his face that screamed i fucked up. he mentioned that he was not feeling well and his eyes were kinda droopy. he went home early that day.

now i know it was kinda fucked up of me to bait him like i did, but if he was a smart thief, he'd have read the bottle. and if he was a good person, he wouldn't have touched my shit in the first place. i counted the pills when i got home and sure enough 2 were missing. two pills. just one of those bad boys puts me on my ass. i have no idea if he took one and saved one or if he took both, but i know the look of sedation when i see it.

in the end, w was fine. he came to work the next day looking guilty af and mostly avoided me. we both know what he did, but he can't say anything without confessing to stealing my medication. all in all, i feel like he might have learned his lesson, though i do feel bad for setting it up. he hasn't said a word about my meds this week and i still don't have somewhere safe to put my things this summer, but i'm sure w got a fan-fucking-tastic nights sleep that day.",11

"dying of a mysterious lung disease; military hospital is putting me on months-long waiting lists just to see my pcm for referrals and preventing me from going to civilian doctors.. title is tl;dr.

went on a deployment to guam and contracted something that's killed my pulmonary health: it hurts to breathe, i occasionally cough up blood either after waking up or exercising, i can't even go up a flight of stairs or walk for more than 20 minutes without turning into a dying fish gulping air. i was given an albuterol inhaler and that's it medication-wise.

was screened for cancer and tb, both results came back negative, was unable  to get further testing done in guam due to lack of accommodations at their hospital, am currently back in mainland us but the navy's making it a fight to even see my primary doctor just to *get a referral* to see a cardiologist, radiologist and pulmonologist for follow-up testing. 

every day i'm getting worse and i've been told i'm straight-up not allowed to go to a hospital or doctor outside of the military to get help, lest i face punitive measures in addition to having to pay out of pocket. 

what can i do? who can i talk to? i've basically been told: unless you're actually on your deathbed, you're screwed. i'm trapped in endless diagnostics, recieving no actual care, operating at the speed of bureaucracy and i'm slowly dying.

edit: went to the er, complained  about the chest pain, worked like a charm. i've got a follow up appointment tomorrow and got all the referrals needed to book appointments at all the specialty clinics.

edit 2: i appreciate all the advice and good will. 

for the guys pming medical advice: it's not pneumonia or bronchitis or anything acute: was screened for those as well, symptoms have been ongoing for almost a year now from onset of symptoms. it's also only a *little* blood, like  the amount you'd get from a paper cut. still sucks and it's pretty alarming when it happens.

given the sheer amount of people recommending the same thing, i'll address it here instead of individually: 

i'll be following up with either patient advocacy services for further appointments and bring up the difficulty i've been having with my coc.

"for getting annoyed with the a guy playing his guitar in a coffee shop?. i was sitting at a table in a coffee shop yesterday when this guy comes in to the shop carrying a guitar and orders a drink. he then happens to choose the space right next to my table to stand and play his guitar while waiting for his order. 

i find people who force their music on others very annoying. this guy and his guitar are no different from someone playing music from a bluetooth speaker in a public area in my mind. but i was lucky in this case - i didn't have to stick around. without speaking to the guy or even making eye contact, i stood up and moved to the complete opposite side of the shop to a new table by the exit. 

well the guy must have noticed my displeasure because he stopped playing after i moved. a few moments later he got his drink and moved towards the exit to leave. he opens the door to leave, pauses, then turns to me and says ""you could have just asked me to stop playing. treat me like a human being."" and then continued out the door before i could respond. 

so this guy is acting like i'm the asshole for not verbally engaging with a stranger who annoyed me. i feel like simply removing myself from the area when possible is usually the right play and leads to less conflict. aita?",3
"i spent several years hiding sugar packets in my colleagues pockets.. at my last job i spent several years hiding sugar packets in my colleagues coat pockets. it started with just one colleague that i enjoyed winding up in good humour, but i didn't want it to be obvious that it was me. so i scaled up.

our coffee making facilities and coat stand were isolated from the main office, there were no cameras and some double doors that always provided warning of interruptions (some sort of air pressure movement would make the other jolt when one was opened). so i was never caught or worried someone might walk in and think i was stealing.

i must of done it twice a week for maybe three years and i'd pick random or decorative coat pockets. the type that people never really use. this was in order to maximise the confusion and unusual times the sugar packets would be discovered. i had maybe 40 colleagues and would make every effort to alternate targets. 

in this way i hoped none would ever tell another colleague that once every few months they randomly fact found sugar packets. who would??? your colleagues would think you were weird right!?

anyway, i particularly enjoyed putting them in the ceo's coat. he was a nice guy, but a bit disorganised and scatty. 

no one ever mentioned it to me, so i guess it worked, but i guess it also stopped when i left. so maybe they figured it out.

"for suggesting that my trans friend wear a towel at a japanese sauna?. i am a 20 y/o girl. i am in japan on exchange with some friends of mine. most of my friend group are women, including a 21 y/o trans woman. she was born a male and started transitioning in her teens. currently she is pre-op and saving up for gender reassignment surgery. however, you can hardly tell that she used to be a male, save for her voice and height/body frame.

anyways, yesterday night, a bunch of girls (5 or so) from my classes decided to go to a nearby onsen, or japanese bath house. basically, you are expected to get completely naked. everything is gender segregated. there is a separate men's section and women's section.

my friend who is trans also wanted to go. so we all went as a group. everyone in our group knows that she is trans and pre-op, but i think everyone was uncomfortable talking about the issue of being naked in the bath house. finally, when we were in the changing rooms, i quietly suggested to her that she should probably wrap a towel around her hips instead of going completely naked.

she asked me why and i told her that many of the bathers would probably be a bit alarmed to see male genitalia in the bath house. she got mad at me and said sarcastically, ""thanks for your concern."" in the end she opted for the towel, but another friend overheard and said i was out of line for suggesting it. they both thought it was none of my business. i explained that not everyone is so accepting of her body and that i'm just trying to protect her from comments, stares, or worse.

they avoided me in the bath house after that although my friend did wear a towel around her waist the whole time. there were some looks but not as bad as if she didn't wear a towel.

i apologized afterwards to my trans friend and said i meant no disrespect. but she still seemed mad at me and are telling people that i am transphobic, although i do not believe that i am. aita?",3

"by almost getting my brother kicked out of my parents house over thermal paste. obligatory this was a few years ago.

i work in the it field, and have always been handy with computers.
growing up, when i lived in my parents house, i did computer repair here and there, and often had many computer parts and accessories with me.
when i left my parents house, i ended up leaving a few things behind in my room.

my brother was still living with my parents at the time, and he has been known to dabble in illegal activities. so my mom is already on the paranoid side of things.

fast forward about 2 years, and i get a frantic (frantic) call from my mom.

ok, is any writing on it? does it have a needle?

ok, well whats the company name? and did you google it?

""it says thermaltek on the side. and when i went to google it, all it came up with was computer parts! i know you don't use syringes for computers!!!""

ok, so let's walk through this together ok?

1. you found said syringe and he said it was for a computer, and it was mine
2. you googled the company name and all you found were computer parts
3. you found it in my room
4. you know i work on computers
5. and there was no needles

"about that $5 cup of coffee. in the world of personal finance, i often encounter people talking about that daily trip to starbuck's, to buy that $5 cup of coffee as an example of an easy overindulgence to cut. and it's totally true--if you're spending $5 on a cup of coffee every single day, that's $35 a week, or like $150 a month. for a lot of us a $150 monthly bill would easily be in the top ten recurring expenses, if not higher. and sure, that's an easy thing to cut out if we're trying to slim down, right? 

all totally correct. however, i think we can sometimes get a little too overzealous in our drive to frugality. to me, the point of managing your expenses on a daily basis isn't simply to get them as low as possible, but to actually think about what's important to you and what's worth it. the point of managing your money is to figure out what you care about, and what you can afford, and to be able to allow yourself to do the things you want to do without stressing about whether you'll be crushed under a mountain of debt if you do. 

personally, i love going to coffee shops. i love chit chatting with the barrista while they make my coffee. i love getting out of the house, i love reading the paper or surfing the web while i sip coffee that someone else has made for me in an environment that's carefully curated to be beautiful and welcoming. that's easily worth $5 a day to me. 

the overall point being: when it comes to your daily budget, i don't think there's ever a one-size-fits-all rule. it's more about what's important to you in life, and what tradeoffs you're willing to accept. 

now, i'm gonna go head out to a coffee shop for a little bit. ",10

"update: my neighbors caused themselves to be landlocked, i posted here, it's resolved now. i posted here for advice a while back and received some excellent, some funny and some conflicting advice from all of you.  the overwhelming advice was to get a lawyer, which i did. i explained the situation and that i had posted here, as well as the many topics you all prompted me to read up on (which was very helpful).  while my lawyer seemed pleased with your advice to me, he also urged me to immediately stop publicly posting about the situation, which i did (and which i see from my many messages has disappointed all of you!)

first thing's first: everything worked out in my favor.

my wife was upset by the entire situation and especially concerned with our children, and she got involved as well.  she spoke with some friends who were able to get her in touch with the local city council. they could not explicitly do anything direct to help us but did get us in touch with some of the right people to discuss our situation.

one of the most important results from those connections was learning that the ""sheriff"" who we spoke to was actually a deputy who was acting on the sheriff's behalf. we were able to meet with the actual sheriff.  he did agree that we should be more open to compromise but was much more willing to admit that we had no immediate legal reason to do so, and no interest in forcing us to.

my lawyer made a key point of the fact (i use the term loosely) that if the neighbors require an easement to access their land, they should so so with the land they sold, and not with unrelated land. after a lot of back and forth (but no court proceedings, luckily) with the other party, their attention was refocused on the buyer of their land. funny enough, it's a small world and i ended up meeting the buyer who was in my lawyer's office for a consultation with one of his partner's. he ended up needing to get a different lawyer (since i already had a lawyer from the firm, as i understand it) but we did keep in contact to some extent.

now, some speculation: we believe that the reason the neighbors didn't bother us for a while was their finances; their lawyer was happy to keep pushing as long as he was getting paid, but when money ran dry he lost interest. 

due (we believe) to those financial problems as well as their inability to find a quick solution, the neighbors ultimately moved into town and lived with family there for several months. the neighbor on the other side gave them one-time access with a moving truck. their lawyer had been showing up with them but was gone at that time, which is another reason i suspect major money issues.

in the fall the situation picked up again, with contact from a new lawyer this time. this new lawyer requested a meeting with us (and our lawyer, of course). he requested that we consider buying their property to resolve the issue. we initially said no, they offered it to the owner on the other side, they said no, they sweetened the pot. eventually the price was right and my wife and i had developed an interest in more land. we discussed terms, then decided against it, they went a little cheaper again, we purchased their land.

i nearly posted an update once the purchase was complete but there was an additional interesting detail that came out of the woodwork, and brought new legal questions. the neighbors had used their land and home as collateral for an informal loan and the person who lent to them wanted the property when they failed to repay him. he came after us.  the outcome of this was that they are the ones who failed their end of the contract, so his problem was with the neighbors, not with us.  this is definitely a sideline from the original situation but caused a delay in my ability to update.

as of today, my wife and i are out a substantial amount of money due to legal fees, which it turned out was not worth going after from the neighbors. there is also bad news in that the home on that property was essentially worth even less than we thought, and there were major issues beyond the land itself (septic tank failure, leaking oil tank).  those expenses were slightly mitigated by insurance but we are out a good some.

we also had a hard time combining the plots, which was legally desirable to build anything that straddled the two property lines. however the plots are now combined into one large plot.

the good is that the neighbors are no longer an issue for us, and by this summer their property should be in good shape to use for a new project of our own. on one hand, i will say this: the little chunk of land was definitely not worth the time and stress involved in this process, nor the money. however, the outcome was positive for our family (for which there is no dollar value) and it's all over with now.

my sincere thanks to everyone who offered advice.  there are far too many of you to thank individually, but please know that i appreciated everyone's contributions and i hope you're all still around to read my much delayed resolution.",2
"i am left freezing cold in my apartment - as i pay more than 4x the monthly hydro bill of my neighbor. in june of this year i moved into a one bedroom apartment in ontario, canada. my hydro bills were exceptionally high since moving in (averaging $300-$400 cad per month). *i am a student - and cannot afford these ridiculously high prices!*

* i am extremely cautious about using electricity because of these high bills, so i rarely use the stove, and i only use lights when necessary. in the summer i had an air conditioner plugged in, and i would unplug it when leaving the house. 
* in the fall month when i did not have any heater or air-conditioner on for the entire month of october and was away from the house for over a week, my hydro bill was still $320. 
* this winter i have a small infrared heater plugged in at the very minimal setting of 15°c in the living room. i have closed the doors to the bedroom and bathroom and sleep on the couch beside the heater, as temperatures are getting to be extreme. i turn the heater off when i leave the house for extended periods of time. i do not use the heating provided in the building because baseboard heating would be absurdly expensive. 

&#x200b;

i had made a few complaints to my landlord (whom i have a number of other problems with and currently have a work order issued for them for other unrelated issues in the unit). i have also called my hydro provider and they told me that my unit has had a long history of high electricity charges and all the past tenants have called complaining about it. at this point i just thought that it might just be normal in the area and that i should give up.

&#x200b;

the other day as i was leaving my unit i ran into my neighbor right across from me. he asked my how i was doing... and how my heating was (since it was so cold outside). of course i broke out complaining about how high my bills were and how cold i am all the time.

&#x200b;

**he looked at me surprised. he told me his bills have always been around $40-70. he let me step into his house, it was so warm! the guy had a heater set so high, all the doors were open and now i am extremely confused.** 

**he let me take a photo of his last hydro bill (the one where it was fall and i paid $320).**

**table i made comparing my neighbors october bill to mine**(https://imgur.com/a/hgdrf74)

&#x200b;

after finding out about my neighbors bill i am convinced that something suspicious is going on. there are only 4 apartment units in the building as we are on top of a restaurant. the third neighbor has also mentioned that their bill never exceeds $80, the fourth i have not spoken to extensively on the matter.

&#x200b;

i called hydro again and they told me they could have an inspector come and shut off the hydro to the unit to see if anyone else is connected to my hydro - such as the restaurant.

&#x200b;

i am feeling a bit helpless and would like to know if there is anything further that i should do. and if i do discover that my hydro is being bypassed, will i be able to get my money back for all these months (adding up to well over $1000 of extra payments)?

&#x200b;

if the inspector finds that nothing else is connected to me - what other possible explanation could there be?

&#x200b;

thanks for your help!

&#x200b;

\****edit***!

\- wow, thank you everyone who has contributed in helping me to solve this mystery! comments are locked and i've been receiving a number of helpful messages - even electricians willing to come by and check things out!

&#x200b;

\- basically everyone has agreed that my monthly bill makes no sense what so ever and that there must be an external factor at play (something is connected off of my meter) - at this point, it is just a matter of what that factor could be.

&#x200b;

\- some people have suggested it is the downstairs restaurant, my neighboring units, the hallway lights/security cameras. others have suggested it may be that hydro is not accurately reading the meter or the wiring is not properly set up. i have no access to the meter itself to run any of the  tests that you guys have suggested - so i unfortunately will need to rely on the landlord for that.

&#x200b;

\- some of you have suggested that i look on my online account for usage since i do not have access to a meter- however, others have said that in my area data is not fed directly into the hydro company in real time - and that looking online may not give me the answers i need.  i am still trying to access my online account to see what's going on - i tried to make an account and it says that my meter number and account number do not match up? even though i used the numbers from the bill. so i still need to wait until tomorrow to sort that out. 

&#x200b;

\- when the inspector comes by i assume he will uncover the underlying cause- i should be getting a call tomorrow  (2018-11-26) to figure out when the inspector comes.

&#x200b;

"if you think burning the american flag is free speech, then you should be okay with people flying the confederate flag. i don't really have strong opinions on the flag itself, but i see a lot people going about how it's a traitor's flag and shouldn't be flown or what not. however, considering the nature of the american flag as a symbol of american values, and those values allowing people to express their dislike of the state, i really don't see much of a difference between someone burning an american flag, a sign they disagree with american values, and the flying of what would be considered a traitor's flag (aka also a disagreement with american values)

so if you are perfectly fine with people burning the american flag, you should be pretty fine with people flying the confederate flag as well.",6

"by reading contract law textbooks to my 2 year old. obligatory this happened 7 years ago, as my son is now 9, and this decision has now come back to haunt us.

background filler:


(i graduated law school in december 2007 and passed the bar exam in february 2008.  i kept my barbri materials as i was going to trade with a friend who took the bar in a state i was debating taking it in, but that never worked out, so they remained in the office.)

the story:


our son was born in 2009 and this happened in 2011-12.  he was not any easy child to get to go to bed and we would often read to him for hours.  one night i had enough and decided to find the most boring thing i could, so i pulled out my barbri book on contracts and started reading it.  he was fascinated and demanded i read more and more.  he'd ask questions, like any good dad i answered.  so i was teaching my 2.5-3 year old contract law, and eventually more advanced contract law.  

fast forward to kindergarten.  he got upset with his teacher one day because she entered into a verbal contract to give them an extra recess if they did x and y.  well they did, but it rained, so she couldn't give them the time.  this did not sit well, as our son proceeded to lecture her on the elements of a verbal contract and how one was created and she breached it.  she had no answer for him, and we had a talk about it with her.

unfortunately, this behavior didn't stop.  he would negotiate with adults for things he wanted, and if he felt he performed his side of the contract, he would get angry if they breached.  he will explain to them what the offer was, how he accepted it, and what was the consideration.  and if they were the ones who made the offer, he would point out any ambiguity was in his favor.   when they tried pointing out kids can't enter contracts, he counters with if an adult offers the contract, they must perform their part if the child did their part and they cannot use them being a child to withhold performance.  

this eventually progressed to him negotiating contracts and deals with his classmates in second grade**.  only now he knew to put things in writing, and would get his friends to sign promissory notes.  he started doing this when they started doing word problems in math. he knew these weren't enforceable, but would point out his friends did not know this.   we eventually got him to stop this by understanding he couldn't be mad because he knows they can't form a contract.  

it culminated in third grade when he negotiated with his teacher to have an extra recess.  this time, he remembered to have her agree that she would honor it later if it rained (which it did).  so then she said she wouldn't, and he lost it and had to see the principal.   who agreed with him and talked to the teacher.

now that this happened, we had to also see the principal to discuss this.  she is astounded how good he is at this, but acknowledges we need to put a stop to it*.  so it is now put in his education plan that adults cannot engage in negotiation with him as he is adept at contract formation and tricking adults into entering verbal contracts.  

tldr: i taught my 2-3 year old contract law out of desperation to get him to go to bed.  when he got to school he used these skills to play adults. 

edit: *when i say put a stop to it i mean the outbursts when adults don't meet their obligations in his eyes. the principal encourages him to talk out solutions and to find compromise.

"update my (23m) girlfriend (21f) wants me to use a massive toy on her during sex but i feel uncomfortable. edit obligatory link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dgd49d/my_23m_girlfriend_21f_wants_me_to_use_a_massive/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

so i added this to the original post yesterday but i felt like a lot of people who saw the original probably didn't see the update, so here it is in it's own post.

so i woke up this morning to a post with over 400 comments and had a minor panic attack. i called my girlfriend and when she got to me she insisted that i tell her why i was so panicked. reluctantly i showed her my post. 

we've spent the past few hours discussing and going through the comments on the post. i think it's safe to say that we have come to a mutual understanding. 

first of all, what i picked up from her. i didn't really know why she wanted me to use it on her (although i had guessed she probably wasn't dissatisfied with the size of my penis) and so i found out that she wasn't wanting it for any sort of sensory reason, what she finds arousing about it is seeing how much she can fit in her. i also found out some other fetishes she hadn't introduced yet. 

what she found out was that my problem was not with her actually calling me inadequate but that it made me feel inadequate, not that anyone had done anything wrong but it was just my emotions about it. 

what we both learned about me is that i have a pretty deep rooted fear of inadequacy. from this to the fact that i go to the gym for multiple hours seven days a week because i was a fat kid who felt undeserving of attention from girls, to my height (5'6). that's something that i need to work on, but it isn't something that will be fixed by me using the toy on her even though i feel uncomfortable. 

so now the all important part where i tell you the decision we came to. we decided that we would explore other fetishes she has that don't give me the same feelings for now and this is something that we may revisit down the road at my discretion when i feel like i've worked through the root issue enough. 

tl;dr we aren't using it for now, but it may be revisited when i've figured out the root problem of my emotions regarding it.

edit shout out to the people acting like not doing one sexual act is going to lead to an unfulfilling sex life for my girlfriend. you guys are the real mvps coming to bat for my girlfriend who was actually a large hand in forming this solution. she may think she knows what she's cool with but you guys definitely know better. /s",7

"making a public tweet about someone sexually abusing you isn't brave, go to the police.. if you're ""brave"" enough to come forward and accuse someone publicly and have your followers shame them but don't have the balls to file an official police report than chances are you're full of shit.

edit: i wrote this late. my wording shouldve been ""making a tweet instead of going to the police""

2nd edit: to clear things up a bit with a bit of context since a lot of people have taken this personally. ive seen a lot of people share their stories about their crappy experiences with cops but you guys at least tried which tells me that an actual crime happened. i'm talking about the people that don't even attempt to go to the cops and yet have no issue coming out on twitter and using their followers instead.
recently in the voice acting scene a popular va has been accused of sexual assault because he gets affectionate and hugs all his fans and sometimes pecks them on the cheek. hes now being fired from everything and some of his fellow vas are coming out saying that he sexually assaulted them too. they havent tried going to the police nor have they said anything other than the blanket term ""sexual assault"" which these days could be a hug. 
i've seen people say ""wow seeing this backlash i can see why its hard for women to come forward"" theres a big difference between going to the police and making a report and publicly going after someone that has a dedicated fan following. 
apparently this has been happening for years but no one got a restraining order against him and no one is getting specific on what it is they did. they're ""brave"" enough to use a blanket term but they don't have the balls to say whether it was rape,grope etc and then they wonder why so many people don't believe them.

"let's talk about a ""beater"". so i am the son of a mechanic of 35 years.  he's been able to keep up with the current technologies and has worked on some of the most basic and advanced vehicles in the modern era.

it pains me to see people say, ""buy a cheap reliable car"" as if that is something easy to do.  unless you know a good mechanic that has access to dealer trades and auctions it can be tough.  here in sw pa, cars over 150k miles are usually junk.  rust due to salt, transmissions blown due to hills, etc.  unless you live in the suburbs, cars are not garage kept.  my dad and i set out to find my grand mother a replacement car.  i gave her a 2005 grand prix in 2014 with no rust and in 4 years of being outside, the rockers cannot be patched anymore.

we looked at around 35 cars and unfortunately my dad is retired.  so he does not have access to dealer trades or auctions and most of his contacts have moved on or retired as well.  this is a compilation of what we saw.

&#x200b;

35 vehicles total

&#x200b;

20 costing between 4-8k

* 11 had rust beyond belief
* 6 had check engine lights for multiple things (dad had a scan tool)
* 3 had a fair bit cosmetic or mechanical issues (suspension or a ton of wear items)

&#x200b;

15 costing 8-12k

* 6 had too much rust
* 3 had check engine lights for multiple things
* 3 had a fair bit cosmetic or mechanical issues
* 2 were priced way over market value
* 1 we found for just over 12k that we bought (was listed at 14k)

we looked at a wide range of cars. sure about half were gm, but the rest were subaru's, toyota's and honda's.  so this idea that people can ""easily"" find a ""cheap but reliable"" beater is a but insane.  many of these cars would cost even us thousands to maintain for a year.  they could easily strand my grandmother as she travels to my uncles house every month (2 hour drive).  her old 2006 grand prix started to have issues, water pump, suspension work and the rockers were shot, patched 3 times.

now i am not advocating for buying a new car.  but we ended up reaching out to my other uncles and they all put together money for a 3 year old chevy trax for her.  it has far more safety features than her old car, does much better in every crash test, should be reliable for 3-5 more years, etc.  we could have gotten her a sonic/cruze but she didn't feel comfortable in them (too low and small) and she's in her 80's so comfort is a thing.

but the moral to the story is, when offering ""advice"" you need to understand that a ""cheap but reliable"" car is not an easy find and if you live up north very difficult to do in many cases.  don't assume that everyone has connections and has a reliable mechanic that can easily find good and cheap deals.  my dad found me that 05 grand prix that i drive for 5 years and it was about 8k when i bought it in 2009, but that was back when he had unlimited access to thousands of cars.

&#x200b;

\*\*\*edit\*\*\*i want to clarify something.  reasonably safe & reliable vehicles do exist under 5k.  even in my area.  out of 1 gem there are 10-20 pos junkers.  my point is, the average person cannot change their own oil.  they wait 6 months after the oil light comes on to change it, drives tires to the cords and didn't know you need to replace brake pads.  those same people also don't have a reliable mechanic, know someone at a dealership or someone who goes to auctions.  they do not have the know-how to find a cheap but reliable car.  and if you take a look at the marketplace or craigslist, people who are selling most of these cars say, ""only needs $20 part to pass inspection"".  and if you're on a 5k budget, can you afford to take 10-15 cars to a mechanic charging $100-150/car?

let's also take a look at safety.  back in the day, without automation, head-on collisions were far more common this is why there was not need to put the front brace all the way across the front of the car.  due to better safety features, small-overlap is more common.  you're 2004 civic has no front brace at a 15\* offset but that 2017 cadillac the other person is driving does.  so surviving a small overlap crash in an older vehicle is actually very low.

i am not saying buy a new or expensive car.  my point is, once you're financially sound, you should look to save and buy a more reliable and safe vehicle.  spending 10-14k on a cpo vehicle, unless you're in a financial mess is not a bad idea.  those sub 5k beats can cost more than double in maintenance in just 2-3 years.  take that 5k, put it down in a 2-3 year old cpo vehicle and pay off the other 5-9k over a 2-3 year period and drive that car for another 5 years.  if you have to get a beater, please get someone who can help because i've seen hundreds of people get swindled.

"i m61 just found out my wife f51 ran up debt on 6 credit cards that totals 103,000 dollars.. update: a little long but this is where we are now

i want to thank all those that responded, it was a tremendous help. i wrote my post last night, couldn't sleep and didn't have any direction to proceed. based on your feedback, all of her credit cards have been cut up. she has committed to paying the debt off, and has established some favorable job interviews on monday, one related to teaching, another as sexual assault nurse examiner. after going through the finances again the total debt is 112,000. the interest is 19 to 20%, and she was only paying the minimum and not paying much on the principal. i have contacted my financial advisor and will meet with him on tuesday, he understands the issue and we will pick the right option for consolidating the debt. she is losing authorization to our bank account and all of her spending will go through me. she is not on drugs or gambling, the money was spent mostly on clothes. after our son was born, she was a stay at home mom until he went to 1st grade. during this timeframe is when she started the spending. her weight was up and she had very little to do, and her self esteem was low and she got credit cards in her name (only) and started buying. she thought she would pay debt off after getting a job, but the whole situation spiral out of control. i was traveling a lot for work and she was handling the finances. this was hidden until i discovered it last night. i feel we can recover financially but depends mostly on her. i was criticized for making her tell her parents what she did. we are in a small town in the deep south and family is important. my parents are not alive, and i needed her parents for support and getting her on the right path. she is an addict, and although this shamed her, she has to hit rock bottom and understand the damage she did to our family. this is the only way to recover. i met with her mother today and requested help in building her back up and not let her fall in depression or self pity. we are scheduled for couple counseling this monday and hopefully we can start repairing trust in our relationship. any additional input is greatly appreciated, but that's for all the input.



first time posting, need help on what i should do.  i m61) just found out my wife f51 ran up debt on 6 credit cards that totals 103,000 dollars. i have just retired after 35 years of working as an engineer and was unaware she was spending money out of control. since retiring, i'm more involved with the budget and found these unexplained charges in our bank account. when confronted she only told me of 3 of the six that were lower debt totaling 20,000. i dug further into our finances and made her show me her accounts with monthly charges and found more, the total was 103,000. she broke down completely crying and begging me to forgive her. she is an rn but hasn't worked for about 6 years. we have one son that recently graduated from high school, now attending 1st year of college. she was extremely involved with his school activities and functions, volunteering many hours, appearing as the perfect mom to the community. still don't know what she bought with all the money, but believe it was buying clothing and other junk for her and my son, but mostly her, over a 10 year period. i made about 160,000/year so don't understand how she spent the income and generated this extreme debt. my current retirement income cannot cover these credit debts and i'm not willing to tap into my son's college fund or 401k fund. she has committed to finding a job and paying off all the debt by herself, but i feel i have been completely betrayed and have loss my trust in her. i told her this is a game breaker for our marriage and now wondering if i should be seeing a lawyer. she says she loves me extremely and beg me not to leave and that she will fix this mistake herself and it's her problem not mine. i feel she means it, but might be more concerned about finding out. based on her personality she would be extremely embarrassed if people found out what she did. i made her call her parents and tell them what's she had done. she respects them tremendously and has always been seen as the perfect mother that did no wrong. i still love her, and both of us, love our son and don't want to split up. need help on what to do any insights or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

"it is really annoying me that everyone is being so sympathetic about this missing girl in my home town. i know that it is wrong to feel this way but still, no regrets. this 17 year old blonde white girl went missing after she drunkenly crashed her car into another car and then literally ran away from the scene. she had passengers in her car that were unconscious and bleeding profusely and she abandoned them without a second thought. the other car was a family with children and, again, this girl took off running to avoid being in trouble for a dui.

here is where i get pissed off: literally everyone in the community rushed to form a search party and is obsessively ""sending prayers for her"" and giving donations to her family. why? she did literally the same thing that that ""affluenza teen"" ethan couch did and we all hate him for it! she sounds like a really shitty person to do what she did. she abandoned her critically injured friends and seriously injured family in the other car, and took off running from an accident she caused while drunk just to avoid being in trouble. fuck this girl. i don't feel like she deserves all our donations and ""love and support"" it just seems ridiculous to me. 

when we see a black teenager on the news that gets shot while stealing candy or something, and people say ""well they shouldn't have been breaking the law and they wouldn't have been killed"" but suddenly this girl gets trashed drunk and drives into a car with a family inside, peaces out from the accident scene and we should all be sending her money and ""praying for her safe return?"" absolutely not.

&#x200b;

thanks for everyone that gave me their advice. a lot of you have assumed schizophrenia or the rare capgras delusion. some of you assumed she was cheating which is something i won't even address.

thinking about it, capgras really fitted the symptoms but i couldn't just accept that, still hoping she was somehow fucking with us or that it was something mild and temporary and i just overreacted.

after they took her in, i drove to the mental institute to give an exact explanation of what happened in the last week. the psychiatrist assumed some sort of schizophrenia. they told me they will look after her and i should go home to my children. i felt like i was drunk the entire time, i couldn't close a single eye at night.

the psychiatrist called me yesterday evening and asked me to come to her office. i left my children with their grandparents and drove for what it felt like an eternity.

she told me straight up that she strongly assumes that its capgras. she never saw a case of capgras before but it fits everything she gathered. she explained to me how the past 2 days went down.

my wife arrived there, being extremely hostile. she was put in a 'safe room' where she couldn't hurt herself. she calmed down after a couple of hours and the psychiatrist was able to talk to her. the good news was, that she quickly opened up and explained to her what she thinks. she 'knows' that her family and most of her friends have been swapped by clones. she assumed that we, 'the clones', have sent police officers to get her and that she was scared of what we might do to her. she flew in the first place because she felt that we might attack her but mostly to get some space. she still isn't sure if the 'clones' are malicious or not. that explains why she was distrusting me and always searched for some signs in me and the kids. my wife said that we act exactly like the real ones and how perfect our disguise was, but she knew that we aren't real because she didn't feel any love towards me or the kids or her own parents. writing this down feels like a lance piercing through my chest.

she also told her how she was trying to hide her distrust of us, because she couldn't be sure if we know that she knows that we aren't the real 'we'. her delusion that we've been swapped came to her 1 day before i noticed it. 10 days ago. she woke up, looked at me and knew that i wasn't the same anymore, not the real one. same with the kids, her parents and her friends. she hadn't had those thoughts before.

she asked the psychiatrist if she knows who swapped us or why it happened or if this happens often. she tried to avoid answering her question because she wasn't sure how my wife would react if she gave in or took her out of her delusion. my wife asked her when she can get out again, the psychiatrist asked her if she wants to get out and she answered that she's ok being here. it gives her some comfort being with professionals and she now has time to think. it helps that my wife is a nurse and that she respects doctors a lot.

the psychiatrist explained to me, how they will try to slowly deconstruct her delusion and that it can take a short or a very long time until she fully recovers. she explained to me that it's possible that she might never truly recover. but the fact that she opened up about it and doesn't necessarily feel scared is a good sign. im still not allowed to see her as it could make her panic. she apperas to be completely clear of mind about everything else. she knows names, dates, places, facts and everything she knew before. only the thought that we aren't the real ones is now a fact for her. now i wait, till they have some good or bad news of how she develops.

writing all of this down really helped me. i'm trying to wrap my head around this situation and im mostly scared for her and the children. i can't hide how distressed i am and that my wife isn't at home so i explained to them that she is in a mental hospital and she has to recover. the 4yo doesn't really understand but the other two took it surprisingly well. it helps that they heard all those morbid stories my wife told them from the hospital i guess. they asked me  when they can see her and i told them that i dont know, but i hope it will be soon. i havent felt this empty and i dont know if i should be sad or angry. fuck

"you are never going to pay a gift tax. every single day someone comes in here and asks about ridiculous monetary-gifting workarounds to avoid paying gift tax. unless you come from a very wealthy family, gift tax is not something you are ever going to have to think about in your lifetime.

you can gift up to $14k per person per year without reporting anything. that means a married couple can gift a married couple $56k before any reporting is done.

the giver has to report all gifts above $14k per person per year. report, not pay taxes on. that's done on irs form 709.

above $14k per person per year, you can give away $5.45m in your lifetime without incurring any sort of gift tax.

only once you have given away $5.45m above the $14k per person per year does gift tax come in to play at all, and then gift tax is paid for by the giver, not the receiver.

so take that down payment from your parents, no one is going to tax anyone on it.

"never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it.. it may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve vs an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose (as the manager) which option you believe is best. 

in my experience when most employees come across a problem they don't know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response. 

this does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion, presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention.

edit: couple of things that have come up

1. time frame - i wasn't suggesting withholding critical information from your superior, if you have 30 seconds to tell them, come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds, even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations. you can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them, you can't teach someone with no ideas how to have them.

2. trivial matters - obviously don't bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job, it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make, if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager.

3. you should just make the decision yourself - in many situations this is correct from a pure ""efficiency"" standpoint but often if you don't take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous, it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works.

4. management perspective - i am not currently a manager, over the past 20 years i have bounced back and forth between employer/employee in different companies, combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee, i am not complaining about my current situation, i am very happy and follow this lpt on a daily basis.

edit 2: thankyou all so much, i really didn't expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing, the other lpt i follow is ""seek first to understand"" and you have all helped me (and hopefully others) to do just that.

"i 23m unknowingly outbid my gf 26 on ebay on a present for her. should i tell her i was the other bidder or keep hush?. hi reddit,

glad to be posting something that isn't cheating or something fucked up.

my gf and i really love this particular band, i always keep an eye out for cool/rare merch to get a little 'anytime' gift for each-other.

cue last week. her birthday is coming up and i found a rare version of a vinyl on ebay for waaaay under market price. i instantly bid on it and day later someone bids back, i end up in a little bidding war with this randomer and eventually win. the next day my gf and i are chatting and she begins to tell me that she had found this really cool rare bit of merch but got out bid and she really wanted it for our collection. that's when it hits me, i was bidding against her.

now, normally i would've just told her it was me and we would've got a good giggle out of it, but considering i was buying it as a surprise (birthday) i kept quiet. however now i'm starting to think i should just tell her as she's pretty bummed out about it (may seem silly to some but its a really important thing to us)

reddit, should i just own up and tell her or wait a week and a half for the big reveal then?

thanks!",7

"employer forcing us to pay for parking that we don't use.. my wife and i work for a hospital (ontario, canada) which has just implemented a policy that all staff will pay for a monthly parking pass at the main campus of the hospital. this will cost us approximately $1000 per year.

my wife and i both work off site, where parking is free. also another couple that we know that works for the hospital only owns one car, yet both are expected to pay the monthly parking fee, and others we know walk or take the bus to work also have to pay for a monthly parking pass. 

this seems like robbery to me... it has nothing to do with standards of practice (like wearing scrubs), and driving is not an essential part of job duties for most at the hospital.

"oh sister stole ~$4500 necklace and pawned it for $50. first, i'm writing this for my friend since she doesn't have an account.

her sister stole a ~$4500 necklace (that was given to her by her deceased uncle) from her dads house and sold it to a pawn shop for $50.  we don't know exactly when (her sister claims it was months ago), but my friend got this(https://imgur.com/a/bfmkwyj) in the mail.  there was a receipt included and the pawn shop should have her id on record.  also, her mom and her sister have basically admitted to all of this in text messages and claim they're going to get the necklace back ""eventually""

so, obviously she wants to go get the necklace back herself (since it's unlikely that her mom is going to do it) and file a police report.  how exactly should we go about this?  my plan is to go to the pawn shop, see what info they can give us, then go file the police report, then go back to the pawn shop and ask how we can get the necklace back.  we would prefer to not have to pay for the necklace, so could we pay for it and then have her mom pay us back?  also, what is likely to happen to her sister?

this is honestly a really upsetting time for her and her family, and the top priority is getting the necklace back and i personally would like her sister to face consequences for her actions since this isn't the first time (and probably won't be the last time) she's stolen from family.

thanks in advance!

"for no longer wanting my trans cousin in my wedding party?. throwaway because my sister knows my reddit. 

i'm getting married next year and i'm so excited about it. my fiance has all his groomsmen picked out, and i'm in the process of asking my bridesmaids. i'd also have liked to include my twin cousins e and a in the bridal party, as we were always so close growing up. a is a guy and lives a few hours away. e is ftm, which i'm sad to say plays a major role in this aita. 

i drove out two weeks ago to visit a and ask if he'd be willing to be a part of the bridal party. i put together a box of goodies, and a card that said ""will you be a part of my bride tribe?"", deliberately not trying to use the word bridesmaid. he was excited and we talked a little bit about expectations/plans for how his and e's ties/pocket squares would match the bridesmaid dresses. i specifically asked him not to mention anything to e because i wanted it to be a surprise.

fast forward to this weekend and i meet e for lunch. i give him the same little box of goodies with the same card. e's reaction didn't go as i expected. he got really angry, accusing me of wanting to ""fit him back into a feminine bridesmaid mold"" despite his transition. i tried to explain that i'd picture him and his brother wearing color coordinated suits, but i didn't get the chance because he kept talking over me. i feel like he went off the deep end. he called me bigoted, asked why i wanted him to support a wedding that would only end in a divorce, called me ""basic"" and adhering to stupid sexist traditions. he left without giving me a chance to really explain.

i guess today e finally calmed down and talked to his brother who must have explained because he sent me a text message apologizing and saying he'd be in the bridal party. i drafted a text message saying basically that while he's still invited to the wedding, given his feelings towards me, it's best if he isn't a part of the bridal party. my fiance says i should do whatever makes me comfortable, but my mom seems to think i'm being to harsh on e and should have seen this misunderstanding coming. she says i should be more understanding, considering the abuse/discrimination he must face. she says i should give e a second chance and if i don't it will cause all kinds of family drama.

would i be the asshole if i refuse to let him be a part of the wedding party?

eta: 
wow, i cannot believe how much this blew up. so i'm going to clarify a few things here in hopes that it addresses your questions.

e sent me a text apologizing. his apology was for ""snapping at me"". he admitted he was wrong and it was ""totally out of line"" and now that he talked to a he knows what i meant and would be in the wedding party ""if i'd have him"". nothing specific was mentioned, and i haven't sent any response yet. 

a also did call me this evening, but i was out to dinner and missed his call. i called him back but right now we seem to be playing phone tag.

also, e is a man. he uses the pronouns he/his/him. just because he may have been an asshole/acted out of anger does not give anyone license to misgender him. if you want me to take you seriously, use the correct pronouns for e.",3

"i was a witness to an auto accident - now i have a $500 collections bill for an ems/firetruck dispatch on my credit report. back a couple years ago i was a witness to a multi-car auto accident on the freeway where firetrucks, ambulances, and multiple tow trucks had to be called.  to preface, no damage was done to my vehicle.  no insurance claims were filed against me or on my behalf.  everyone in my vehicle was fine (albeit shaken) and we drove away from the scene after giving a statement.  these facts matter.

a week after the accident i received a bill for $500 for the fire/ems crews that showed up.  i immediately called the number on the bill and was told that everyone involved in the accident was charged $500 to recoup the cost of sending those crews out (isn't that what my taxes are for?) but not to worry because my insurance will cover it in my claim.  i told the guy i didn't file a claim because no damage was done to my vehicle and i only stayed as a witness.  i was told that if i was only a witness then i shouldn't be charged a fine and i need to write that in a letter and mail it to them for their records and they'll take care of it.  seems reasonable and simple enough so that's what i did.  

a few months go by and i receive the same $500 bill saying it's going to collections if i don't pay immediately.  i call the number again and tell them the same story.  they also tell me the same story - i need to write a letter and send it in to them.  i told them i already did that and they said maybe i didn't write things out clear enough and to write another letter and send it in.

this was 2 years ago and i thought everything was good to go because i never heard anything again.  apparently that's not the case because it proceeded to go to collections during this time and within the last 12 months i had this $500 bill show up on one of my credit reports dinging me 50 points.  i've disputed this collection through the credit reporting agency but it's still on my report.  what do i need to do to make this go away?  it's extremely frustrating.

**edit:** some things i forgot to mention:

* the guy i talked to on the phone the second time told me not to worry about it going to collections because their collections department was the guy 2 cubicles over from him. it never goes to a third party collector. if i write to the collections department, i'd be writing to the same office i've already written to.

* going to the news seems like a good idea as an anonymous person, but the practicality of putting my identity and face on tv to complain about my city government is a thought that terrifies me and is not something i'm interested in.

* i also no longer have the bill or the contact information from the agency that sent it to me.  how can i find this?

**edit 2:** rip my inbox. i promise i will read all the responses and try to respond to them. it's definitely going to take me a few hours and it's getting late so please bare with me. ",10

"by pranking my girlfriend. yesterday i decided to prank my girlfriend by pretending to be my twin brother. random as fuck, i know. but i've always wondered if i could fool her into thinking i was him. it was time. 

so, there i was, approaching my house and ringing my doorbell completely in character. i was wearing torn denims and converse sneakers, the complete opposite of what i normally wear but exactly the style to match my bro. i was walking like him, talking like him, sounding like him, hell, even smelling like him. 

my girlfriend eventually opened the door and saw deepfake me standing there. regardless of how well prepared i was to play my twin brother, the moment i locked eyes with my girlfriend, i expected her to see right through my facade. she stared at me, confused. at first i wasn't sure if that was because she knew it was me or because she was surprised to see it's my brother.

there was only one way to find out. i said hi and dropped the ""i was in the neighborhood"" line. my girlfriend suddenly pulled me inside and slammed the door shut. 

girlfriend: are you out of your fucking mind showing up here like this?

me: uh... thought i'd visit.

girlfriend: and i thought we agreed to stop seeing each other. 

me: what do you mean?

girlfriend: what the fuck do you mean, what do i mean? whatever that shit was between us, it's over. go home to your fiancee. 

me: enough. it's me. your boyfriend. 

girlfriend: you don't know when to give up, do you? 

i showed her my id. i'd never seen so many mixed emotions flash across her face until that moment. at first she tried to play it off like she was in on the act all along and this whole interaction was nothing more than a cheating girlfriend narrative she fabricated on the spot just to fuck with me. i wasted no time calling my brother and fucking forcing a confession out of him. the motherfucker admitted to seeing my girlfriend on and off behind my back for months. when that call ended, so did my relationship with both of them.

"for making gargoyle noises while my overtly loud roommates have sex late into the night after repeatedly asking them to quiet down?. so, i've been having this problem for a while now with my roommate. but basically, his girlfriend makes ridiculously loud moans and screams during sex late into the night on weekdays that keeps me awake.

i've asked him numerous times to just have his gf not do that since it is something he can control and me and my gf are quiet when it's late on a weeknight out of common courtesy.

well, it didn't stop. 

anyway, since i'm at my wit's end for him not respecting my wishes, i've decided that whenever it happens to make grotesque, gargoyle noises beneath them and scream it out of my window until i kill their mood as a way to put a stop to it.

the noises are kind of, like, skreeeeeeeoooooooash! skreeeeascchhhhh! followed by snorts and the like.

so far, it has proven about 50% effective, and he is asking me what i'm doing downstairs. i brush it off like it's no big deal and i really don't know what he's talking about, citing it's probably my other roommates playing video games. his audibly loud gf (amazingly) seems able to stop her moaning and screaming during sex whenever the first floor gargoyle rears its ugly head.

"getting a babies ears pierced should be illegal.. edit: i'm against circumcision as well, i'm against anything to a baby that isn't medically needed. i'm just having this argument about piercings because i've never seen it discussed. it's the same as tattooing a baby. you're modifying their body without their consent at all. they have no idea what day it is, so how can they tell you yes that they want piercings? 


i've wondered this all my life. 

when i was a kid, i got my ears pierced. i had waited so long and finally after my mom was sure it was what i wanted, she let me get them done. i went to the place and saw a baby screaming as she was getting her ears pierced. her mom was holding her and telling her to quiet down because she was screaming. i remember looking at my mom and asking why she was doing that. my mom sometimes just didn't have an answer and that was a time that she didn't. even then i knew something was wrong with that picture. 

so now i'm older and realize that getting babies ears pierced is really fucked up. the baby can't even say yes or no to wanting their ears pierced. we all throw a fit when someone can't consent to something these days, so really why is this allowed? 

i've met people who had this happen and they didn't like the idea of piercings, but still had the holes in their ears from it. i got mine done years ago and i never wear earrings, but the holes are still there. i don't regret it, but i can't imagine how people feel that they got their ears pierced against their will when they couldn't even understand the meaning behind it. 

anytime i bring this up it's an ""you're overreacting"" or ""it's not your child, why do you care?"" i feel like i'm going insane here, but how is this okay. how is piercing a baby who can't even understand what pierced ears are okay? ",6

but after getting lots of great comments from you guys as well as talking with my closest friends, i got enough encouragement to gain some faith in my self. i finally opened my eyes to what i had thought deep down, that there was no chance in hell that i would ever gonna get over what my wife did, so i decided last thursday to tell her i wanted to end this marriage.

i think she knew it was coming as she didn't seem that surprised. she didn't even try to persuade me or anything. just went like a broken record ""nothing i say will change anything"" whenever i asked her to say anything. there was lots of crying and she called in sick to work. we have since then been telling our closest friends and family about the incoming divorce, but she has been incredibly hesitant to admit what she did to her parents.

my mother knows everything, but i for some reason agreed to not tell the in-laws about what happened yet. maybe i'm afraid of a ""war"" between my soon to be ex wife and me so i agreed to give her time to tell them. when we met them last sunday we told them about the divorce but as we had to leave two of our kids with them for three days due to school holiday, it didn't feel like the right time to come clean about their daughter's multiple affairs. instead we told them that there was some ""unsolvable disagreements"", which felt really bad for me to say, because they seemed so disappointed. they have been part of my family for almost 17 years and i care about them, and they have been really supportive to us through the years, both financially and they love spending time with our kids. i felt really bad about lying to them, but i'm afraid that if i go and spill the beans, my soon to be ex wife will become hostile and make the divorce process that much harder. but my patience is not limitless. i will tell them eventually if my ""wife"" doesn't come clean soon.

i don't want the real reasons for the divorce to go public either, as we live in a small society and the truth would eventually find it's way to my kids and they might get picked on because of it. i'd rather for the truth to remain with our closest friends and family, while the official explanation would be that we divorced due to ""growing apart, wanting different things etc."". i also don't want to be known as the ""poor guy who had his wife porked by another guy"".

now there are some big loose ends to tie. we need to sell our house and find apartments for ourselves. the custody will be shared where i will have the kids for a week and their mother for the other week. i also feel like their legal address should be with me, so i won't have to pay her child support. would be unfair after what she did. i have no idea how this will end, but often in my country, the mother tends to get what she wants, as everyone always feels sorry for them. i will fight for my kids though.",7

"by being too good at my job. so this has happened over the last month and half coming to a head yesterday.

&#x200b;

i started a new job, admin, about a month and a half ago. i do pretty basic administrative work: check deposits, filing, follow ups, etc. it's a full time gig, and it might take me half of the day to do all my duties. i don't know who had this job last, but they fucked around a lot. i try to fuck around and i still get things done super fast. this has led to frustration for me and my supervisor because i run out of things to do, and i have to interrupt her work so she can find things for me to do.

&#x200b;

btw, i am not the kind of person where i enjoy getting paid to do nothing. sure, it's nice on occasion, but not half of the day every single day.

&#x200b;

fast forward to yesterday: i ask my supervisor if there was anything i could work on, and she asks me to shut her door. she asks me how i feel about getting my hours cut. not just by a few hours. she's thinking me being there 25 hours per week! that's significant.

&#x200b;

moral of the story: don't do your best because you will get punished for it.

&#x200b;

tl:dr i did my job too well and got my hours cut for it

&#x200b;

edit: thank you to everyone on the ""real world"" advice. it does suck, but that's the way it goes, i suppose. my boss called me into his office to talk about the situation. he firstly apologized for suggesting hours being cut before they had a game plan. he made it very clear that he and the company appreciates my work ethic and initiative and that they do not want to lose me as an employee. apparently, when they hired me on there was originally going to be more work duties for me, but for some reason out of his control, that didn't happen. they are going to merge me into another area so i can fulfill a normal working week, not have hours cut, and most importantly keep my pay.

"by getting hulk hogan stuck to my foreskin. even though this happened over a decade ago, my family still occasionally roasts me for it.

back when i was around 9 or 10 my family bought me these toys for christmas(https://m.imgur.com/a/ad358js). as the pictures suggests, you could ""connect"" a figure's fists to anothers via the magnets on the fists themselves - which happened to be **really** strong.

you can probably see where this is going already... in my not-so-clever mind i wanted to see if i could connect the wrestlers to my foreskin. i remember stretching my foreskin with one hand whilst also holding one of the wrestlers fists against the stretched skin. then with my other hand i grabbed the other wrestler and slowly brought its fist closer to the foreskin where the other fist was sitting on the other side. **snap** i fell over and screamed in agonising pain, as not only were hulk hogan and goldberg stuck to my foreskin - they were pinching the end like a snapping turtle. 

hulk and goldberg held their grip while i screamed in pain. i tried pulling them apart but due to the pain or panick i just couldn't.

to my absolute embarrassment, my mum and dad rushed into the room and had to pull hulk and goldberg from my dick.

this story is still brought up at christmas dinners to this day.

"for telling a girl at the gym that her pants are see through?. my gym has multiple squat racks facing mirrors opposite each other. this means that while your in the rack looking in the mirror, over your shoulder on either side is other people facing away from you in their own rack.  because it might help with context i'm 6', 170lbs (so not some giant bodybuilder) and the girl in this story is average height and weight as well (not some fitness model but not substantially overweight either).  

while in between sets, i'm standing with my arms on the bar and generally feeling like shit after my first few heavy sets when i see a girl behind me in the mirror at the bottom of her squat and immediately notice that i can clearly see her ass through her pants. 

like 90% of people in the gym i just want to be left alone, ignore everyone, and pretend the world doesn't exist.  so i move on with life and do another set, but then she does her set and sure enough when she is at the bottom of her squat her yoga pants are stretched on her ass they go completely see through and i can pretty much see her butthole.  i don't mean if i squint and stare, i mean plain as day, anyone on my side of the racks can see through her pants. 

no idea why i cared (am married and completely uninterested) but i go into helpful mode and pull my headphones out and turn around quietly enough that only the two of us can hear say this:

""hey this is super creepy, but i'd feel creepier if i didn't say something.  when you squat, your pants stretch and go completely see through on your ass.""

again i thought i was being helpful and that she'd want to know, but wholly shit did she not see it that way. this girl practically screams ""you fucking pervert! stop staring at my ass!"" 

not needing to be told twice now that half the gym is staring at me, i go back to my workout and suffer the angry looks for another 20min and go home.

"for telling my kid i would help him get a switch if he can beat ocarina of time?. my 10yo kid has been saving his money (birthday, allowance etc) for months now to get a nintendo switch so he can play botw. right now he has $200 saved up. at his current allowance ($10/week) it will still take him months to be able to afford it.

i know he really wants it as all of his friends have one, and he hasn't been obnoxious about it - just diligently saving up his money. now i have to say, he's a really good kid. kind, smart, does his chores without complaining, friendly to everyone. he's been making great grades in school and was even made captain of his soccer team.

instead of making him do more chores to earn more money, i thought of a more fun solution to help him get his switch. i told him, if you can beat ocarina of time (without googling for help - though i would help him along the way if he got stuck) on my old n64, i'll pay for the rest of your switch and get you botw. wife was initially opposed to the idea but then thought it could be a fun father son bonding thing, so she went along with it. part of my reasoning too is i just want him to appreciate how far video games have come, and oot is a timeless classic. 

he jumped at the idea! after a weekend of playing, he's already at zoras domain as young link. he seems to be having fun with it and hasn't gotten too frustrated yet. he's only played minecraft really so the dated graphics don't bother him either. 

but anyway i told a couple friends about it, and they think i'm a massive dick. that i'm trying to relive my childhood vicariously through my son, and that i should just get him the switch because he's already such a good kid. now i'm having second thoughts and am feeling bad about it, but he does seem to be enjoying the challenge.

i know basically nothing about economics or finances (except don't spend your money if you don't need to, obviously). is there something i can invest in to grow my savings substantially? like i said, i won't be working, so i won't be adding to what i've saved. also, i'm sorry if this is a stupid question. i looked at the guides posted here and most of it flew over my head.

update: 
thanks everyone for the advice. i posted this just before bed and woke up to an exploded post with lots of different opinions to listen to. the two big takeaways i have from this are 1) educate myself on finances before i make a decision and 2) keep doing what i'm doing and save money. it's really important to me to have financial independence and the freedom that brings, so i'm trying to take charge of what my money does. now to address the advice i've gotten:

after a bit more research i may put it in an ira like many have recommended. i agree that i should be looking for the best way to invest rather than the fastest way to make money. i'll definitely keep at least half of my savings for a rainy day fund. ive gotten some pms about book recommendations, which i really appreciate. i'll be heading to the local library soon. cryptocurrency is interesting to me since i'm a cs major, but i won't view that seriously as an investment since i don't fully understand it yet. i may take a couple hundred dollars and play around with it, though. i will also be looking into vanguard because that was mentioned a lot, too.

i would go to a cafe before i started work for a half hour and have a latte and have time to myself. my friend was there typing on a laptop. we started talking and i found out he came every day to write a book in his spare time and he was in the publishing business. 

i told him i never finished high school and he said he'd help me get my ged. the next day he brought me some books published by where he worked. he helped me study and i passed. 

he helped me get a job as a receptionist.  i can afford better care for my child.

"by trying to have a threesome with my girlfriend.. so this happened last night. my girlfriend and i have been trying to have a threesome for a while now but could never really find the right girl. yesterday she reconnected with one of her old middle school friend and they were hanging out at the mall. she called me and asked if they could come by my place after for some drinks and i agreed.

they come over around 9pm and my girlfriend gave me that look. i knew that she talked to her about having a threesome with us and the girl agreed to it. so i play some music and bring out some drinks. everything is going good until she brings out her own stash of alcohol and weed.

the girl brought two 4locos and starts chugging. (for those who don't know 4locos is this really harsh alcoholic drink that's 4 servings of alcohol in one can that can really fuck you up.) she has two of them. then she rolls a blunt and smokes it. (i didn't drink or smoke at all) by that time my girlfriend is tipsy from the hennessy i have and starts making out with me. the girl is on the bed watching and obviously starts getting turned on. but a few minutes later she told us she's really tired and wants to go back home. i'm bummed out but we all get in the car and i drive her home.

i'm driving her home down these dark back roads. the whole time she's telling us how she loves having us as friends and that she's sorry for being so tired and all that. then she starts gagging and making pre vomit sounds i guess? anyways i pull over to the side of the road so she can do her business. she gets out and starts sprinting down the road (rip me) i start chasing her down the the dark road and i catch up. she looks me dead in the face and asked me who i was. i told her i'm her friend and that she's not feeling well and my girlfriend and i was taking her home. she's says ok but continues to walk away and a car goes by. she waves her arms and screams for help and i grab  her saying wtf are you doing? then she bites the shit out my hand. i let go and she runs into the street. i'm a black guy with dreads and she's a skinny white girlfriend so the sight of me chasing her is pretty comical. she managed to flag down a truck, a man and wife, and begs them for help. my girlfriend pulled up and very calmly told her friend to get back in the car. the girl screamed get away from me hides in the bush. the couple calls the police. the police showed up and asked everyone questions and took the girl back to her parents place.

no sex was had but instead i got a few cuts from the bite so that's kinda kinky i guess.

&#x200b;

i said i'd come back if anything relevant happened!

&#x200b;

ex-bf kept trying to get in touch through common friends. they kept asking me to unblock him and at least hear him out, cause he was really sorry, he loved me, he was a mess, he didn't mean to, someone even went as far as to ask me if i was really sure it happened. they offered to send me prints of texts where he was talking about me, so i'd see how he always had great things to say and how much he cared. but i've had it with the print screen drama for life, and said no. to the ones who insisted i told them i wasn't unblocking him, had nothing to say or hear, and if they kept pushing me, i'd block them too.

i ran into ex bf at this book thing i go to often (hobby of mine). maybe i'm being presumptuous, but i think he went there for me. he didn't really have any business there, but i'm just speculating really. he asked if i had a few minutes for coffee, i said i was late (lie). he walked me to my car. he looked so good, smelled great. he was so sweet. was even wearing his hair the way i like it. i fell horrible cause even after everything, i still like him. he apologized some more, said he knew i needed time and space but asked if i'd consider giving him another chance cause he would wait for me. said he would never talk to jessie again, and would act like they had restraining orders against each other. and i just found it really funny how everything he was saying required me trusting him. which i don't. so i told him i wasn't interested anymore and he should move on. i wish i said something snappier or wittier. but i had nothing.

this was saturday, i haven't heard from him or friends since. i think that was that. 

&#x200b;

jessie also kept trying to talk to me. like i told some of you on comments, i had a trip coming up, it would have been me, jessie, ex bf, and a few friends. since jessie couldn't afford it, my parents payed for most of her expenses. she must have remembered this right after everything went down and panicked cause i had everything (vouchers, confirmations emails, credit card info...). she went crazy. even showed up at my place (i wasn't home and my roommate told her to fuck off, exact words). i didn't block her at first cause i admit i was having some fun watching her despair.

i talked to my mom and she was amazing. told me i should cancel everything even if it costed us money, it was fine. so i did. and for one last bit of print screen drama: i printed all the emails i got confirming cancellations and sent those to jessie with the word ""bye"" before blocking her.

&#x200b;

my roommate has been amazing. we were never really close and now i don't even know why. she cancelled plans with her friends to stay with me and invited me to go out with them next weekend.

&#x200b;

a few of you suggested i see a therapist and i did, yesterday. i really liked it. it was just one appointment and i mostly just talked, but it felt good. she gave me ""homework"": she talked a little about unhealthy and abusive relationships and asked me to think about my friendship with jessie and try to point what was healthy and what was unhealthy about it. made me realize she was never really my friend. she was taking advantage of me for years and she even had me thanking her for it. therapist also told me about this saying (i think that's what it is) called ""the narcissist's prayer"", which goes something like ""that didn't happen. if it did, it wasn't my fault. if it was, i didn't mean it. and if i did, then you deserved it"", which is totally how jessie is handling this whole thing now.

so good riddance indeed

&#x200b;

and a final piece of gossip. ""pete"" talked to me yesterday (he is checking up sometimes, he's a good guy. again, he is gay, in case someone is still thinking this might turn into a romantic comedy) he said jessie was super sure that since i broke things off, she and dean would hook up right away. but apparently he doesn't have the same plans and that freaked her out over the weekend. pete says he really is a mess and went out drinking hard 4 nights in a row to the point he had to be carried home by his pals. and yesterday, they all went out for lunch at this burger place, jessie was going to run her fingers through his hair or something and he just pushed her away and told her to stop and to never touch him again. (great that **now** he manages to do that, huh?)

i guess in the end he really did like me in his sick way. the thing is, i don't want to be with someone who likes me in a sick way. i want to be with someone who likes me in a healthy way. i thin i deserve that.

&#x200b;

i am also thinking about taking the money i got back from the trip to go somewhere else by myself. haven't decided though.

&#x200b;

anyway, this will be the final update on this, since it is unlikely that i will have anything new to add

now, i think i just need time to heal and let go, you know?

i might come back in a few months if there is reason to do a ""yay life is awesome now"" post, but i wanted to post this update now cause i wanted to end this whole story on a bright note. and, of course, thank you all again!! you are the best!!

"for leaving my toddler with my 'childfree' sister for a few minutes, resulting in a trip to the emergency room?. i (18f) have a 2 year old daughter who lives with me and her father (18m), but spends two daytimes a week with my mom so that i can run errands (such as going to the doctors, doing the food shopping, cleaning the house, etc) and because my mom loves to spend time with my daughter. 

my 27 year old sister was visiting my mom's house for the week from out of town. my sister and i have never really got on, when i got pregnant she thought it was the worst thing ever, and insists that children ruin your life and thinks i force my daughter on my mom (despite my mom saying otherwise). so, when i went to drop my daughter off with my mother at around 11am like usual, i was shocked to find my sister there alone. i asked her where my mom was, and she said my mother had gone to the shop and would be home within a few minutes. 

my sister has always been very dismissive of me, she hates talking to me and will do anything to shorten the conversation, which is why i think this happened. i huffed because i was catching the bus into town to go the doctors, and it left in a few minutes. my sister rolled her eyes. i asked her if there's any way she would have my daughter for a few minutes just until mom came back, she had just woken up from a nap (she always sleeps in her stroller) so she would be happy to just sit on the sofa and watch tv until mom came back. my sister said 'absolutely not, i hate children and i don't feel comfortable being alone with her'. 

now, i completely understood this and i think she was very clear in saying she didn't want to. i called mom on the doorstep and she said she was just leaving the store now, so she would be max five minutes. my sister rolled her eyes and said 'fine, i'll take her', and she took the baby out of the stroller. i was in a rush and thought my sister would be able to cope for five minutes. i didn't even think it would be a matter of 'coping' because it was such a short amount of time and the kid was tired.

so i left, and went for the bus. literally five minutes later i get a call from my mom that they're taking my kid to the er because she cracked her head open on the living room table. apparently my sister had left the room for a couple minutes and my daughter wondered where she was going as she is never alone, so she tried to get off the sofa to follow her, and she slipped and whacked her head. 

i am absolutely raging at my sister. i don't get how she could be so fucking stupid to leave a kid alone. she argues that i 'emotionally manipulated' her into babysitting, which i feel i didn't. she says she thought it would be fine to leave the kid while she made a cup of coffee, but i feel like it's common fucking sense not to leave a kid on their own for more than like two seconds.

"update my room mate is accusing me of grand larceny. i've been forced out of my home and my belongings are currently being thrown out of the window and onto the street. nyc.. first and foremost, i just want to say thank you for the support and the advice given to me. i did not expect such a huge amount of outreach. 

when i posted yesterday, it was just a jumble of words that i put together without putting in much thought because well i just got a phone call telling me all my things were being thrown out the window and i pretty much panicked.  

for some context, i've been living in the same apartment complex for about four years. i'm very well acquainted with the neighbors, security, superintendent and so on. so while i was away on vacation, when the accusation happened my room mate went around the complex to anyone who would listen that i stole $3700, i'm wanted for arrest and there's a restraining order refraining me from even coming onto the premises. this is how i was able to get the information through word of mouth. 

so from all the advice that i was given.. i decided to check on this ro and couldn't find it at all in the system. turns out my room mate merely just filed a police report and none of the things i was hearing was true. 

so i got to my apartment complex and a lot of my things were in garbage bags and was thrown out of the window. my things were everywhere. so i called the police. i let them know the situation and they came into the apartment with me along with my landlord.

my room was indeed broken into and trashed. many of my valuables such as my laptop, some sentimental jewelry that was given to me, shoes, etc were all missing. i was devastated. i filed a police report with the officers and stated everything that was missing and took a lot of pictures and videos like many of you stated.

during all this my room mate was there and it also looked as if other people started living there too. turns out my room mate is using this situation to now squat on the property, not pay rent and also brought other people and friends to live there as well? unfortunately because of this, there was no arrests even though all my valuables were missing and half my things were scattered across the street. the police said that because there is so many people coming in and out of my apartment and no witnesses they were not able to arrest anyone. i was advised that this was a matter of civil (i think) court and i would have to settle this there. they also advised me that i could stay here but they believe that it wasn't in my best interest or my safety to stay since he seemed violent and will be squatting on the property anyway which can take months to evict. so they escorted me into my room to collect whatever else i had left and i am now still staying with my friend. 

as for my lease, my landlord is understanding and feels sorry for everything's that happened. we're mutually agreeing to end the lease without any problems. 

i don't really have a place to call home now and i pretty much have to start over since i was only able to grab clothes. even if i did end up grabbing all my things, i wouldn't have anywhere to put it. in hindsight, i feel foolish for being tricked. i guess this is a do over but thanks to all of you, at least i know the next steps to take and have some understanding of what to do and i find comfort in that. again, thank you.",2

"reddit is not a bastion of free speech, and is actually highly censored by the wrong people.. hear me out.

i originally came here because i heard that reddit was built upon free speech and free thinking. that was a lie.

subreddit communities can make lists of rules and whatnot to make clear what kind of things they don't want on their sub, and that's okay.

the problem with the rules and independent moderation of reddit is that, subs are just using their lists of rules as generalizations which in turn become excuses to censor people who don't agree with them. 

generally, once you start talking about things that rustle the mods' jimmies, they will ban you. it doesn't matter if you've broken one of their rules or not, they'll just pick the rule they think is closest to what you're saying and use that as their excuse. worse yet, sometimes they don't even give a reason, or they flat out admit they just don't like what you're saying. 

most moderators just want safe spaces. they usually don't even want a safe space for their audience, they just want safe spaces for themselves, because god forbid you post something they disagree with in their subreddit, whether  you're breaking the rules or not, they'll find a reason to get rid of you.

all of this is made worse by the fact that generally the ones censoring are heavily liberal, as most people that use reddit are. (being liberal is okay, i'm a moderate, so i don't really care). both sides of the political spectrum have both good and bad ideas, but only a weak person would try to censor everything that doesn't agree with their liberal agenda. i've seen conservatives do it too. just not as much. sometimes the censorship isn't even politically motivated, people just get butthurt.

the icing on the cake is that reddit administrators are extremely liberal and will always 100% side with mods, especially if they're trying to create a safe space. 

reddit puts on this mask of ""the last bastion of free speech on the internet "" when in reality they're creating the biggest censorship atrocity on the internet. i have faith in time it will die.

censorship will kill reddit.

safe spaces will kill reddit. 

cancerous moderation will kill reddit.

admins who side with the more socially acceptable will kill reddit.


edit: by ""moderate"" i'm saying that i'm in the middle, i base my political beliefs on what i think is right, and i don't agree wholeheartedly with either party. both have great and terrible beliefs. i go with logic and empathy over blindly siding with one side of a spectrum. i'm pretty sure that's what moderate means, but some people seem to think moderate is something else. i'm just clearing that up.",6

"for refusing to allow my daughter to participate in high school cheerleading?. i have a son thats entering 8th grade and a daughter thats entering 9th grade.  both of them have always been bookworms.  very studious and cerebral, just like their dad.  i also played sports all through school and i value the experience that brings.  i've always tried to push them to join sports, but neither one of my kids wanted to.  i tried to insist...maybe they would have fun?  we dont know til we try?  even just to make them exercise and meet new friends.   my wife insisted i back off.  fair enough.  

&#x200b;

now my daughter is entering high school and wants to become a cheerleader.  she has never wanted to do anything even remotely close to cheerleading at any point in her life.  she actively made fun of cheerleaders 3 months ago.  but one of the popular girls moved in down the street last month and she has become a mainstay around my house.  she's convinced my daughter that she has to become a cheerleader in high school because she was ""a loser in middle school and you don't want that to happen in high school.""

&#x200b;

i said no.  i dont appreciate that reasoning.  my wife explained that i dont ""know what its like to be a girl in high school"" and i say ok?  hows that relevant?  i also dont appreciate cheerleading.  its too dangerous.  girls get severely injured doing that, and for what reason?  we don't have the insurance to cover it.  lastly, i dont like the sexualization of the whole thing.  those outfits are a bit skimpy, and we're talking about high school girls.  my wife says i'm focusing on the bad and not the good.  most girls dont get injured.  i'm the pervert because i'm making it sexual.  i pushed for her to join a sport.  i let my son play sports.  she'll have a much better high school experience.

"(final update) my (21f) boyfriend (22m) tried to gaslight me into getting plastic surgery.. this is going to be the last post i make about this situation. i want to put the whole thing behind me and focus on moving forward now, but my last post got a lot of responses so i felt as though i needed to say at least something on the matter. 

a lot of you have been greatly helpful to me in this time and i appreciate that more than i can say. to those of you calling me an idiot or saying i was making excuses for him - i wasn't. evidently i knew his actions were wrong, otherwise i wouldn't have made the post to begin with. i clarified that he was usually very nice to me because he was. he's helped me through panic attacks, paid for a lot of my food when i've had no money, defended me against a previous abuser, and always been very attentive prior to recent incidents. of course i knew that his actions in my post were wrong, i was trying to stress that he is not normally like this & that he was not aggressive with me. this is a man that i felt safe with because he had given me all the reason in the world to feel safe with him. he protected me from a lot, and literally came to my aid at 3am once when i was alone and distraught on some random beach! of course he had my complete trust.

anyway.

following my last post, i basically avoided him and confided in some of my rl friends about it. in doing so, one of them (lets call her daisy) brought me to the realisation that i was never that insecure about my body, and that my boyfriend had simply been making me feel that way. it sort of feels like a weight has been lifted in that regard but the realisation made me so so so angry. i rarely get angry but talking to everyone and reading everything and learning more about gaslighting made me so pissed. then there was the icing on the cake - two of my friends confirmed that he did indeed go to lucy's party (no shit) but lucy hadn't actually wanted him there?? she's apparently very aware of his obsession with her and isn't entirely comfortable with it. great! i guess i'm fucking blind.

that really was the final straw for me. so last night when i saw him, i asked him about the party again and whether he went to mine or lucy's. again, he said mine. i told him that i'm not an idiot and that our friends could all confirm his whereabouts. he seemed bothered that i had been talking to people about the situation and he started with the whole ""your jealousy is really getting bad"" shit and at that point i lost my temper. i told him that i wasn't jealous, i was just trying to understand why he was lying to me about something so dumb. it wasn't even a good lie. 

we had a pretty rough argument and i brought up his constant comments about surgery and as we argued, little things started dawning on me about other stuff he had previously done. i cried a lot. he kept trying to be calm but it didnt always work.

but yeah. i'll spare the gory details. i did try to break up with him but i don't think it sunk in. as far as i'm concerned we're over, but he doesn't seem to really get it yet. i'm sure he will soon. i've blocked him on everything and i'm going to keep my distance, but we have a lot of the same friends so fully cutting him out isn't going to be as easy as i would like. i'm done with this though. he dominated so much of my life and i'm still doubting myself so much about everything but i have a lot of good friends helping me. apparently he was weird about lucy even when he was with his ex, so i think i might talk to her about the situation. 

i wanna keep moving forward. i need to get past this fucking fog in my brain that he put there. when we met he told me he'd lost a sibling in a car crash, yet no one ever spoke about it and i thought that was strange. at the time i thought it was due to grief but now i think no one spoke about it because it didn't fucking happen. i had so much faith in this man and for a long long time he really was my best friend. i already miss him and it fucking sucks but frankly i've overcome worse.

i'll be fine.

"the fibonacci sequence can help you quickly convert between miles and kilometers. the fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where every new number is the sum of the two previous ones in the series.

1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.  
the next number would be 13 + 21 = 34.

here's the thing: 5 mi = 8 km. 8 mi = 13 km. 13 mi = 21 km, and so on.

edit: you can also do this with multiples of these numbers (e.g. 5\*10 = 8\*10, 50 mi = 80 km). if you've got an odd number that doesn't fit in the sequence, you can also just round to the nearest fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer. e.g. 70 mi ≈ 80 mi. 80 mi = 130 km. subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding, and the end result is 115 km.

this works because the fibonacci sequence increases following the golden ratio (1:1.618). the ratio between miles and km is 1:1.609, or very, very close to the golden ratio. hence, the fibonacci sequence provides very good approximations when converting between km and miles.",8

"trespassers called police on me for brandishing a firearm.. yesterday around 530 am i heard a tapping on my window. my window faces my fenced in backyard which has a wooded area behind me. at first i thought it was a lizard but it was more rhythmatic. i went to look outside and as soon as i opened the curtains i see a hand tapping on my window. 

i then turned on my light and started to tap the barrel of my shotgun against the window. the trespassers saw it and immediately darted away. i call the police and a few minutes later they show up and ask where is the person with the gun.

i told them i have a gun and explained someone was trying to break in. they said they were called because someone was brandishing a weapon from inside their house, but i called and reported a break in, not on myself. apparently the person i pointed the gun at, called the police.

"for not wanting to be involved with a child i helped conceive?. i got pregnant in high school, when i was 17 (i am just turning 30 now). i wanted an abortion and my boyfriend begged, begged, begged, guilted, begged me to carry the fetus to term and that he would raise the baby himself. he involved his parents, who involved my parents, and since my parents were against abortion, they agreed on my behalf that this is what would happen.

i was naive at the time about how horrible pregnancy and delivery would be with a baby you don't want. i was miserable, in pain, anxious, isolated, and sick the whole time. delivery was a nightmare. the whole process was so traumatic that i've been diagnosed with ptsd from it, for which i've been in therapy for the last four years.

in my country, if both parents are 18 and both agree to it, one parent can legally give up parental obligations, so i did that. i haven't regretted it for a minute (i do regret not getting an abortion because of the trauma it caused me, i do not regret giving up parental rights). i do not think about this child, i do not think of myself as having a child, i am not a mother. i have never met the child and never want to.

last month, my exboyfriend contacted me (again through my parents) because he and his wife have split up and now that his daughter is 12, she wants to know about the circumstances of her birth. i told him that we did things according to his wishes and i never, ever want contact with his child and don't want him to tell her my name or contact information.

he and my parents are furious and my parents also admitted they thought i'd 'come around.' they want to be in his child's life but want me to also be a part of it. i won't. am i the asshole here? all i have done is what i have always said i would do.

"update purchased a condo, seller ""rented"" it to his nephew the day before contracts were signed. now what? ny, putnam county. i am gonna make up some names this time around because referring to people as ""the female seller"" or ""the tenant"" is cumbersome as hell.

after the mess on wednesday, i met my realtor for dinner and to grab my closing docs. the seller's agent actually wound up stopping by as well (he arranged this with my guy) . he apologized profusely, told us he knows the family and he's confident we'll be able to get things sorted quickly. i didn't get my hopes up but he picked up our tab and bought a round of drinks while he was there, so hey, when life gives you lemons, make a superhuman amount of whiskey? i don't think that's accurate but it was my approach and i stand by it.

anyway, i wound up speaking with the seller, anne, yesterday morning, and got the rundown on the situation. it turns out the unwelcome tenant (bill) is actually her nephew, not her ex's (charlie). she was absolutely livid with bill, and promised me the apartment would be vacant asap even if she had to physically drag him out herself and pay for movers to take all of his stuff. she also gave me assurances that she'd cover whatever this ordeal has cost. from there, she said she was going to check in with her sister (diane) who was dealing with bill as we spoke, and get back to me as soon as she knows something, but again promised that the absolute worst case scenario would be bill starting to move out by early afternoon.

maybe half an hour later she calls back and tells me that diane had rented a truck and bill was in the process of packing his stuff up. turns out bill had recently experienced something pretty fucking awful, and as a result had sort of become preoccupied with seeking approval from adult males. charlie was at the top of this list; apparently his midlife crisis consisted of buying a harley and trying to carry himself like a badass, and bill bought the act hook, like and sinker. and a lot of you guys assumed correctly - bill cooked up the scheme to basically extort me for a cash for keys deal. from what i was told, charlie figured a doctor from nyc would just pay out right away to be done with it. for what it's worth, i am not an md, nor am i from nyc... but you do you, chuck. anyway, at this point, anne threw me a curveball. she and diane were both at peace with the fact that i was going to pursue this with the police, but asked if i could meet bill so he could look me in the eye to apologize because she wanted him get an understanding of the fact that his actions hurt a real, live human being. i agreed to it - i was hoping to see if i could get in to check the condition of the place anyway.

so yesterday evening i went up to the apartment and met ""my tenant"" as he was loading up the truck with his stuff. we wound up speaking for a while and... well, i am gonna disappoint some of you here. he seems like a genuinely good kid who got taken advantage of by a legitimate piece of garbage... there were a lot of tears, and innumerable apologies, and i 100% believe that these were based on genuine remorse for what he did, not regret about getting caught. i'll just say it here because i don't think i was being as slick as i'd hoped in dancing around it anyway, but the kid recently lost his father, and i don't see any reason to fuck up his life with a criminal record over a (ridiculously, incredibly) stupid mistake that he was to a great extent manipulated into making anyway. for whatever it's worth, if getting involved in a stupid scam like this was the worst thing that i did at nineteen... yeah let's just say that i was a remarkably stupid and reckless kid. i lucked out and never wound up getting caught in a situation that could have had significant legal consequences, but if i had and i hadn't been given a second chance, i'd be living a very different life right now.

as far as the money goes, anne and i are going to figure out what's what, and i don't want to explain how because it involves details about her personal life, but the money will technically be coming out of charlie's pocket anyway. she started by hiring some movers to unload my truck, which is taking place as i type this. bill left the apartment in shockingly good condition, but i am basing that on what sort of damage nineteen year old me would have passively done to an apartment, so this may be a touch skewed haha. either way, no damage has been done aside from some very minor cosmetic stuff (a couple of light scuffs from moving furniture and things like that), all of which would become immaterial when i redo the apartment in anticipation of renting it out, so i am not going to concern myself with any of that stuff.

as far as charlie goes... well, i mentioned in a few comments that my attorney (who is too majestically vicious for fake names so he just becomes capital-m-my capital-a-attorney) is a super intense older guy and later found out is a ""retired"" civil litigator who can't sit still long enough to actually retire. yeah he's out for fucking blood. turns out charlie does have himself some assets, and my attorney is pretty confident that they will become my assets soon enough. i had a brief chat with one of the officers who came by on wednesday (he's a friend of diane's, apparently - this everyone knows everyone thing is still very foreign to me), and will be going by the station to issue a statement/file a report/whatever it is you do in this situation. some of you expressed concerns that he may have fled the country, but the concept of charlie leaving the county, let alone united states, is very funny to anne, diane and officer friend-of-diane. seems like charlie is just a dumbshit who thought he could pull a fast one, and will be easy enough to find at one of the local watering holes when it's time for him to be picked up. i absolutely do not believe in throwing around assumptive diagnoses for fun, but i've made an exception in this case and decided that charlie has full bore antisocial personality disorder because it makes me feel better about things for some reason. 

anyway i have been typing this piecemeal throughout the afternoon which has essentially been a test of my wife's patience. i'm not dumb enough to incur the wrath of a tiny puerto rican woman who has spent the last couple of days stressed out of her mind, so i'm gonna call this a post. thanks again to everyone on this sub for all of the advice given and sympathies expressed, i'm lucky as hell to have had this end the way it did.

"for telling a girl that she's not ""just being honest"", she's just being a bitch?. this just happened at lunch earlier and my one friend is telling me i went too far and making me second guess myself.  

there's this girl who is sort of part of my group of friends, but not really.  she eats lunch with us and hangs around before classes start, but that's it.  none of us hang out with her outside of school.  mostly because she's very insulting, all the time.  it's seriously like she doesn't know how to have a conversation without shitting on someone.  she just says ""i'm just being honest"" a lot. the problem is that she can't take a joke herself.  even polite criticism pisses her off a lot and makes shit super awkward.  my friends and i have talked about her and all of us are really sick of her, but no one has wanted to say anything because she blows stuff way out of proportion when it's about her.  

today at lunch though i had enough.  she was shit talking one of my friends for being really skinny.  ""are you sure you're not trans?  i've never heard of a guy being anorexic.""  and then, ""it's not attractive. just being honest.""   so i said, ""you're not just being honest, you're being a bitch.""  she asked me what my problem was, that she was just kidding.  and i was like, ""no one thinks you're funny.  the only thing that's funny is that you of all people think you can talk shit about how other people look.  take a look at yourself.""  

no one else was saying anything. she got mad and told me to go fuck myself and got up and left.  i was feeling pretty good about the whole thing, but my one friend told me i went too far with her and should try to talk to her tomorrow.  ",3

i got home late last night and the posts were still there so after walking my dog i called the police non-emergency line again and they said they'd send a car out early in the morning. 

i'm working from home today and sure enough around 8am a cop car pulled up to my neighbors house.  two officers stepped out and kicked around his front yard where the posts were before going up to knock on his door.  there was about a 5 minute discussion where my neighbor looked quite agitated (couldn't hear what was said) but he came out with some gloves on and pulled all the posts out while the cops watched and he seemed to be shouting at them.  the officers took the posts then one handed him something (not sure if a citation, pamphlet, or something else) and drove away.  neighbor left for work in a huff about 30 mins later.

not sure if it's the last thing the neighbor will try but at least that hazard is gone.  thanks to everyone for the advice.    ",2

"for starting a business in direct competition with my father's and making him lose clients?. so i have a father who left our family to start a new one with our neighbor when i was 13. i never fully forgave him even thought he tried (and still does) to make it up to me.

growing up, he would pay me to work with him in his company. it's pretty advanced construction finishing stuff (like custom molding for many different uses).

i worked with him on and off through college and i've gotten very good at it.

he asked me to join his company full time as  an equal owner after i graduated. but my stepmom had a fit and basically forced my stepbrother into the mix as well.

i do not get along with my stepbrother and told my father that it's either him or me. he also did not have the right skills to work in a major capacity.

to no one's surprise, my father said i needed to compromise so everyone in the family can be happy.

i refused to compromise and went ahead and set up my own company. my father was upset but i guess he figured he couldn't stop me. we continued having weekly dinners.

for some reason, people are liking my company's work more. i have expanded my company more than my father ever has. i also targetted his major clients who have slowly come over to my company. i don't even do any of the labor myself anymore unless i want to.

last week, my father broke down and said his business was struggling to survive. i admit i did feel bad so i offered him a full time job in my company and that i'd buy out his tools and workshop lease. but i told him my stepmother and stepbrother are not welcome  anywhere near my company.

this made my father pretty angry and we had a pretty big fight. he said i betrayed him. then i basically told him he betrayed me by cheating on my mother. 

i do feel kind of guilty i ruined my father's company he worked hard to build. but at the same time he forced me into this position by getting his family involved.

"if high school was the best years of your life, you have a very sad life.. you hear this sentiment often, especially from folks who were football players, cheerleaders, etc (generally popular groups). i hope they have had actually made a life for themselves after high school, but in my experience (being out of school for 22 years now)...i find the opposite to be true. the former popular kids i run into are just sad looking with dirty kids pulling on their clothes. they look depressed.

while, the ""nerdy"" kids who were basically social outcasts (especially in the 90's) are now successful, and driving nice cars...and generally look pretty damn happy!

edit: i should have elaborated to say it's sad, because high school is when you do not know who you are (figuring it all out), and most teens are awkward (in their own ways). congratulations if you enjoyed high school... i don't intend to invalidate your experience (i guess that's the pc way to say that).

i have vastly more respect for single parents that don't use being a single parent as a crutch or a method for attention grabbing. 

edit: some of my replies to comments are getting buried, so i'll clarify a few things:

1. obviously i'm not talking about widows, etc. i'm talking about those women that made poor life choices and then attempt to virtue signal, especially on social media.

2. poor life choices include not using at least two methods of birth control during sex. if birth control is not your priority, you should not be having sex.

"if i kick my boyfriend out of my house over chicken.. i love my boyfriend to death, but we have reached an impasse. i moved into my current house last year after i got a dog, specifically because i wanted her to have a huge backyard to roam around in. i bought her doggy door, and she loved it a few months later my boyfriend moved in from his apartment (though he still has the apartment) and was excited about the backyard because he always wanted chickens. he eventually bought 4 chickens and at first he kept them in an extra large dog cage, but let them free roam for most of the day. that was until we realized that my dog likes to chew there feathers off. so then the chickens had monitored outside time. then he decided that that wasn't fair to the chickens, and now won't let my dog have free access outside. he keeps her locked in her cage all day when i'm not home, and if she does need to go outside, he makes her put a muzzle on. she can no longer go outside and play with her toys, and my house is way too small for her to have room to play. he's even started scolding me even when i let her walk around inside without the muzzle inside, because he says if i'm not paying attention she might sneak outside and hurt the chickens.

&#x200b;

it's starting to piss me off because the backyard was for her. he doesn't even pay rent on my house. he refuses to make a properly gated area in the yard, even though there's plenty of room. when i remind him that my dog has a right to freedom in my house, he just reminds me on how bad the chickens look after she was done chewing them up. when i suggested him getting rid of the chickens, he says we can't because of all the missing feathers.

&#x200b;

at this point i think the only thing i can do is to ask him to leave, and take his chickens. i know he lives in an apartment, but at this point, that's his problem. if i asked him to move out?

"my (17m) twin sister (17f) has been sleeping in my bed with me. we're fraternal (obviously) and we've always been really close. her boyfriend unexpectedly died in an accident about two weeks ago, which has made her so sad that she can barely function.

the day after he died, she knocked on my door at like 3 am. when i told her to come in, all she said was ""i can't be alone in my room for one more second"". then she climbed onto my bed, got under the sheets, and went to sleep. i didn't protest or say anything, i just let her do what she wanted.

after that night, she slept in my bed every night for about four nights. it was the same situation each time. she'd come in my room and not really ask, she'd just get in my bed and go to sleep. sometimes she'd say something like ""talk about anything to distract me until i fall asleep"". she doesn't sleep in my room every night anymore, but she does it every few nights. she did it two nights ago and i'm pretty sure she'll do it again.

i have a king sized bed so it's not like she's too close to me or anything, we don't even touch all night and it doesn't really make me uncomfortable, but i'm just wondering if this is normal for someone who's grieving. also, should i tell my parents? she asked me not to but i don't know what to do

"society needs to stop defending gang activity and ""hood life"". i'm not sure how to put this, the title really explains it the best here.  i'm also writing this at 4:46 am so bear with me, i just wanted to put it down into words before i forgot.

i live in new york. i've seen my fair share of hoods.  and i browse social media and listen to tons of music, just to see people defending gang activity and such.

i really don't get it. people know killing and stealing is wrong, yet they glorify these people for their ""struggles"" when they definitely get involved with violent activity. being poor does not give you the right to kill and steal! but people will blindly listen to hiphop and rap because it's ""woke"" and they sympathize with these asshole rappers. it's become cool to break the law because ""fuck the police"", and all police use excessive force, apparently.

people on social media seem to just be so proud of their gang relations, and the crimes they commit, and post about it to their blind audience who likes and retweets everything about it. people listen to hiphop where rappers sing about the atrocities they have and still commit, and people will be like ""yo i fuck with this"" and ""yo this is so woke"".   i fucking hate it.

gangs have become a race thing. if you're against gangs, you're racist, it seems. people have tied gangs to specific races such as latinos and black people. and i think that's why it's normified, both indirectly and directly. i've literally seen movements such as ""protect our hoods"" try and directly stop deslumification. it's so stupid- there is nothing good about breaking the law or being in poverty. but people really think that this is how life is for black and latino people, which really contributes to the racism we have today.

i seriously wish we didn't come to this. a society of violent assholes seems to be on the rise to social acceptance, and it's a huge tumor to everyone. there is absolutely nothing to be proud of here. defending rape, mugging, killing, drug dealing, etc. makes you just as bad as the person committing them. gang are not a good thing, gangs are not your ""family"", gangs are a criminal cesspool.",6

"by smeagoling at my new job. this happened today. about 20 minutes ago, to be more precise.

i just started a new job about a month ago. it's a quiet office environment. i only really know the people immediately around me, but everyone's been super nice to me so far.

one of the things i love about this place is they have a bunch of free breakfast stuff in the break room. this morning i thought a bagel sounded nice so i went to go toast one up. this is where the fu begins. 

i separated the bagel into two halves and went to put it in the toaster. i've only ever owned peasant toasters, but this stainless-steel bad boy had all the bells and whistles, including a ""bagel"" setting. i figured it wouldn't hurt so i punched it and waited. 

while i stood there my mind began to drift. i started thinking about lord of the rings for some reason, specifically trying to figure out when my kids would be old enough for me to introduce them to it. i heard the door to the break room shut and assumed the only person who had been in there with me had just left.

then the toaster dinged and my bagel popped up. i took it out and was struck by how amazingly it had toasted. warm and soft on the outside, toasted perfection on the inside. i started spreading the butter, still admiring the flawless bagel in my hands. my brain was still in fantasy mode though, and i said to myself in full-on smeagol voice, ""oooh yes! we likes it! gives it to us golden and crispy!""

at this point, my rational brain kicked back in and i realized how fucking weird i can be sometimes. oh well, no big deal. i take my bagel and turn around, nearly running into a group of ladies looking at me like i just arrived from another planet. i tried to give a polite smile, but i'm sure the surprise and wave of awkwardness i was experiencing made that creepy too. i shuffled past them and am now hiding at my desk. i'm sure it's just a matter of time before ""the new guy"" is rebranded as ""the multiple personality weirdo who talks to himself."" shit.

so it has been a while since my previous update, and i wish i could tell you all that it's because we were involved in a super exciting court battle (""no, you're out of order!"") but the truth is much more annoying and banal, as life tends to be. 

as we left it in the last post a couple months ago, our lawyer called the law firm who submitted the action against our property and said ""you have no grounds for this, take it off."" the paralegal he spoke to said the lawyer handling the case was out that day but would contact our lawyer soon.

they did not. for weeks. despite everyone bugging them, they were very disinterested in resolving the issue. color me shocked.

in the meantime, we're getting junk mail from law firms and mortgage management companies at least every 2-3 days, saying they can help us with this issue we don't have. the notices start to be addressed to us personally instead of the this other random guy who said he owned our house. this displeases us. i start keeping a little pile of these letters next to the stairs with copies of our mortgage payments notices from the bank, just in case.

this goes on for a while, long enough for my initial (!!!!!!!) anxiety to fade into more of an ""eh."" situation. until yesterday. 

our lawyer finally got a response to his email from july, where he outlines everything and attached a preponderance of evidence showing we continue to own our house, and their response is, and i quote : ""we will remove the action."" period. no good afternoon, no sincerely. we will remove the action. a shart of an email after weeks of worry.

so with a whimper, we got what we wanted. obviously we will continue to monitor everything until they actually do what they said they will, but it is a load off my mind. i wish i had something more exciting to tell you, but it seems in the legal world, exciting = bad.

thank you all for your concern, your advice, and your upvotes. i hope that if any of you face a similar situation, that reading this can help you figure out how to resolve it.

i clean for private residences in my local area. a year ago, a favorite client of mine's grandson ""mark"", a 22 year old that lived with my client, accused me of stealing money from their home. $150 to be exact. i was eventually charged with theft, and facing up to 2 years in jail and huge fines!! i have a clean record, and it was his word against mine. so i fought it, and would not accept a plea bargain. for the last year, i've had to report to the court house monthly and sit in the courtroom next to dozens of others and reiterate that i would not accept a plea bargain. my public defender would really lay it on thick too. he would say things like, sure it's awful to plead guilty to something you didnt do, but you know whats worse? being in jail for something you didnt do. he would pressure me with the what-ifs of standing trial and the verdict is basically a coin flip. i was never so afraid in my life! but in life, you are given opportunities to either fight or surrender.. and even though the sacrifice here was my freedom, the alternative was my dignity. so we finally have a trial date set and about 2 days before i went in to pick my jury, my public defender calls me with news-the prosecution is dropping the charges and making a motion to nullify!! what?! i damn near fell backwards!! gone. all that stress, all that needless anxiety..gone! in hindsight, looking into the matter, many prosecutors do not want to actually go to trial with most cases. they want you to plea out so it's over and done with. but i stood my ground, and in my case, it worked out to my advantage. i wish the rest of you the best, thanks for everything, special thanks goes to u/justnilt for being so helpful!",2
"circumcision is child abuse and should land you in prison. outside of the obviously incredibly rare life threatening scenarios, performing surgery on a literal newborn baby for anything that's not medically necessary should land you in prison, circumcision being the biggest one.

it's such a widespread norm that literal mutilation of a newborn isn't even a shocker. imagine just taking out an eye, or half his tongue, baby crying because he just entered the world and already being torn apart, but it's religious views!

i have nothing against people who are adults and became circumcised as an adult. go for it but do whatever the hell you want to your body.

"remember to regularly audit your subscription services! you may be letting anywhere from $5 to $20 slip out of your wallet each month. this video about the hidden costs of monthly subscription services(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ndzao7hsnk) by the wall street journal just popped up on my youtube recommended videos list. 

ironically, the top comment is from someone joking about how they need to cancel their digital subscription to the wsj(https://i.imgur.com/gbv7qwg.png)!

this video prompted me to do a self-audit, generating a master list of all my monthly subscriptions and annual fees (excluding things like my electric bill, internet, cell phone, etc.). seems like a good exercise for most people to try.

**monthly subscriptions:**

1. **cocofloss**, $7/month for two packs - premium floss that has motivated me to floss every day
2. **spotify family**, $15/month - shared with my siblings/spouses-in-law, so the net cost to my immediate family is $6
3. **new york times**, $4/month  - i recently got a 6 month promo rate for digital access, but honestly i rarely have time read the news....i might end up canceling this!
4. **netflix**, $0/month for now.....using my friend's account for free! i dogsit for him occasionally, so it's a good barter system. even before the rate hike, i was tired of paying each month for this.
5. **ring doorbell 2**, $0/month because i refuse to pay for storage when companies like wyzecam (which we use as a travel baby monitor) offer cloud video storage for free
6. **google drive**, $1.99/month for 100gb of additional storage (my s/o works in design and needs a reliable cloud backup service. we all have pixels, so this is pretty seamless integration)

**annual fees:**

1. **hyatt credit card**, $79/year - gets us one free night in a category 1-4 hyatt property each year....this is our third year with this card and it easily pays for itself
2. **costco membership**, $55/year - honestly we might cancel this one -- we can get almost everything from target/amazon, and we don't eat that much lol) 
3. **amazon prime**, $119/year - split between my family. my dad is the primary account holder, and we only pay $30/year
4. **aaa**, $100/year - mostly a peace of mind thing at this point. i've needed towing once in the last few years. i don't know if my spouse has ever utilized their services. maybe i could use more of their discounts on other services -- i heard they do museums?

"there's a little-known legend about attila the hun.... the story goes that attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. he particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. he was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.


but his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.


wishing to save his prized pet, attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. none of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.


attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.


but the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. enraged, attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.


standing before attila, the old man calmly said, ""before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me.""


curious, attila did as he asked.


then the old man took some bread and gave it to attila.


""now hold these in both hands,"" he instructed.


attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.


to an amazed attila, the old man simply said,

"i got caught masturbating by my friend's little brother while at her house. i was at their house taking with her and her family and oh boy it was getting boring. 

i decided to head over to the washroom and one thing led to another so i decided to start masturbating. 

i was wearing a short dress so all i did was take my underwear off, seat myself and go at it. i thought i had locked the door but turns out i hadn't. thought the knob thing turned all the way but i guess it didn't lock it. 

worst part? the toilet itself faces the door, so her little brother opened it up and saw everything because i had my legs spread on either side of the toilet. the door doesn't creak at all so i pretty much hadn't noticed until the door hit the door stopper and made a noise. so the little dude probably saw a good (almost) 10 seconds of me just going at it. 

obviously at that point i had stopped and talked with him for a minute and not to say anything. we had dinner afterwards. he stared at me. i stared at him. and every time someone asked him something or asked him what's new with him, i was shaking.  

i don't think i can go over to her house without having the awkwardness from knowing that her brother isn't forgetting this anytime soon. i've gone there some times after and once, the dude even reminded me to lock the door ffs. 

1) always lock the door and if you're going to masturbate, do it at your own house. 

2) a kid half your age, isn't forgetting catching a girl masturbating at his friends house anytime soon, so be wary of where you decided to do this.  ",11
"california i cancelled tattoo appointment because the tattoo artist was high af. they're slandering me on fb and refuse to pay back safety deposit. i had an appointment for a huge tattoo that was estimated at about 2000$. when i made the appointment everything seemed fine and professional, and i made a safety deposit of 500$ which is not at all unusual.

when i turned up to the appointment a month later, i noticed the artist was super stoned (red eyes, reeking of weed, slurred speech...) to the point that i didn't feel comfortable getting tattooed by him. i requested a new appointment with another artist. the lady at the reception didn't understand my problem, became insulting and refused to offer me either my safety deposit back or a new appointment. finally she called somebody else (higher up the chain apparently) on the phone who confirmed they would transfer the deposit back to my account. stupidly i assumed the problem was resolved and left.

not only didn't they not transfer it back, they proceeded to make an angry post on their facebook page about how 'some people' just cancel appointments without notice and then have the 'audacity' to demand their money back. for a few minutes the post included a link to my name until they presumably deleted it.

"my (29/f) sister (33/f) got divorced over her refusal to keep working. she's still unemployed and is mad at me for refusing to live with her and support her financially. (i'm posting this anonymously because i don't want this on my main reddit account).

my sister (33/f) used to be married. i (29/f) am single and have never been married. a year ago my sister's ex-husband (38/m?) filed for divorce and left her. the reason he divorced her was because she had wanted to quit her job and be a stay at home mom to my nephew, who was 3 at the time. they both worked full-time and they had a housekeeper come once a week and a part-time nanny for their son. my sister didn't want to do any household chores when she was staying home and still wanted to keep the housekeeper and nanny. without her salary the couldn't afford it and she said her husband could work a second 20 hour a week job on top of the full-time job he already had. she also wanted to spend exactly the same. her husband wasn't on board with this and he didn't want her to just up and quit her job. she quit once day anyways and only told him after the fact. he filed for divorce.

in the divorce my sister wanted alimony even though the law didn't really call for it in that situation. since she was able to work and walked out on her job by her choice, the court counted this against her. she was not awarded alimony because of that and because she earned the exact same amount as her ex-husband. the court also awarded them 50/50 shared legal and physical custody of my nephew. the courts preferred method was one week on and one week off but they can do whatever they want as long as the time is split equally. my sister has to have him on mother's day and her ex-husband on father's day and holidays and his birthday are alternated by year. since the time is equally split and their income and earning was always the same (ie her ex-husband wasn't a lot richer than her) neither of them has to pay child support to the other. the court counted my sister's former job and the fact there was nothing stopping her from working as income that she was making.

they didn't own a home or property and they rented. her ex-husband kept putting money in the bank account and paying the bills so his son would be okay and so his credit wouldn't be affected. the lease is up on the last day of march and it isn't paid beyond that. my sister has no job and can't afford the apartment so she has to move. her ex-husband is no longer giving her money since the divorce became final.

my sister hasn't looked for a job. she lost her appeal to the courts ruling for alimony and child support. she wants to live with me and for me to financially to support her.

our parents are in their 60s and recently sold their house, paid off any debt they had and moved into an apartment for active seniors. it is small but nice. their siblings and both sets of our grandparents live in similar kind of apartment buildings. our cousins also live in either apartments or condos and are married with more than one baby/child. they don't have any room for her. our parents have enough left from their house sale and pensions to afford their rent/bills for the rest of their lives but they are not super rich and can't afford to support my sister.

i am single. i am working towards my phd and will have it in a few months. i was living with 2 other phd students who just finished theirs. one got engaged and moved in with her boyfriend. the other got a job offer overseas. i found a small bachelor apartment for myself. my sister is mad that i didn't chose a bigger place so she could move in with me. she also wants me to support her financially once i complete my phd and start working.

how do i get her and my family off my back. i don't want to live with her. she has a college degree and there is no reason she can't work beyond her being lazy. i am not worried about my nephew because her ex-husband is the best and most devoted father ever and will step in if she isn't looking after him. she said she will find a rich husband but her parenting and divorce settlement says neither of them can introduce any new boyfriend or girlfriend to my nephew or have an overnight visitor if my nephew with them without permission from a judge. how do i get my sister and family (parents, aunts, uncles and cousins) to stop asking me to live with her (even temporarily). my sister was never this much of an idiot before she quit her job. she is fully able to work and i don't want to support her. 

tl;dr my sister's husband divorced her because she quit her job and refused to work. now my sister wants me to financially support her and my family wants me to live with her at least. how do i get them off my back?

"for feeding my vegan nephew meat?. my sister has been vegan for many years and she is also raising her son vegan. he has been vegan since birth. my nephew and son attend the same school so i pick them up from school everyday. my nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. 

i usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. a couple of months ago i left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew & son sharing chicken nuggets. i provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. i told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. his friends share their meals with him sometimes. i thought about telling my sister but decided not to. 

so basically i continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. usually he goes for the non vegan one. maybe because because he never gets to at home. i know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. she's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which i completely understand and respect. my husband thinks iata for not telling her and being dishonest, but i think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year).

"genuinely caring about somebody a lot, does not guarantee they care about you equally (or at all) in return. some people will never care about you regardless of what you do or say. so don't assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them.. this is something that i unfortunately didn't learn until well into adulthood - it may sound obvious when its spelled out, but when you're in the actual situation its not always so clear.  most of my life i thought if i really cared about somebody a lot, then they must care about me to some degree in return. it always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual, even if the obvious signs showed otherwise. despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating, i would do everything i could to make them happy. i would go out of my way to help them, say & do nice things for them, encourage them, etc..with the assumption they'd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives.  i'd think ""how could they not care about me when i make it so obvious how much i care about them? if i just keep trying they'll come around"".  this was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past, but weren't anymore.

what i've learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined. the amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back. people can and will use you and your emotions. and just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past, doesn't mean they still do now or ever will again in the future...theres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words. 

i'm not talking about classic ""nice guy"" syndrome. not the crush who friend-zoned you that you're desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin with...i'm talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with. whether that be friends, family, or romantic partners.

i wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions. i'd be convinced i could win people over (or back over)...including bad friends and former relationships...if i was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known. looking back i should have cut my loses far sooner. i should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me, but wanted to make me happy in return.

its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for them.you can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do.

*********

**edit** i should note, i don't mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return. there is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy (even if they don't appreciate it). but you can't expect them to some day change their minds. and you shouldn't let your desire to please people who don't care about you distract you from finding people who do.",8
"things teens should know about how their parents may steal from them. i' m a parent of a grown up adult that we always treated fairly. she always kept money she earned and gifts and on her 18th birthday, we encourage her to change her custodial account to hers alone and we never obtained credit in her name.

under 18, you're kinda screwed if parents get their hands on money intended for you. the best thing to do is to keep them from getting it in the first place. if you have generous relatives that give you monetary gifts, there are a few things you can do to try to accomplish this. since these relative are giving you gifts, that means they care about you. try to develop a good relationship so that you can have direct and honest discussions with them. that means engaging them during family visits and treating them respectfully. often, if your parents are financially irresponsible, other family members may not be aware.  i wouldn't recommend telling grandma you parents are gambling away your birthday present, but you should try to point out that you are not receiving the gifts they intend for you.

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

first, for small amounts, you can request that the relative create a **""joint minor account""** in their name and your name rather than giving the money to you directly.  a typical minor account must have an adult and a child as the holders, but the adult does not have to be a parent.  if only you and your aunt are holders of a joint account, your parents cannot legally withdraw money from that account.

&#x200b;

if a relative is giving you a large gift, you may want to ask them to create a **""custodial account""** in their name and your name. custodial accounts are regulated by **universal transfer to minors acts (utma)** in most states.  a custodial account is controlled by the adult and the beneficiary usually cannot withdraw money until they are 21, but only the custodian can withdraw money prior to the beneficiaries 21st birthday, so parents cannot withdraw from the account. custodial accounts can also be created for securities and inheritances.

&#x200b;

you could ask them to change the way they give you gifts in thank you note. for example:

&#x200b;

dear uncle bob,

thank you for the birthday gift of $100. i would love to tell you i used it to buy a nice gift, but actually mom took the check to save for when i'm grown up. i'm not really sure she is keeping very good track of your gifts and i think she probably used the money to buy a pair of manolo blahniks. would you consider opening a minor account in your name and my name so that your gifts will end up benefiting me personally? an account at a credit union usually has no fees for a minor account and is easy to open.

&#x200b;

that way you can make a gift into the account and i can use it when i am 18.  i hope you won't mention this to mom because she is sensitive about discussing how she keeps track of your gifts with me.

&#x200b;

please let me know so i can give you my information needed for an account.

&#x200b;

your neice,

roberta

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

a few things could happen.

uncle bob will open an account for you and you will ultimately be able to access the gifts when you are older.

or

uncle bob will stop sending your mom $100 for your birthday.

or

uncle bob may tell your mom and she will be mad and she will continue to keep your money, but this is how things are going now, right?

"by putting a dildo in my gun case (nsfw). this happened a couple weeks ago...

my aunt and sister-in-law came to visit my neck of the woods, but i'd just returned from a business trip and hadn't been home yet when we met up. they wanted to see my new apartment, so we headed over to my place. i went back to my bedroom to change out of the airplane clothes (i can't be the only one who does this, right?), and notice i'd left a purple vibrator on my bedside table (my husband had jokingly purchased the brightest, most obnoxious purple vibrating eggplant he could find, because we're apart a lot for work and he laughs at my affinity for purple). i went to put it away just as my sister in law walked into my bedroom. having family see you holding a vibrating jelly stick strikes me as odd, so i ducked down and went for the first concealing item i saw: my pistol case. i quickly and snugly tucked the vibrator in the foam-lined case alongside my pistol, stuffed it under the bed and went on my merry way. no harm, no foul, no weird looks at thanksgiving.

a few days later, i'm headed to the gun range for some target shooting. i grabbed my guns, some ammo, and headed out. it was such a quick and seemingly insignificant moment with the vibrator, i'd forgotten about stuffing it into the pistol case (the gun is purple, too, btw). i arranged everything on the table, and opened my gun case. in what seemed like slow motion, i opened the gun case -- the dildo, uncomfortably stuffed alongside the pistol, rolls out of the case, perfectly bumps something (the table, i assume?), starts vibrating, and comes to a rest on the floor. past the table. this means, ladies and gents, that it's past the area you can go; there is a purple vibrating dildo lying amongst the spent brass shells. while i was in my own lane, there were 15-20 people in the other lanes. for the briefest moment, recognition seemed to fill the area as the gun range fell silent... 15 people watching the hapless dildo vibrate and twist it's way across the shooting range. fortunately, it was only a couple feet past the table, so i grabbed the broom intended for sweeping shells, pulled it back under the table, turned it off, and threw it away. looks like i have to find a new range now...  

tl;dr - in trying to hide a dildo, i put it in a gun case and proceeded to spill it onto a public gun range. ",4

"update: my 20/m girlfriend 19/f has an incest fetish and wants me to pretend that she's my sister during sex. original thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bj0hpb/my_20m_girlfriend_19f_has_an_incest_fetish_and/

after reading the comments in the original thread, it really made me wonder if she was intentionally trying to look like my sister for the sake of her fetish. it never crossed my mind after she admitted her fetish to me until i read the comments. the thought of that made me even more uncomfortable than before, so i decided to question her intentions.

i sat her down again and asked her if copying my sister's look was part of her fetish. she said she was really embarrassed but admitted to me that it was. i told her thank you for being honest with me, but that i am really weirded out by it. she said she understands why it weirds me out and apologized for not telling me sooner.

after she apologized, i told her that i'm okay with her fetish and that i'm willing to try roleplaying with her, however there will be conditions for it. my conditions are that she changes her makeup style and dyes her hair a different color, or goes back to her natural color, so that i don't feel like i'm having sex with my actual sister. she agreed without any hesitation and said that it was fair for the both of us, thankfully.

since that conversation, she has dyed her hair back and has started learning different makeup styles independently from my sister. we haven't tried the roleplaying thing out yet, but i feel comfortable with the idea of it now, so i don't think it will be a problem.",7
"for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?. tl;dr at bottom

okay so i'm almost 19.

when my paternal uncle was around 22, he got his girlfriend pregnant, but they had an abortion. they got married later on, converted to christianity and became pro-life advocates, and had two daughters, who are currently 26 and 23. 

i know about the abortion part because my dad told me a couple years back. he didn't say not to tell anyone, but said that only him, his brother, and his wife know of it. i thought it's weird they never told their daughters, given that they're all such protestors against abortion.

but anyways dad also has a sister, who's daughter i'm really close with. she's christian like the rest of us, but she got pregnant out of wedlock and had a baby last may. then her boyfriend left her over it. i absolutely adore her baby, and i try to help raise him given that he doesn't have a father.

i'm usually on good terms with my aforementioned uncle's daughters, and i was messaging them three way last night. i was sending a bunch of cheery pictures and messages of the baby, and eventually they asked why i would celebrate him so much given that he was created in sin.

i told them our cousin has prayed for forgiveness and that everyone makes mistakes. but they overrode me, saying that she's easy and shouldn't have spread her legs blah blah blah. it went on for a few more messages.

i got really frustrated at one point and in a fit of rage said 

""yeah i hate to break it to you ladies but your parents got pregnant and had an abortion all outside of marriage way back when. everyone makes mistakes and our cousin is trying to make the best of a bad situation, so lighten up.""

three hours later and there was still no response; i knew i was in deep shit.

and i was! my parents yelled at me, grounded me, and took away my electronics last night, meaning i'm using my old old old phone right now. they were very tense with me today. i was very earnest. 

i always like posting online where no one can physically judge me, so thus i ask, for telling my cousins the truth about their parents?

tl;dr: uncle and aunt got abortion way back when, told unbeknownst cousins about it when they judged our cousin for having baby out of wedlock, parents mad at me. aita?",3
"for not teaching a skill to my oldest son that i taught his siblings because of the custody arrangement?. edit/update:

the moderators have been kind enough to let me update my post.

i know many, many people have asked about the skillset i mentioned. i just can't be specific because it'll make my younger kids' company identifiable with a quick search. i will say it's nothing mysterious and is a combination of woodworking, metalworking and some masonry sometimes. it's just a niche product and not many people do it. the tools and techniques are unorthodox.

i spent a lot of time reflecting yesterday after reading everyone's comments.

i have talked to my younger kids and i explained to them that even if they aren't happy with how their brother approached it, it's clear he feels left out from our family and it's all our responsibilities to help fix this.

they agreed to extend the offer of apprenticeship again to their brother where he works and learns as a salaried employee. but they've made it clear that no ownership can be transferred after he's put in at least three years of work like they have. i actually think this is generous because they are paying a salary that they don't need to.

however, i'm not sure if my oldest will go for this. he is feeling some sort of way about working for his brothers, not with them.

i reached out to a teacher in alaska who i know casually. he might do me a favor and take on an apprentice. 

i need to scrounge up some money and see if i can send my son there. but again, it's alaska and i'm not sure if my son will be receptive.

i don't know what else i can offer at this point. my wife is disgusted that we've become that family that is fighting about money. she wants to force the twins to give a stake in the company to their brother but i really think it's a bad idea. they need to fix their conflict first or it'll just be a disaster. i don't believe we should be telling our younger kids on how to run their company.

i'll be meeting my son this friday for dinner. i hope he'll be ok with at least one of the options.

i also need to talk to my parents to stop creating more issues. they've always enjoyed chaos and like pitting people against each other. it's not helping.

thanks everyone.


this is the original story:

this has quite literally fractured my family.

i have an older son from my first marriage who's now 24. i have two younger kids from my current marriage who are 21 year old twins.

my divorce occurred right after my son was born. 

over the years, my visitation has been primarily summers and holidays since my ex-wife moved to a different state.

i have a particular skillset i'm was very good at. and all three of my kids have expressed interest in it. unfortunately, i have only been able to meaningfuly teach it to my younger kids.

this was because to make my visitation with my older son more memorable, i would do camping/vacations etc. i didn't have time to teach him properly.

also, anything i did try to teach him was forgotten and not practised because he lived in an apartment with his mother.

the major issue now is that my younger kids have started a company after highschool using this skill. i provided the initial funds and as such have a 33% stake in it. this company has really soared this past year and it's making a lot of money.

my older son graduated from college and is doing a job he hates and is not exactly making a lot of money. especially compared to his siblings.

part of this is my fault because he did ask to take a few years off after highschool and maybe have me teach him what i knew but my wife was battling cancer at the time and i told him i couldn't.

and now, i'm not well enough to teach anymore.

he is now telling me to include him in this company as a equal partner. that he'll do the finances.

this was not received well by his siblings who say they do basically 95% of the work. and that he didn't struggle in the earlier years to get it running.

i'm really at a loss here. i thought of just giving my share of the company to my oldest son but it does seem unfair to his siblings who started this company in the first place.

my oldest has become very bitter about this and has involved my parents. they are taking his side and now my younger kids are resentful that their grandparents have been turned against them.

our sunday family lunches are no longer happening and i'm having to see my oldest for dinner on other days. and everytime i see him i'm getting accused of not treating him fairly. it kills me because i made so many compromises to have him in my life in a meaningful way.

he accused me on saturday of pushing him out my new family and loving his siblings more. i haven't been able to sleep since.

should i have done all this differently?",3

"by losing track of where my dog is.. throwaway account so imma get very pissed if this gets a lot of points.

so i live with my family and my dog spends her nights in my room which means walking her in the mornings is usually my responsibility. this morning (obligatory this actually happened today) i went downstairs and open the door to let the dog out first before putting on shoes and grabbing my keys, in case she was bursting to go (i got up quite late since i graduated high school and pretty much just lounge about helping out at home) she can do it outside rather than in the house. by the time i'd gotten ready though the dog was nowhere to be seen.

now i wasn't too concerned since she can't get past the locked gate, so i knew she wasn't lost. after searching the garden i figured she must have done what she needed to do, and snuck back in to get another nap in (she's a lazy pupper). i went back inside and, since the rest of the house was still asleep (or so i thought), i didn't want to yell for her, so i resorted to check each room.

so the sleeping arrangements in my family is kind of unusual. i have a small sister who doesn't like to spend the night alone, so she chooses a parent to spend the night with in the double bed, while the remaining parent is ""banished"" to her room with the twin size bed, i get my own room. after checking the dog is not in mine or the small bedroom, i figured she'd gone to snuggle with my sister and dad in the big bedroom, so i went in to drag her out because _dammit_ i was determined to get my morning walk.

in i went, and it took me about 30 seconds to realise my mistake: the silhouette in the single bed had been way too small to be my mum. they must have gotten up, carried my sleeping sister to her own room, my mum snuck in with my dad, because there they were, on the double bed, _going at it_

turns out 30 seconds wasn't fast enough to piece the story together because just as i realised and panicked and tried to leave, my mum looks up and we make solid eye contact while i'm pretty sure my dad's dick was still inside her (not that i was keen to verify or think about it). i was catatonic as this point and my brain shut down and i just turned on my heels and left, with a deadpan expression this whole time.

my sister is no longer allowed to sleep in the big bedroom. and yes, turns out the dog was indeed in the room at the time.

tl;dr: let my dog slip into my parent's bedroom, went in to get her, broke my 18 years streak of managing to avoid catching my parents in the act of producing more siblings for me.

edit: let the records show that the first thing i did after getting tf out of that room was to check on my sister (who was awake by this time) and tell her to leave our parents alone for a while.",4
"for naming my dog askim?. 8 years ago i got a gorgeous chug. while extremely high i decided that the greatest dog name ever thought of is askim, because when people ask me his name and i tell them about 50% of the time they'll awkwardly bend down and ask my dog it's name. it's hilarious. 
i had my fun for the first few weeks but eventually everyone had just gotten used to the name and the joke faded away. occasionally i'll be chatting to someone that hasn't met askim yet and when they ask his name i have my little laugh but other than that it's a dead joke. 
well, i just moved into a new neighborhood with a great park that has lots of dogs and very chatty regulars. an elderly lady asked askim's name, said ""what?"" so i repeated myself and she turned to my dog and asked him his name. i quickly explained but instead of getting the usual chuckle she became extremely upset and felt very humiliated. since then a couple of people at the park have approached me and told me they ""heard about my joke"" and that they didn't appreciate pranks in a nice family park.

i honestly don't get it, but since the people that have reacted well to my dog's dumb name have been friends, coworkers and family and these strangers are having a very different reaction i'll accept your judgement on it.

edit: it's a always a little jarring to wake up to 650+ notifications, i'll go through them at my own pace throughout the day.

i should have been clearer, but i guess i didn't know how to spell it out until i saw you guys suggest it. i absolutely think that the reason for her reaction is that i made her feel foolish, and she undoubtedly thought i did that intentionally. this is a pretty close knit community and she sought support from her friends who just took her distress at face value and confronted me about it.

the truth is that i say the word ""askim"" multiple times a day. i'm aware that the name originated in a joke but at this point it's just a thing i call my dog. when going out i'm not looking for new victims or inviting people to get tricked, and i wasn't trying to trick her, it was small talk and i didn't even  think about it until i got a negative reaction. 

it's been pointed out that elderly people can feel really insecure about their diminishing faculties and i know from personal experience that it's very true. i really like the idea of posting an explanation on the community facebook page, especially now that i know it's turkish meaning and that it's a town in norway and neighborhood in sweden.",3

i made dinner and put  frozen on  to get her to sit with me on the couch. it was so awkward. she still wouldn't look at me.

i finally got her to open up. i apologized to her for having seen what she saw. i asked her what she thinks she saw...... all she asked was why was bf hurting me?. i explained that bf and i were just wrestling and i was upset that i lost. then she goes to ask why was i screaming then? (i was wishing lightening would strike me). i told her that i was mad cause i was losing. she bought it.. thank god. poor thing got freaked out because she thought bf was hurting me. i texted him and asked him to call me and apologize to me for 'hurting' me. he did and i put on speaker phone and he apologized. she felt so much better after that. she was back to her self again after that. we finished the movie and i gave her cough syrup and put her to bed. disaster avoided!

i did call and tell my parents. they were shocked. i haven't come out to them yet and they were unaware that my 'friend' was  actually my bf that i've been seeing for a year. as for the sex part.... before they could yell, i apologized  and promised them it won't happen again. and i reminded them of the time i came home from school when i was 16 and caught them in the act on the kitchen island.  that got me out of trouble. i wasn't grounded or noting. they did ask if they could meet him sometime next week (he also wants to apologize to them).

today was a good day. saved my sister's childhood, came out to my parents, had sex- got caught and didn't get in trouble , and parents want to meet my bf.

lesson learned. if i want to be intimate with him again, i'll go to his apartment.

"i forged my way through grade 11 physics.. so i've always been a good student, like high 90s. i was doing well in 11th grade physics, but got an 80 on a test which severely impacted my average. we weren't allowed to take tests home, so i snuck into the teacher's desk at lunch and grabbed mine, i scanned it and created a blank test using photoshop. then, i filled it out more or less properly and then matched the teacher's handwriting as best as i could and marked everything correct, but then wrote a wrong total on the front. i then asked to see the test the next day. i pointed out that there was an adding error. she apologized and corrected it, i then had a 98 ( can't be too good). this worked so well i did it on another 2 tests and even on the final before she entered the marks. probably wouldn't do it again, but it did work.

edit:

wow, this blew up!
so story is a bit embellished. it was only a drastic change on the first one, the later tests was a difference of 2 or 3 percent (95 to 97/98). the teacher kept tests in a filing cabinet where each student had a folder with their tests. i asked to see my tests and just put the folder back hoping she wouldn't notice a test was missing. i then asked to see it again when we had class after lunch and just put the test back into the folder and pointed out the mistake. in all seriousness, i probably deserved a mark like 2 percent lower, but oh well. i also don't condone this, some teachers might be more attentive in terms of their handwriting. i mostly was just curious if it would work, didn't really need the extra percentage. i also don't know how to use photoshop, i used paint.net.",11

"my 16f mom 36f acts ""competitively"" around me since i lost weight.. hi reddit, 


so this is a weird one probably, i've always been a quite chubby child, but around a year and a half ago i've decided to do something about that and started working out and doing other sports, i'm playing volleyball and i'm in my high schools cheerleading team. 

around like 8 months ago my mom has started acting like i'm some sort of ""threat"" to her relationship with my stepdad 41m.

yes, i've catched my stepdad staring at me few times and i think that's kinda gross but i had hoped she would talk to him about that, but instead she is mad at me.


at first she started teasing me with the fact that i'm lesbian, something she never really had an issue with before, said that i'm still the ""chubby"" girl and other mean things. 

over time it has only gotten worse to the point where there are some serious restrictions on what i'm allowed to wear. for example, we've a pool, she absolutely doesn't want me to go swimming in it, because she doesn't want me to walk around in a swimsuit or a bikini. 

i'm not allowed to wear my gym clothes or any form of leggings, skirts or dresses or even my cheerleading outfit. 

at multiple occasions she has tried to hide or throw away clothes or make-up. including lululemons i've paid for with my own money. 

she always asks me when i'm getting a haircut again and tries to pressure me into my old short hairstyle by saying how unattractive my longer hair looks. (fun fact: we are both blonde and have similar hair lengths)

ding. you guessed it. 50k. 

when asked this question in an interview, do not give a number instead reply with something along the lines of...

interviewer: ""now, what would you say your salary expectations are?""
you: ""i would just expect to be paid fairly for the experience and skills that i bring to the table"" 

if they press further - tell them ""i would be remiss to give a number because there are many aspects that go into overall compensation and i would need to be able to compare all aspects of it.""

this is a completely true statement as bonus, stock, health insurance, 401k, hsa, pto and education reimbursement are all elements of a potential compensation plan.


edit: i realize that there isn't a one size fits all approach to this. if you know exactly what you are worth and have confidence in that number, all the power to you to give an accurate and informed number to hr. it is in your best interest to try to negotiate up as much as you can, and many hr reps will try to get good talent for low cost to the company. it definitely is a negotiation. i would argue that the majority of people do not know exactly what their range is, and yes research is key here, but doesn't always lead to the employee being confident in a number they should be getting paid. i think many people do do themselves a disservice by undervaluing their talent and come in low. that could be due to lack of research, lack of confidence, lack of negotiation skills etc. one way to combat this for people that are newer to interviewing and don't have a good sense of were they fall on that spectrum, is to try to abstain from giving a number. that's all my point was about.

edit 2: i regret making this as an ultimatum. went for effect and definitely got it. this doesn't apply to everyone. there are situations that giving a number is advisable. also getting a lot of comments on online applications, and from hr or hiring managers railing against this idea. i appreciate all of the responses, difference in opinion, even the rude ones. good to gain perspective on my part.",10
"three companies, including my bank, don't know where my money went. they're all redirecting me to each other.. **background:** several weeks ago i accidentally purchased a $100 starbucks e-gift card through the chase.com website on my computer browser. i wanted to send my sibling a belated gift of direct money. within 2-5 minutes of sending the money and realizing my mistake, i called chase and starbucks to cancel the transaction. chase said they could not cancel it because the transaction was already completed and $100 had been debited from my checking account. a representative from starbucks redirected me to cashstar (the third-party company in charge of e-gifts). the cashstar representative cancelled the transaction. 

i was supposed to refunded my $100 a month ago, but i have not seen my money yet. this is the summary of what has happened.

**chase:**

* their transaction history confirms that the money was debited from my account and sent out. 
* they have not received any confirmation of any refunds or money returned, so as far as they are concerned, the money was released and cannot refund the money.
* i spoke to a branch associate who sat down with me for about 2 hours on the phone with cashstar and starbucks who both confirm that they never received the money because they cancelled the transaction/e-gift card -- ""chase must be responsible.""
* chase internal investigation and claims division ""investigated"" the matter and deemed they cannot refund me the money. the money was sent out and that's the only record they have. but they never contacted anyone outside of chase - and they refuse to.
* chase directs me to starbucks/cashstar because they ""must have received"" the money.

**starbucks:**

* the transaction happened online through chase's platform so contact them.
* the transaction was for an e-gift card so contact cashstar, because they handle online/e-gift card transactions.
* starbucks records show that the card was cancelled and never processed.
* starbucks has no record of money coming in.

**cashstar:**

* transaction and card number only yield an empty and unactivated card. 
* cashstar cannot see if money came in, only that it was cancelled.
* cashstar claims that they do not see or handle any of the money directly -- i should contact either chase or starbucks.
* cashstar redirects me to chase regarding the refund because the money originally came out of my chase bank account.

**me and my sibling:**

* my sibling and i received the regular e-gift card email with the code to open it, but it never opened and yields only a 404 page. the card doesn't exist.
* i am still missing $100 from my account.
* my sibling never received the $100.


i am at a loss as to where my $100 is. i keep getting redirected around and around and i have spent over 10 hours on the phone and at the chase branch talking to people trying to get my $100 back.

i am sorry to hear about the others who have experienced similarly unresolved issues. i hope we can find a solution to all this.

"for being ok with my parents( and family) not attending my wedding because they won't accept my friend. update: first off i want to say thank you for all the lovely comments, and for people taking the time to weigh in! i tried to keep up with them all and i just couldn't, so i'm so sorry if i couldn't get to your comment! 

just to be very clear, i was not asking if i am asshole for standing up for my friend, i stand by my actions 100%. i am trying to figure out if i should have done more to convince my parents to come rather than simply accepting they won't be there. 

i am going to take the advice many of you have suggested and have another sit down with my parents and reiterate my feelings. i will be firm with them and remind them that they are welcome to come but that if they do i expect them to be kind and courteous to all!


i will do an update when i speak to them, thank you again reddit x

____________________

i (28f) am marrying my fiance (32m) in march.

i was in my parents home recently and i was telling them about our wedding party, which is going to include a male friend of mine as a groomsman. for some background. this male friend, we'll call him stephen, went to high school with me and is a post op trans man. my fiance said he'd love to have stephen as a groomsman, and i asked stephen and he was delighted!

then, i told my parents, and they were like ""oh we didn't realise she (yep, she) was going to be actually in the wedding. she'll be in all the photographs, we don't think that's appropriate""  so i was obviously instantly mad.they then said that they weren't going to be comfortable attending and being in all the photographs with her (yep, her again), and that i would need to remove stephen from the wedding party if i wanted them to come to the wedding. 

so i basically told them that if they weren't comfortable they didn't have to come. i left, came home and immediately transferred them the money for the wedding dress. i then get a phone call from my mother telling me that they will pay for the whole wedding if i remove stephen. basically bribing us. i just told her i needed space and i hung up.

that was 3 days ago and i haven't spoken to them. i'm shocked because they have never spoken ill of stephen before,! i'm upset that they would show so little respect to someone who is so important to me. i am also upset that they have so little respect for me that they think i would turn my back on a lifelong friend for money.

i don't know if i should speak to them in a few days when everything has calmed down, or if i should leave it to them. a few people i've spoken to have said i'm being a bit of an asshole because they're my parents, and they have a right to an opinion even if it's something i don't agree with. that i'll regret them not being at my wedding and that realistically it will ruin our relationship. i've had aunts and uncles calling me saying that this will tear our family apart and i'm being selfish. a cousin texted me to say that i'm choosing friends over family and that she and her parents won't be attending if my parents aren't, and the same for other members of the family. so it's basically blew up into this huge deal where a good portion of my family will likely not attend either! 

my view is that i don't think it's selfish to want to celebrate my day with everyone i love. i feel like the ball is in their court and they have the choice to come or allow their bigotry to stop them attending their only childs wedding! 

also to be clear i am 100% not removing stephen from my wedding or taking the money, i'm not considering either option (my fiance is in full agreement). but i just want to know if i'm the asshole for so easily accepting that my parents (and by default a lot of my family) won't be coming to my wedding?",3
"i'm in high school and my parents can't teach me the basics of money management. to put it simply my parents just aren't great role models when it comes to budgeting, much less saving. they live paycheck to pay check, and spend money recklessly. i know this because i have compared my parents' habits to those of people who are a bit better off (like the helpful advice people leave on this sub lol) we don't live poorly, but definitely not comfortably. no savings, nothing for my future. 

it's just difficult, mainly because i don't really know what to do with the money that i rarely get, other than spend it. i know to save about 20%? but i feel like i could do more. i just need advice for planning for what to do with my money before and when go to college and other expenses when i move out.

i don't have a job currently, but i am planning on getting one. also, i tried looking up money management videos on youtube, but i think that is geared more towards adults.

just any tips or helpful advice would be greatly appreciated. i can also answer questions :)

edit: oh my lord thank you all so so so so so much! i did not expect this in the slightest! i posted this whilst on a road trip i was on, now i am on my way home. i will take time tonight to read every single comment and reply to more! i will update soon! (also i am a girl lol)

edit 2: i have read every single comment, and i know this because my inbox is officially empty (sorry that it took so long!!) i'd like to say thank you to everyone who commented and reached out to me. i am so surprised at the overwhelming support! i definitely have a complete understanding of what i should and shouldn't do. the biggest thing is see (other than saving), is the the self-discipline i should acquire. there are many steps, and i shall, look at each one carefully and consciously. first things first, i am going to read! i am planning on a summer job as well, and i currently babysit regularly. everything should flow very well, and i have tremendous hope because everyone gave me this advice! again, thank you so so so much. you guys are absolutely amazing

"by letting my girlfriend touch my element and mineral collection. yea yea what a nerd, he collects the periodic table.

well i do, it's not the largest but contains some of the more interesting or rare elements. it sits in a display case in my room, and looks like this
https://imgur.com/a/drj8sjr

so the fuck up begins when i order the element cobalt. it has to ship from italy where i get the elements + jars, and it arrived broken.
i emailed them, and they responded in a very wholesome and google translated email(https://i.imgur.com/v5vodvy.jpg) saying they would replace the jar. 

so the jar arrives and i transfer the cobalt sample from some other storage container into it's designated jar. everyone would be fine if it stays in the jar. my girlfriend is at my house at the time, and i hand it to her to put in the display case, which she spends a while at.

 i assume she's looking at some of the cooler samples like gold, platinum, or gallium,  i think nothing of it. later on her hand gets really red and itchy. like reeallly bad. it looks like she stuck her hand into poison ivy.
she's in a lot of irritation and some pain and i think i know the cause.

""did you take the cobalt out of its jar""

""yea i held it and looked at it""

i know she did more than that, probably shook it around in her hand or something.
for those of you who don't know, cobalt has an effect called ""contact dermatitis"" which basically means, you touch it, and it makes you really uncomfortable. once you have one reaction, you'll most likely develop a lifelong allergy. cobalt also known to cause cancer, but only with frequent contact. 

so now her hand was feeling a bit better but it looked terrible. there wasn't much anyone could do, so that sucks for her.
i had to deal with the fact that i handed her a very toxic metal and didn't tell her. yay for me. major fuck up and i'm an idiot. 

tl;dr i handed my girlfriend a toxic metal and she touched it causing a painful reaction and probably gave her a lifelong allergy to it. oh and the metal also causes cancer.

*edit:* ok also i want to to throw this in there, that this probably won't be that much of a problem. she doesn't want to study chemistry, and how many times in your life will you come into contact with elemental cobalt? yea, zero. it would have to be pure elemental cobalt, not alloys. she wasn't mad about it either, we laugh about it.

edit 2: i need to be more specific about the allergy. everyone will have a reaction to cobalt. we are all allergic. but after your first serious exposure, you're significantly more sensitive to it. i didn't really _give_ her an allergy, i just made her more vulnerable to cobalt. also, don't blame her. this is my fault and i should have been more clear. she is a smart person and it's not her fault. this is not ""today someone else fucked up""

edit 3: so more people are expressing interest in element collecting rather than in expressing sympathy for my poor girlfriend. i created a sub, r/collectingelements to start you people up. in case you were curious, here are my current elements and the _cursed cobalt_

"just found out my boyfriend was an incel — reposted from aita. (deleted from so reposting here.)

i met my boyfriend through a local dnd facebook page. we started talking every day over messenger and pretty soon we were meeting up to continue our conversations in person. we had a lot of stuff in common, and i thought he was really funny, and i just enjoyed his company. we started dating and we've been dating for nearly a year. we moved in together in may.

however, yesterday i found out from one of our dnd friends that he used to comment on r/braincels . he brought it up in a ""good for him for moving on"" way but holy fuck. i only knew about incels from the guy that killed all those people a few years back. i managed to get the friend to tell me the account name (he got really uncomfortable and asked me not to tell my boyfriend) and although he never said anything violent, my boyfriend repeatedly called girls derogatory names, said we were inferior, we were whores, we would never date a short ugly man like him, etc. his last post he mentioned that he was talking to a ""foid"" and that she was actually showing interest. i think he meant me.

he was going through a really hard time this past year, not in a good mental place, but i don't think that excuses all the sexist and gross things he said about women. he's never shown any misogyny towards me or anyone else, but how do i know he doesn't still feel that way? would i be the asshole for dumping him over something that happened pre-our relationship? should i give him a chance to explain? i love him and i don't know if i can be objective if he asks me to sympathize with him. but i also don't think i can continue to be with him knowing he things i'm not deserving of the same respect as men.

added info from last post: he's never done anything i consider a red flag, but i also have been blind to warning signs in past relationships, and he never told me about his misogynistic history. i feel like my trust has been breached. 

do i end things? give him the chance to talk? or give him a chance?",7

 it was really easy using a usb keylogger, i only hacked the professors that were really bad at explaining stuff and did not deserve to even teach. from time to time i would help fellow students, but they never knew how i got the tests, they just thought that i got them from other students that have already taken the tests.

got into their email because they would send their tests to be printed by a printing department and i would intercept them.

"for /how/ i told someone i would not give up my handicap spot?. this is a throwaway account.

&#x200b;

for background, i (22f) am very petite, fit, and just by looking at me one would not guess i have a physical disability. 2 weeks ago, i had surgery with incisions on my spine and one butt cheek making walking more difficult temporarily. though, i have a handicap placard not just because i had surgery, but for the overall problem that me to be unable to walk long distances.

i'm not asking for refusing to give up my spot, but because of what i said. my brother thinks i went too far, but i think i afforded the woman the same amount of respect she gave me.

&#x200b;

i was going out to dinner with my brother (passenger seat.) i pulled into one of 4 handicap spots in front of a restaurant and the woman (late 60s) in the car to my right immediately opened her door to block my brother from getting out. we waited a few seconds, and it became clear this was intentional. i got out of the car and asked her if she would close her door.

&#x200b;

the woman immediately started berating me, saying i had no right to use the handicap spot as other people ""that actually need it"" would be unable to park. apparently, i am young and skinny enough to suck it up (though she doesn't know what my disability is) and deal with parking far away. she called me an entitled brat and accused me of ""scamming the government to support \my\ lazy ass,"" among other things. i told her a doctor saw fit i get a handicap placard, and when she said i look ""fine"" i told her that my medical history is none of her business. she continued to insult me, even calling me a lazy bitch at one point, and refused to close her door.

&#x200b;

i eventually had enough and let her have it. i told her something along the lines of, maybe if you didn't eat yourself into debilitating obesity others 'that actually need it' would be able to use your spot. she tried to respond by saying her weight was due to medical issues, to which i cut her off to say if she's going to make assumptions about me i will do the same. i called her a miserable old bitter bitch and told her at her big old age she should have learned to mind her business. she threatened to call the police on me for reasons she was unable to verbalize and i told her to go ahead and pointed to the restaurant we were going to and told her to send them in.

&#x200b;

when my brother heard this he finally crawled out of the driver's side. he said something like calm down and let's go inside, and i said that sounds like a great idea if the nosy bitch will leave us alone, but she seems too fat to follow up with the police and bring them inside. then we walked away with her still yelling things at me with her door open. she either didn't call the police or they refused to come.

&#x200b;

i know what i said was harsh but i'm pretty tired of people making assumptions about my pain and telling me about my pain. maybe i should regret it, but i don't have an ounce of remorse for what i said. aita?",3
"by leaving my facial cleansing brush in my boyfriend's parents bathroom. this happened 2 weeks ago and i've only just stopped cringing entirely when i think about it.

my boyfriend and i were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. i took a shower, and i remember feeling really smug because i remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. for anyone that doesn't know what it is, it's literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. 

after using it, i wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when i had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. it's important to note that i had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the 'head' of it.

anyway, everything's fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and i are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for ""a word"" with my boyfriend. we both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.

after a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says ""why did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?""  obviously i was perplexed, saying i really had no idea what he was talking about. he was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as ""pink with a big bulb"" and then it hit me.

i too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as i explained what it was. unfortunately, i didn't realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. 

""you don't have to lie bloatedrabbit, it's ok but just next time don't leave it around for everyone to see.""

""i swear on my life it's a face cleanser!"" i said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. i handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. my boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he's a dirty old man for thinking like that. his dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when i think about it.

""well i'm sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother's toys!"" 


i'm not religious at all, but when i say i wanted god to beam me up there and then... i'm not kidding. i felt like jumping out the window. the whole energy of the room shifted. his dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn't dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.

worst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. my boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. talk about awkward.

tl;dr i left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend's conservative parents bathroom. his dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend's mum's toys.",4

"i have not eaten out at lunch while at work now for a full 8 days. honestly it's a record. this is obviously not a huge deal for many people in this sub.  i used to be much better about budgeting...life happened and i fell off the rails.  i've realized i have spent roughly $250-300 / month just on personal eating eating out as i made it a habit to grab some food after hitting the gym during my lunch hour.  unless work provided food, i was never bringing food to the office. 

with trying to be better about saving in general, and realizing i haven't contributing anything to my 401k or roth in 18 months...a change needs to happen.  

i know i won't go 5 days / week of never eating out..but i needed to make a change and it doesn't benefit me health/fitness wise particularly but i will figure out a better routine.  i went to the store and bought some healthy pb, organic jelly, and some healthy bread  and decided to just make a sandwich at my desk every day for lunch. my work has various snacks so i will pick at those. i bought a handful of the 90 second uncle ben rice packets as well.  i can take 2 scoops of protein powder with me each day as well.  

i'm not good at prepping my food late at night or in the morning..part of that is bad time management, laziness, and forgetfulness. so making the sandwich with the ingredients in my drawer is sometimes easiest.  

but i know i can certainly have a good use for $200+ / month besides putting it in my stomach.

"by trusting a ""hot local single in my area"" on a dating app.. greatest/worst thing ever just happened to me, so buckle up folks..it's story time:




girl on a dating app tells me in the first few messages that i'm really cute (true) and interesting (also true) and asks me to meet her at 1140am for coffee at a random mcdonald's. when i ask if she's a 45 year old man trying to harvest my organs, she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they're straight from facebook. because that's how you convince somebody you're real (not true).




now normally i don't accept propositions like this because i'm thinking ""what's the catch?"" well, i decide to live a little on the yolo side...and since it's right next to a subway sandwich shop i think that the worst that could happen is it's a 45 year old lonely man, i give him a big hug because i know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man, get a tasty sandwich, then go home. apparently that was not the worst thing that could happen.




i show up. she shows up. she's real. i'm surprised. i buy her coffee because i subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise. she uses her mccafe frequent buyers card so she gets stamps. its cute. while the guy is making her drink, she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun. i go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because i'm a romantic at heart. 5 minutes later. 10 minutes later. 15 minutes later. no girl. i text her the typical guy message ""lol u get lost???"". no response. turns out she took the coffee and left.




so i'm not saying it's bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or aren't attracted to them. it's totally your decision. but i don't think that's the case...i think this girl is a serial mccafe dater. and i don't think this was her first time. it was too professional. too clean. it was the perfect mcheist. and i'm starting to think i'm not even mad...she didn't steal my credit card, or my organs. just a few euros.

(they combined some teams to save money.) i had taken off a total of 3 days in 9 months, all but one were approved in advance. (emergency illness which they made me prove my daughter was at the doctor, which i did prove, which was odd to me. i had 10 days of pto accrued that i never touched.)

i pay $1100/rent, $450/car (paid off in 9 months) and spend $100/month in groceries. i have a personal loan that is paid off in 4 months that's $190/month that can't be set out, i've asked.  i spend next to nothing outside of that. i've sold most of my nice clothes (except for 3 professional interview outfits.) 

what can i do? should i just remove that employer from my experience altogether? is there something else i even can cut back on? i made my rent in 2 payments in february and they said it would be a $50 fee (over the phone) but it ended up being $400 late fee! i don't have any savings. i don't have any credit cards. in february my boyfriend was kind enough to make my car payment. i'm applying to jobs like crazy but now that i know why i've been ghosted.. i just don't know what to do. i've never been unemployed before and it's really starting to impact me mentally. ill continue looking for jobs of course and i miss working. but this is just insane. i need to stay afloat and $1700 a month is not livable for me. 


note: bf is moving in on april 14 and will pay $450/month in rent. 


tl;dr: lost job. income went from $4100 to $1700/month. cut back on phone bill and car insurance. cut out all eating out and entertainment. sold clothes. looking for ways to make ends meet and ideas/insight. i'm just at a loss of what to even do. 


edit: since multiple people are asking and i can't seem to keep up with comments- no child support/alimony/etc. we split all child related bills 50/50 because we make (made) similar income and have split custody. i will be unemployed temporarily and do not want to take money from him. he is a great dad and has brought over a ton of food for her while i look for a job. getting child support would be temporary and i really don't see that as the solution here as it could damage our co-parenting relationship.

edit 2: i'm assuming that the *potential employer* called the *previous employer* to verify employment. they told me the previous employer called them, but it makes a lot more sense the other way around. i agree. i wrote this out based on the info i had.

also-for those of you calling me mental, borderline, bipolar, etc- my mental health is okay. sit down. i am stressed. being home applying for jobs all day can stress you out. i get that my situation is weird. you don't have to believe me- but move along. my life is chaotic and i don't feel like defending myself against you anymore. 

groceries: i only eat veggies. (yes. i make chicken or turkey for my kid. vegetarian is my choice, i don't push it on her but she does love salad.) frozen veggies are cheap. i have so much veggies! and i mostly make curries for me, rice and chicken or noodles and chicken for my kid. she loves ramen. and a side of veggies. so yeah. $100-$120/month. not a typo.

"when buying a car, don't get hung up on silly crap and talk yourself into a worse deal. so i had a customer who really wanted 0% financing on his vehicle. the thing is we didn't have 0% financing offers on the vehicle he wanted. he however did have good credit and and got 2.99% apr. but he said he'd only buy from us if we could offer him 0%

he had a discount on his vehicle of about $3,000 so i emailed a loan officer i work with alot (who had offered him the 2.99%) and i asked her if we wrote their bank a check for $3,000 would they let us buy the rate down to 0%.

long story short the bank said yes, because well $3,000 was more interest (not by a lot, but it was still more) then they would have made at 2.99% and they got all their profit up front.

so we took the $3,000 discount away from the customer, he financed his car at 0% and ended up with a slightly higher payment and walked away feeling like he just won the lottery.

my customer made the critical mistake of getting so hung up, on one little detail he negotiated himself into a worse deal. now at the end of the day, my customer is only going end up paying about $200 more then he would have...but still.

also i did point out to the customer he was in fact paying more for the car at 0% then at 2.99% but he said it didn't matter cause of all the interest he'd save...he didn't get it, i sold a car, life goes on.

"charged nearly $1,000 on my parents credit as a kid on a game.. i was around 11 years old. the game was arcane legends. it was honestly a pay to win game. you could grind for hours every day and play for months and still not even have a character that was as close to as good as a character you could have if you spent real money on the game. me being a kid and being absolutely addicted to this game, i decided it would be a great idea to take my parents credit card one day and sneakily put all of the information into my ipad so i could make the purchases. i came home from school and sat in the car thinking about whether or not i was really going to do this. i really wanted a special set of armor inside of the game so i could be as good as others. i said fuck it. i went into my house and without looking back i charged $950 to my moms credit card. i knew what i was doing was bad but i had convinced myself i had to do it no matter the consequences. i bought the $100 pack of diamonds 9 times, and 1 $50 pack once. the game had a cool down mechanism set up for in game purchases. so after i bought one pack for $100 i had to wait about a minute before i could do it again. so basically i sat on my couch for about 10 minutes charging hundreds of dollars to my moms card. i knew i had fucked up but i didn't even care because 11 year old me got the mythical armor set i had wanted for so long. 

obviously my parents found out within that same day as i had just charged their card $1,000. they saw that the purchases were made on a game and they knew it was me. so i tried to lie myself out of it and tell them how i must have accidentally hit the purchase button without noticing it. i was too ashamed to fully admit what i had done. my parents charged all the money back, and they got it. my account on arcane legends got banned because i still had the armor in game but the money got charged back so it was like i got it for free. i cried because i had put months into this game and it was all gone. i regretted doing this directly after. i eventually started a new account on the game and started to get a good character again, but ultimately i got bored and stopped playing.

used my parents credit card without them knowing to spend $950 on a game called arcane legends to get some armor. parents found out and charged the money back, then my account got banned on the game anyway.",11
"by making a north korea joke to pay my power bill. today i learned that venmo takes the subject of your payment very seriously. 

every month when the power bill comes up, my roommate alerts us of in a comical manner. we've received the star wars title scrawl with the text reworded to describe the bill, the stranger things intro sequence, you get the idea. well this time i get a link to a subtitled north korean news broadcast, link here.(http://www.captiongenerator.com/731812/north-korea-power-bill) so naturally i send my roommate the money via venmo with the subject ""north korea is best korea.""

within seconds, i get a notification in the venmo app that my payment has been halted pending review by venmo's compliance department per office of foreign assets control (ofac) guidelines. there is a 48hr hold on the payment and i'm required to submit a statement of sorts explaining my payment. it's been about an hour and i've already had a phone call with the customer service department that can be summed up as ""can you not??"" 

it would seem that there is a list(http://gawker.com/the-words-that-will-get-you-in-trouble-on-venmo-1738331672) of words that will get you into trouble on venmo, but all the usual jokes about cocaine and hookers are good-to-go. it's been a fun morning.

edit #4: they let the payment go through. at least their cs dept is pretty quick on these things. i hope that video made someone's day at venmo. now back to funding rogue states and terrorist groups. my monthly payments to the kgb and isis are late...

"by trying to inflate my penis like a dick balloon.. this fuck up took place 15 years ago when i was around 11 years old.   i had recently seen my father's penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  it got me thinking about how small my penis was.    i decided i needed to do something about this.   i did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   

now, my 11 year old self didn't really understand what this term meant.  i however knew that i had a penis, which had a hole, and i had a pump.   the pump i had, was a soccer ball pump.   the ones with the little metal needle.  well i examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   i stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   i decided the pain would be worth it.   i pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   it inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   since i was 11, i was not an anatomy expert.   the sensation gave me an erection, so i decided it must be working.  i inflated again.   it hurt a little this time, and now it felt like i had to pee.   i wanted results though, and people always say ""no pain, no game.""   i pushed the handle down again.   now i really fucking had to pee.

i removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   the sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   however, i really fucking had to pee.   i pushed super hard.   no man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  i get to claim that i guess.   the air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   it really hurt my dickhole.   amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    i can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.

15 years later it still hurts when i pee occasionally.  i am considering going to a urologist one day, however i am not sure how to address the issue.   the last thing i would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  

tldr:   i thought my penis was too small so i inflated it like a balloon.    it hurt when i peed.

"i dont own this joke. but i havent forgotten about it for five years.. son: ""dad, i have to do a special report for school. can i ask you a question?""

father: ""sure son. what's the question?""

son: ""what is politics?""

father: ""well, let's take our home for an example. i am the wage earner, so let's call me ""capitalism"". your mother is the administrator of money, so we'll call her ""government"". we take care of your need, so let's call you ""the people"". we'll call the maid ""the working class"" and your little brother, we can call ""the future"". do you understand son?

"my boyfriend ""slut shames"" me because of my post partum body. some background: i used to be very small chested and thin. i also used to wear a lot of dresses and he loved this. last august we had our son, so my body still looked like i was 5 months pregnant until about september when it was sweater weather, so i missed out on my wearing any of the dresses i really liked and he never saw my ""new body"".

since being pregnant, my chest went from a size b to a dd. my body is just generally fuller and i've been feeling self conscious about it for awhile, but he has been encouraging until now. 

on mother's day he bought me a really pretty floral dress. the chest area has a dip that is not over the top, but it does show the tops of my newly bigger boobs. i tried it on and he immediately acted off and told me it would just be an ""around the house"" dress. he has never shamed me before so i figured he thought i didn't like it, so we met up for lunch later and i wore it to show him i did. he blew up telling me how provocative i looked and that i was trying to look ""sexy"" in all the photos with our son and how disgusted he would feel when he looked back at them.
we walked back home and he continued this, every time i walked past a guy he would tell me they must be thinking about how easy i was. he told me that we were going to have to go through my closet and throw away any dresses that make me look like a prostitute. 

i got upset with him and told him i was not dressing to look like a whore and that he needed to accept my body wasn't going to look the same as before, and i couldn't just tuck my boobs away especially in summer heat. he got annoyed and asked if i was actually getting mad over it and we didn't talk for a few hours.

his apology was, ""i'm not saying this to make you feel bad, but, c'mon.""

i don't know what to do as he has never been like this before. i feel so ashamed and humiliated and i'm trying to pretend i am not embarrassed but he has really hurt me but can't see it.

"i 27m don't feel sexually compatible with my fiancee 27f. *(posted from a throwaway account; i'd rather not have this on my posting history. i previously posted it, felt bad and deleted it, but having thought about it again i realise i need to get it off my chest.)*

i'm currently engaged to a girl that i absolutely love, we've been together for the best part of 10 years, and the wedding has been arranged for march. the start of that whole ""*wedding, buying a house and starting a family*"" time. everything is pretty much perfect, apart from one issue: i feel like the bedroom is dead and/or we're just not compatible sexually.

just to get the obvious out of the way:

1. i don't have any ""*extreme tastes*"" or anything like that; we're hardly talking about bdsm! everything involved is distinctively *vanilla* \- i.e tie'n'tease, massages, or a little toy play.
2. yes, we've been together for 10 years; but if i'm feeling this way before we're even married (**and when i'm still in my twenties**) then it genuinely concerns me about the future.
3. i *know* that communications are incredibly important in a relationship, yet it feels like we've discussed this topic before and.. it was pointless. pointless either by her defensiveness, or just for the sheer lack of anything changing.

sex is incredibly important to me - be it for intimacy, pleasure, or both. it just feels like we both have entirely different attitudes though. there are times where i want it slow, so as to savour it and take the most pleasure, there are times where i want it to be intimate and tender, then other times where i may want to be hard and energetic... regardless of these wants though, it's *the same*.

often it feels like she uses friends as comparators - i.e ""*they haven't had sex in months - i dont know how they do that!*"". well to be blunt, i'm not in a relationship with her friends, nor do i have the exact same desires as her friends. other times she may say that i ""*never want normal sex*""; which just isn't true. it makes it sound like she's constantly dressing up or we're doing something exotic; she may put on some stockings 3 or 4 times a year, which i really appreciate... but that's it.

previous chats have been fruitless, so i've tried to communicate in other ways. that's usually meant buying little things we could try - perhaps a couple of toys, or little tie'n'tease restraints. quite often these would be used once or twice, and then thrown in a box to gather dust. so i've now opted for books, *specifically with topics for both me and her*, ranging from intimate massage to oral play. i hope this shows that i don't even care for specific fantasies, i just want to play and have fun, *and i recognise that's a two way street.*

she recently embarrassed me (i think she'd had a couple of drinks at the time, so i didn't say anything.) by talking to friends about one of the items i purchased. she made it sound like it was something exotic, it was a bit of an anti-climax when they realised it was just a wand. yet as i sat there feeling awkward i just realised that i think it's pointless trying to communicate via items or books too, and in combination with words having no effect.. i just feel stuck.

we *have* spoken before about these things, but it never changes anything. she's never really spoken about what *she'd like*, hence me trying to experiment. yet for me, the few turn-ons that i've mentioned - all incredibly vanilla at that (i.e stockings, tie'n'tease/edging, or simply seeing her enjoy herself.) - are just.. well, it feels like they're forgotten immediately after any conversation.

so i'm sitting here genuinely worried about the future; i have someone i love and i want to spend the rest of my life with, but similarly someone i don't feel compatibility with in a very important way. the last thing i'd want to do is to nag her or make her feel pressured; that's not acceptable. yet i'm struggling with how this makes me feel; realistically i'm not bad looking, but i begin to focus on weight i could lose etc. it also changes my perception of her - i then begin to find her less attractive, and go off sex all together as *i simply don't feel fulfilled*. i just feel stuck.",7
"for kissing my ex-girlfriend before her parents pulled her off life support?. about a year ago, my ex-girlfriend (i'll call anna) was involved in a terrible car accident. she received over 20 injuries (lacerated liver, broken ribs, punctured lung, bruised lung, left foot torn off, just to name a few). she had to be flown to the city to receive treatment. i was devastated to  hear her go through this.  despite all the efforts, she was kept on a ventilator (per her parents wishes) and never woke up. 

after months of visiting anna, sitting by her, i was getting drained. her parents eventually told me (in a very kind way) that she would want me to find someone new and that i shouldn't let this be the end of my 'dating career' (i am 20yo). so after a lot of therapy and reaffirming my belief and faith in god, i put myself back out there. i eventually met a new girl who i loved (katie), and i saw a lot of traits in her that i saw in my ex. 

a few days ago (may 2), the parents decided to pull her off life support. at first i was extremely upset, but realized anna would want this; to end her suffering and her families). katie knew about anna and it was no surprise to her i wanted to be there when she was taken off life support. when i got there, i kissed anna's forehead, ran my hands through her hair, and told her i loved her. after the the doctors removed her tube, it was extremely emotional for all the family and me. i kissed her again (on her lips, and just whispered again ""i love you). 

at the funeral i gave her a eulogy (which katie attended) and told anna again ""i love you.""

after the funeral, katie was angry with me. she asked what i mean't when i said ""i love you, anna."" then i told her about the kiss  because i felt guilty. now, katie is now super pissed at me. she is staying with her parents and said i cheated on her. this was not my intention at all though, i just wanted anna to know (if she was even conscious) that i loved her, and would see her again. the kiss was not 'romantic' or 'sexual', it was just a final goodbye, i wanted more than to just touch her hand once last time.

i greatly appreciate the support that i received on my initial post. some of you asked me to update and i've decided that i would. 

there was a lot of concern about the possibility that i might have broken ribs from the assault. upon going to the doctor and getting x-rays, i found out that while i suffered no breaks, he did bruise my ribs. essentially i was told to rest and it should improve within 4-6 weeks. it still hurts to do just about anything involving movement. deep breaths feel like a knife in my side. i'm tempted to get a second opinion if it continues being this bad. my doctor didn't ask many questions about how i obtained my injures. i told him that i had a fall and he seemed to accept that story. 

i told my family what had happened shortly after going to the doctor. they came the following day to move me out of our flat. it was one of the most difficult things i've ever done, but i am grateful to have them to get me through everyday. my parents were just as shocked as i was to learn that my ex boyfriend was capable of something so awful. they have urged me to file a report despite my decision not to. i do not want to go through that process. it's been a terrible ordeal that i want in the past. if i'm honest perhaps there might be some loyalty to him inside me that doesn't want him in jail. we have taken photos of my injuries and saved texts (i'll get to that momentarily) should i need them in the future.

we explained the situation to my former landlord who was unexpectedly sympathetic. she let us break our lease without excess penalty other than keeping the deposit. 

my ex boyfriend had been trying to get in contact with me from the day i asked him to leave. endless phone calls and text messages that i never answered. his texts included apologies as well as promises to get help. i ended up calling him to tell him that i had moved out. to my surprise he didn't fight me. he agreed that it was for the best though he was clearly heartbroken. we have both completely moved now and i have no intention on contacting him further. 
 
i'm trying to be strong, but in my darkest moments i miss him. i miss my life. i miss waking up to and going to bed with my best friend. i miss talking to him. i miss the love we had for 3 years. i miss the person that i used to be; confident and brave. i'm fucking scared all the time now. i'm scared that i'll never be able to trust anyone in the same way i trusted him. i miss not being in pain. i'm angry at him for ruining everything and angry at myself for not seeing the signs. i alternate between being in utter denial to despair. this has been the worst experience of my life that sometimes feels like it's impossible i'll ever smile again. 

don't worry about me taking him back. telling my family cemented that that will never happen. as for the rest of it, i don't know.

so, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he's been my best friend my whole life cause i'm 22. so he's all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. 
anyways, i was cleaning my t-bone steak of all it's fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. i thought, ""man, buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!"". so i proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. i proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (quickly for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he's not one to just swallow some shit whole, so i didn't expect this, but i suppose he was feeling risky. so he's all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. i'm watching him eat it cause i'm all stoked he's enjoying himself & feeling good. 

this is where it goes south. 

the little fucker didn't think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he's running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk irishman.   i instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so i grab the fucker & tug it out. he's unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. i'm freaking the fuck out. so i start giving him cpr. (i don't know how to do cpr for humans, let alone a dog, but i gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like ""what the fuck just happened?!"". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day i die. he lays there for a second & i rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug i gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat i ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. i monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. i gave him some love & he went to sleep. 

my life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us. 

tl;dr i brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat.

"for the first time in my 20+ years of being an adult, i have $0 in credit card debt after christmas.. i know this may seem a bit crazy to have just now broken that barrier, and in the end we still spent far too much as a whole... but the fact that there is no debt is a massive, massive victory that we have never accomplished before, and we still have a (for our current situation) decent amount left in savings. 

if you'd have told me this would be my future even a year ago, i'd never have believed we would get our heads above water. 

for anyone who doesn't think they can, keep trying. never give up. don't get yourself down. we all slip, like with my past food addiction i never succeeded until i stopped beating myself up about mistakes. 

we had like $70k in debt, and are on a direct track for that to disappear. we even have cards we haven't been able to close with a decent amount of credit, but we did not touch *once* this season. 

compared to a few years ago where every single card was maxed out continuously, and where available credit was like a sign saying ""free money!"" i could not be happier. 

that's all. i just needed to say this out loud, both as a tooting of my own horn, but also to solidify it for me and remind me if i struggle. 

i don't post here like ever, but this sub has made a difference. if it weren't for reddit, i may never have gotten a good consolidation loan. so thanks. 

have an awesome new year. 

**e: oh holy night, *now* i understand ""rip my inbox"" comments, but couldn't be happier.**

thanks to everyone who replied, it means the world! for those with questions i do intend to get back to you, and for those posting words of encouragement, thank you so much for that. 

one question i've gotten a lot is how we did it. that was the part that surprised us. we have a house with minimal equity, which helped a small amount with using that equity to pay down a fraction of our debt, but it was the chunk we needed to get the okay on our consolidation loan (and banks love to have *all* of your accounts). combined that with our reasonable income (i'm on disability but my wife makes a high 5 figure salary so it gave us a good footing) and the fact that we have not missed a minimum bill payment and it provided us the leverage we desperately needed. 

i can say that one of the best things you can have under your belt is to be able to go to the bank with a positive payment history. too many late payments really mess with your credit score, so even if you can *only* just make the minimum payment, do that! 

cutting costs and trying to be more pragmatic is the other huge step that we needed to make. i worked hard to get my health in shape and doing that made my propensity for impulse and worthless spending easier to control. it may sound cliche, but i remember starting to change when winter soldier came out, i realized i had about 20k in debt id racked up on a card and had been putting off telling my wife about it every time she asked for a balance. my days were absolutely miserable. i was trying with all my power to avoid telling her, and finally admitting it was *hard as hell*, but we made it through it. 

it is possible to do it, because if someone who has as much of an addiction to buying useless shit as i do can, it's possible for anyone else. like quitting smoking or losing weight, you very well *may* stumble or even fail. that's natural. do *not* let that get you down, please don't. we are human and we are all fucked up in our own unique ways, getting out of debt is a very weird and challenging part of life, it may feel like a slog (it sure has for years) and you may get to the ground floor and fail again (this is not our first rodeo with consolidation loans) but if you persist, you may just be able to succeed. 

again, it's cliche but if you fall, pick yourself up again and get back into the fray. don't let debt win. it's not worth living your life running to try and play catch-up. that new thing you *must*  have feels that way for a very short time after you buy it, and that feeling goes away.  and when it's gone the only solution is to buy more and more, but being debt free and being able to buy that cool thing without having to go insane figuring out how you'll ever pay it off is **way fucking better.**

thank you all, again. you've fucking made my christmas and new year. ",10

"discovered i make $1.50 more an hour than new hires - after being at the job for 7 years.. we are in dire need of staff which i assume is the reason for the higher than normal starting wage. but i feel underappreciated because of this. 

imo if they can afford to pay new people as much as they are, they can afford to pay me more. 

is it wrong of me to ask for a few more dollars per hour raise with this being the only reason? it's been awhile(a year or so) since i have gotten a raise and perhaps i'm using this as an opportunity to ask for more?

i'm not sure if i am thinking about this correctly. 



thoughts? 

thanks in advance.


edit: the consensus is that it is wrong to consider asking for a raise simply due to how much new hires are making, regardless of time in the company considering my work ethic. i agree but was not seeing it that way.

if anyone has more to add beyond that i would be happy to hear it.

i appreciate the answers and honesty. thank you all.

edit two: well this got bigger than expected. i cannot express how much the priceless advice means to me. i have been humbled in more ways than one.

edit three: so i have spent several hours replying to as many people as i can, but i'm saying much the same thing to everyone so i'll just say it here. 


 i have learned quite a few things from this post. i think an honest upfront conversation with my manager is in order, with the knowledge it may lead nowhere. i have not done any research into what someone with my position and experience is worth. if it had been another, larger, company than my current one i can only assume i would of had more *opportunity* to move up. **but** considering my attitude towards my current line of work / the way i have approached it these past 5 years(coasting), i do not think i would have received those promotions. and that's okay. that just means i need to change. i need to improve.


*i need to move on.* 

this job is not something i would have pictured working for 7 years when i was fresh out of high school. i like the work but it's just not for me anymore. it's not a career by any means. a career is something i have thought about for a long time. something i really want. i am not sure what was holding me back, fear complacency laziness? probably all of the above. i regret wasting so much of my time. 



so in regard to the main point here: i do understand and agree that tenure *alone* is not sufficient for a raise, and is certainly a weak argument to make to your boss *if* in that time i have not provided more than a body for the company. which is the case for me. i also understand the need for the higher wages the new employees will be earning. seems to simply be a market value thing. we need people badly, so it only makes sense you would offer more money to draw people in. i can respect that in conjunction with my current wage considering the effort i put in and all i offer. 

i really appreciate the advice, the kind words, and you sharing your experiences with me. i needed to hear *all* of it. it has helped me in so many ways. this post will literally change my life, even outside of my job. i won't be replying to many more people, but i will be reading every comment. 

sorry for the wall of text. considering what this has all meant to me, i felt the need to express it. 

take care everyone, best of luck to you and yours. i appreciate it, so much.",10

my friend do not know what to do. she cried yesterday while being with our other friends. we are motivating her to move away from her parents and start her own life. but she is too scared to take any actions.

if the marriage continues and they both get married, her life will get ruined. she will get abused more and will be forced to work in kitchen for rest of her life.

"for not wanting my in-laws to visit our new baby?. just to preface, my husband's brother has two kids, and his parents babysit them at least 3 days a week. i feel like this has kind of set the expectation for frequency of visits with grandparents. 

i just had a baby on july 10th, and my husband's mom has been over to visit us 5 times since then. i know she means well, but it's very stressful to have a newborn and to feel like i have to entertain also. it would be different if she was offering to help with something (not that i expect that of visitors, but people visiting new parents usually at least offer). she also seems to conveniently always come while he's napping (he naps for 2+ hours at a time at this point), and she leaves once he starts getting a little fussy, which is frustrating because any rest or chores i could get in while he's asleep don't get done. 

she texted me yesterday asking to come for a visit today. this is the first week my husband is back at work full time, and i'm trying to get in the groove of a new routine. i wrote her back and told her that i'm really not up for visitors this week because i'm getting settled in, and she freaked out and texted my husband asking what she did to offend me. she hasn't talked to me since yesterday after i wrote her, and she basically implied to my husband that we're being selfish keeping her grandson away from her. here?",3

and he's not racist at all, he is an amazing guy and i'm so lucky to be with him. 

so we're gonna find our names together. if we both agree on an ""american"" name, it's fine. she really is gonna be surrounded by her arab heritage so much with our big family and everything, if a name helps him feel more connected to our baby, it's all his.

"by not reading a tinder bio. alright, so this happened ""yesterday"" so its technically  yifu. but whatever. 

so, a couple weeks ago i was swiping on el tinder when i saw a cute goth girl. lets call her lizzie. anyways, i was fairly tired at that moment and only glanced over the bio. this was the fuckup. 

lizzie and i match and get to talking. she is really nice, into the same nerdy shit i am, a fantastic shitposter, good conversationalist. and very,very cute. i'm thinking she is already my next girlfriend assuming things go well when we meet.

couple days later we go on the date. now, i've been catfished before, so i'm already expecting that she won't be as cute as she was online. nope. she shows up looking fantastic. (just like in the simulations!) we get sushi and are having a good time, so we decide to go back to my place. 

 after a drink, some anime and good conversation, we start making out. things are getting...heavy so we go into my room, she takes off my pants and starts giving me head. awesome.  she took off her bra, not flat chested either, double awesome. (big titty goth gf reeee) anyways i'm not the type to keep a girl waiting on her knees. (*tips fedora*) so i ask her to get on the bed and we make out some more and i go to take off her skirt. the next few moments were something like this:

""uhh... whatcha got there..?""

""oh my god i thought you knew""

*windows shutdown noice as my boner collapses*

""..nope. i had no clue""

soooooo, she had a dick. turns out, she did say she was trans in her bio. pre op.  been on hormones for a while and is going to make the switch. while im not transphobic or homophobic, i do have boundaries. i didn't freak out or anything. i assured her its fine, y'know shit happens. we ended up getting dressed, knocking back a few more shots and exchanging life stories until she sobered up and went home. ended up friends after all was said and done. 

always. read. bios.

tldr: didn't read a tinder bio, got my dick sucked by a pre op trans girl. took off her skirt, saw a dick.

&#x200b;

well, it's been like 12 days. the long and the short of it: the truth came out. wedding has been put on hold while ""she gets help"" and i am left to pick up the mess and deal with everyone. i need a stiff drink and a vacation.

&#x200b;

a lot of people said some things that really struck with me. the photo of the stripper seemed to be odd, and you're right, it made no sense. why would he take a picture that was so compromising? why would he risk possible criminal charges if someone felt he went too far? how was he so cavalier? i sat her down and demanded the whole truth. we talked the night that i posted and we talked from 6ish until 3 or 4. we went moment by moment, step by step, and i demanded to know what happened. so, here's what *actually* happened:

&#x200b;

they got together for pre-fun cocktails and dinner but ate very little. they drank and drank and then had a hotel room booked as their base of operation from which they'd change and go to a club then crash at the end of the night. they got to the hotel and everyone was drunk. instead of cooling their jets, they wanted to have more fun. two of the bridesmaids suggested getting topless (one is a school teacher and the other is a surgical nurse...) and then my fiancees bright idea? *get high.* but on what you might add? oh, only painkillers she illicitly procured during her mother's final months and had been taking to help deal. yeah, fucking lovely. my mil had been on dilaudid, ativan and others. they all popped a pill, finishing the bottle and then the moh's surprise - a stripper. so, who took the pills *and drank?* only my future wife. yeah, the rest of them realized that was a shit idea and instead just stuck to booze. it's why my fiancee was fall-down dumb and couldn't hold herself together. my fiancee doesn't drink, so i should have connected the dots there. that's on me i guess.

&#x200b;

the reality of the stripper is that they jumped around topless, drank and laughed while my fiancee was stoned and drunk. stripper never fingered her. she kissed him then he kissed her neck and she hugged him but he was clear what the rules were and not only did he not touch her but they are pretty sure he ended things early and left to avoid a problem. the photo was a set-up and she was wearing underwear but not much else. she then admitted she would have fucked the stripper so that i would leave her. she said that she was mad at her mother for declining treatment early on and for her father for not pushing her into treatment earlier. she was mad at the whole situation and she began to take some pills. then she was mad she was taking the pills and wanted to put distance between us. i couldn't figure out what pills she was taking until it dawned on me: near the end her mother was in pain and they gave her a prescription that made her really sick so another was issued. i thought the pills were destroyed but i guess my fiancee didn't do that - i had no reason to assume she would lie. in the years we've been together/known each other she's drank maybe 3 times and been really seriously drunk only once. i didn't think she'd do that.

so, that brings me to the texts. i ask her why, if she would have fucked that guy to hurt me, she didn't want me to know. she explained that she felt horrible guilt, didn't know what to do and realized it wasn't what she wanted and got scared that i was going to find out and leave her. her moh, who hired the stripper, wanted me to know about the drugs and thought she could scare her into telling me. her bridal party were divided all wanted the wedding to proceed but half wanted her to disclose the pills she stole and the others didn't. by this point i didn't know what to do.

i followed advice given her and said we needed to delay the wedding. she began to panic and begged me not to. she started making bizarre fucking suggestions - we could do whatever i wanted for the next year and even offered to let me hit her to get back but begged me not to walk away from us. she then said she had a problem and needed help, her dad is a nice guy but not emotionally all that available. she said that without me she'd be alone and that despite everything she loved me. that i don't actually doubt, i think she really does love me.

&#x200b;

so what happened?

&#x200b;

she saw her doctor on monday who immediately used the words ""abuser"" and ""addict"" and strongly recommended blood tests, medical tests and a referral to a psychiatrist. we got the name of the doctor and i guess they move quickly because by the following day she was meeting with the psychiatrist. he recommended different types of therapy. we had a ""group meeting"" and he's said my wife is absolutely an addict - she was using the prescription pills and alcohol and my fiance admitted she had been drinking on the sly for some time. she's taken a leave from her work and is in group therapy sessions, meeting with a psychologist and recuperating by focusing on diet, exercise and self-improvement. we're down to one salary (mine) and absolutely cannot afford extras, so the wedding is currently on hold.

&#x200b;

this meant that i had to have very uncomfortable conversations with everyone, including my family, her family and our friends. her father talked to me and told me that he feels terrible. he knows he has trouble being emotionally available and said that he wasn't really there for his daughter and felt horrible. my parents are well-to-do and helped with some bills that unexpectedly came in and have been helping a lot with everything. my fiancee has been going to my parent's house to work with my mother on gardening and to do other things around the house. the bridal party & maid of honor came to meet with me and bought me breakfast. they admitted that they suspected she had been taking the pills as she was a little looser with them and felt that the bachelorette party was a huge mistake. she drank way too much and they didn't stop her. i thanked them for their apology but said i didn't know what to say. they just offered their apologies and said that i was a great guy.

&#x200b;

the long-and-the-short of it is we're not sleeping in the same room. we aren't having sex. we are right now in this weird healing phase. her team has recommended i see individual therapy which i haven't yet had the time to do. a lot of bills have come in and we've delayed the wedding - no rest for the wicked, i guess. my parents have been absolutely wonderful in all of this.

&#x200b;

fiancee and i are in a weird place. she's overly nice and sympathetic. since she's home, she cooks a lot more, focuses on tasks around the house and has been working hard on exercising. she submits to drug tests and we have a bactrack if i'm concerned she's drinking. i'm a lot more aware of what's going on. she's attended a secular sobriety organization and meets with them. she's in group therapy and individual therapy.

&#x200b;

i kind of feel like i got shat on again and don't have a next move planned. people keep telling me to watch out for myself, but i'm not sure what to do.

&#x200b;

so that's what happened. i'm stunned and confused. turns out people can really surprise you, and not always in a good way. i still love her and depending on how things go, we'll see about getting back to a place where we can think about a wedding. for now, i'm going to eat some bacon and try to enjoy the weekend.",7
"by not hitting my girlfriend's ass. short and sweet one: today, my girlfriend and i were presented the rare treat of an empty apartment, and thus decided to get nice and loud.  as she was riding me cowgirl, i decided to give her ass a nice hard slap; however, as we were being rougher than usual, she was bouncing up and down in a manner that made it hard to hit her bum.  thus, on my attempt at spanking her, my hand instead collided against my left testicle.  instantly, a pain shot through the core of my very being, causing me to cry out in pain.  my girlfriend, being the epitome of love and sympathy that she is, immediately collapsed on the bed cackling like a mad witch while i cradled my bruised babymakers.

"i 23f caught my younger siblings having sex while my mom was away on a short vacation with my aunt. i don't know if i should and how i should tell her. i'm 23f and i live with my mom still, i also have 2 other siblings 19f and 17m who live with my mom too. my dad isn't around  (he passed away 10 years ago) and it has just been my mom and us 3. i am working already, while my sister is in college and working part time, then my little brother is in his last year of high school.

my mom has a good job, earns a lot of money, and we works really hard. it's been years since she has really had a break and her boss told her to take a week off since she had paid for a week long trip to a resort that isn't very far. she went with my aunt whom she's super close with and another friend  who we have known for years.

obviously we are all old enough to take car of ourselves for a few days and we are all responsible. so my mom left. i would come home from work as normal, and go out with friends or just stay at home. one if the nights, i came back home pretty late, around 12 at night which usually i would already be home asleep by 9 or 10.

i heard them and saw them in my brother's room having sex. i am completely sure that it was both of them. i was about to freak out on them but then again it'a the two of them against me and i don't know if my mom would believe them and think i'm crazy or believe me so i just took it calm and tried to go to sleep. 

it's been a few days since my mom got back, i haven't said anything, and i feel kind of icky when i talk with or see my siblings. i want to tell my mom but i don't know how to do it without her freaking out on me or her thinking i'm lying? should i just ignore the whole situation instead?


so, i'm going to answer frequent questions i get since i can't reply to 2k+ comments.

first off- stop pming me making white racial jokes, we are not white, we are latino/a.

second off- i'm not giving away any personal information.

third-i make spellung and grammar errors because my family's native language is spanish not english and i am also using reddit on my phone

fourth, i haven't told my mom or any of my siblings yet i'm super nervous about this.

"question on the movie interstellar (which i am told is fairly scientifically accurate), if time on the water planet moves so slowly, what would someone on the shuttle observe with a really good telescope?. so if i recall, massive gravitational forces slow time, and in the movie, they depicted 1 astronaut remaining on a ship out of range, but within view (perhaps with a super large telescope)

so theoretically, if this is remotely scientificly accurate, what would the person on the space shuttle see when they looked down at the planet?  would they see a person moving at super slow speeds?",9

"by going commando. **for the record: the girl i'm seeing encouraged me to create an actual account to share this fuck up. i have read some crazy ass stories on here so, uh, it's hard to tell if this post will even come close to the standard of this sub.** 

*shrug*

**s'up.**

this happened last weekend. 

i went to my friend's house party wearing nothing but my panda onesie. i thought underwear would be overkill since it gets so damn hot in that thing. so, i eliminated the unnecessary layers and went commando. oof. it was freeing. the penis was a swingin' and the balls was a breathin'. pure cock flopping fun i tell thee. and so... off i go... with a hop and skip... and a bouncing dick. 

cut to me and this cute girl grinding on the dance floor. her ass was rubbing against me so fucking hard, it triggered **the boner.** aw, fuuuck! it's gonna stick out like a sore thumb underneath this damn onesie. i literally spin her ass around so it doesn't touch my dick no more. worst. fucking. mistake. this girl, in the heat of the moment, rips open my onesie, exposing my bare boner for all to see. as if that wasn't bad enough, my dick *fucking flexes* right before i cover up. folks there lost their shit. dick jokes, drunken laughter, cat-calls & whistles, all erupted in that moment. i questioned so many life choices as i stood there, frozen and flustered as fuck. 

for the rest of that night i had to dodge a mob of wasted degenerates on a mission to rip me open. the motherfuckers called it the panda challenge.

"by broadcasting porn to my son's room.. this happened to me 30 minutes ago and i didn't know what to do some i am going to chronicle it here.

it all started with my son asking if i could use airplay to stream some league of legends games to his t.v. since worlds are going on. i was reluctant at first since it was almost his bedtime, however i figured what the hell i do things like that all the time so i should go ahead and let him watch until 12ish. he tells me what games he wants to watch and i set up the connection and explain to him that i would let him stay up until 12, however he isn't to tell his mom because she would kill me since his bed time is 10.

my wife works from home and does most of her work at night while everyone is in bed because me and my son are ""loud and obnoxious"". at the time of the incident she is in her office, which is across the hall from my son's room, with the door locked while she is working. i was watching some carnival row and i said to myself ""self, now is an opportune time to stroodle the ole noodle. i pull out my phone and go to my incognito mode, ;) gotta be safe, and precede to search me out a suitable video. after a few minutes of searching i found some material and decided to go ahead and start it while i gathered the appropriate tools for the job. i press play and lay my phone on the bed and go grab some lotion and tissues. i jump back into bed placed my items beside of me and reached for my phone. that is when i realized it. i am panicking, fuck fuck fuck, across my screen it has airplay and my son's t.v. was selected. 2 minutes has passed in the video and i thought ok maybe nothing has showed yet so i change it back to league and started to gather myself to go talk to him.

that is when i hear it. my wife is screaming to the top of her lungs and i hear my son pleading with her and i here him say something about dad (you little tattle tale). she is on a war-path now. uh oh. i start panicking ""oh shit oh shit oh shit"" it is like getting caught watching porn by your own mom. then things go silent and i know she is coming for me i hastily throw the tissues and lotion under the bed and roll over and try to pretend i went to sleep. she kicks the door open, and i pressing my head through my pillow at this moment. she screams my name. my mind went blank and i made a snoring sound. that was probably the real fuck up. i heard her say, ""oh this bitch going to pretend to be asleep, ok ok."" i decided i needed to answer her or i am a dead man. i rolled over and said ....yea? at this point i am waiting for her to make like a cartoon and turn into a steam whistle. she precedes to chew me a new one. to paraphrase something like ""here i am working then i hear people fucking across the hall and come to find out your streaming porn to his room, blah blah irresponsible, blah blah dumbass, blah blah sleeping on the couch"". she storms off and i heard her office door slam. i gather a blanket and my pillow and go to the couch, my son's door is shut and i don't want to press my luck as i walk by. i head to the couch and thought you know this needs to go to and here i am. hopefully she doesn't smother me in my sleep lol.

thanks for the silver and gold kind strangers, you honor me. wow and platinum, thanks a lot. :d

edit/update 1: wow, woke up and this post really blew up. wife woke me up this mourning so we could talk about what happened lol. she wasn't upset by the porn, she was upset because she thought our son had porn blasting on his t.v. at 12 at night while he was suppose to be asleep and interrupting her work. which escalated when she found out that i told him he could stay up until 12 and i, in fact, was the one who did the porn streaming. which escalated when she opened the door and i was pretending to be asleep. one thing i wanted to address is that she is by no means a bitch, she is an amazing and wonderful woman that just lost her cool. we have all been there at some point. we don't have an abusive relationship. she is the authoritarian in the house and i am a bit of a goofball, however we are fine with that as we rarely have a disagreement and compliment each other very well.

update 2: talked to my son while taking him to school and he finds the situation hilarious and can't wait to tell his friends. when i told him i can't believe he threw me under the bus he told me i would do the same and he is right.

update 3: sorry i have no intention of linking the ""sauce"" some mysteries are better left unsolved.

tl:dr i was using airplay to stream videos to my sons room while he was suppose to be sleeping, decided to spank it and accidentally streamed porn to my son's room while my wife was right across the hall from him.",4
"landlord forgot to pay our water bill so our water was shut off. is it fair to ask for a month's free water?. i hope this is the right sub!  i moved into a new rental house on february 7th.  the landlord said that he keeps the water bill in his name and provides up bills to pay him, he then pays the water company.  we gave him a $300 water deposit ahead of moving in (in addition to our security deposit).  yesterday, february 26, we come home from work to find a note from the utility and our water shut off.  we call the landlord immediately and he is super apologetic and gets us buckets of tap water to use to flush the toilet.  my husband, myself, and my infant daughter got ready and off to work/daycare with no running water.  landlord called the utility and they said it will be back on within 24 hours meaning i don't know if there will be running water when i get home or not. my landlord has not offered or brought up a discount at all!  only apologizing over and over again.  is it fair for me to push for a month's free water?  i know it was only one day but i had dirty dished, i couldn't cook dinner, couldn't shower or bathe my child for work.  even washing my hands was a pain in the ass.  


tl;dr: water got shut off for a day (maybe 2 days) because landlord didn't pay bill.  what kind of discount/reimbursement should i request?


edit/update:  thank you everyone for the feedback!  my take away is that, yes, a month's free water is way too much to ask (darn!).  my intention is to ask for the days without water removed from the rent bill.  i pay $2300 in rent so accounting for 28 days in the month, that would $82 for each day (or i could calculate 30 days).  i want to add- i am on great terms with my landlord and will always strive to be a good tenant.  even though i am upset (because i had a sink full of dishes and a washer full of baby clothes, and i can now smell myself at my desk due to no shower, i'm a pumping mom so my pump stuff smelled like sour milk this morning and i had to wash it in the office sink), i wouldn't express this to him that way - always professional & kind.  we plan to live in this home for 3-5 years so i don't want to negatively impact that in any way.

2nd edit:  i should add that $82 or $164 (will find out when i get home tonight) will be at least equal to or greater than one month water bill, ha!",10
"30 year old with $1,000. hey reddit, take it easy on me i've suffered from p.t.s.d. and depression/anxiety for about 8 years

i have no college education, but i did go back and recieve my h.i.s.e.t/g.e.d. 

i have been working on and off construction gigs in montana for the last few years. its not a great fit, my employers love me because i work really hard, but i never make more than $20 an hour. the work is hard on me, i'm a skinny guy who is not very healthy, everything hurts at the end of the day. 

i want to start making money but i am overwhelmed. i've never been good with finance and feel like i am running out of time.

i think about college but i always hear horror stories of debt and useless degree's.

i am pretty good with computers. i spend most of my free time gaming. it is sort of a passion. i just don't see how someone like me could make something in the gaming industry work.

any suggestions on how to get back on track and stop working myself to death for a paycheck to paycheck depressionfest?

edit2: i only expected a few people to see this, i'm sorry i can't reply to you all. but i really appreciate you guys taking the time out of your day to give me advice. 

update: some of you have sent me some seriously amazing responses, great advice and even job offers.

some of you are asking about my p.t.s.d. i was not in the military. it was caused from something else. i keep erasing and re-writing these next lines because i feel like i should have to defend the reason i have p.t.s.d. the fact is. it sucks. you re-live something over and over playing it out in your head. i understood it at the time, i knew what it was. but i thought i could just splash water on my face get over it.. i fought it for years. maybe if i was brave enough to ask for help, instead of trying to deny that there was something wrong with me, these last few years could have been different. all i'm saying is that i came here for advice and got a ton of it. so the one thing i might be able to give back is that if you think something is wrong, you should seek help not shelter.

update 2: ""learn to code!"" i hear you guys, i am on it. python installed pycharm installed and i taking udemy courses. 

this thread will serve as a tool over the next week/s something i can really search through and hopefully find a path that i can follow.

"if i cancelled the adoption of my stepdaughter?. using throwaway 


so as the title suggests, i'm currently in the process of adopting my stepdaughter.



me and her mom have been married a year and the daughter was the product of a horribly abusive ex-husband. this abuser was still in their lives when we were dating and i used lawyers and the courts to slowly push him out where he has no control over their lives and he is starting to give up fighting the adoption because i'm set to win in a few months.



now because of personal issues of our own, my wife has just told me that she wants to file for divorce, but that she wants to wait until after i adopt our kid.



when i told her that i was afraid of adopting our daughter because of the child support i'll have to pay and not being a family anymore (which is why i wanted to in the first place) she had a full panic attack and accused me of leaving her in her abuser's control.



for info, the daughter is 5 and calls me dad.



so reddit, if i told my lawyer to stop the adoption process if i knew my wife was going to leave me after?


edit: wow this really blew up. to give answers to some repeated questions/comments:

yes i know the ex-husband is abusive for a fact, no this is not about the money her panic attack was about the control her ex has, and i will not even entertain the idea of suing for full custody myself.


edit 2: went out for a few drinks because i needed them because of all of this. 


wife had just been diagnosed with some mental struggles and her therapist urged her to allow the meds to take effect before she made a major life decision.


i was originally leaning towards adoption because i love that little girl and we get along almost better than her and her mom but after reading the almost 2400 comments at this point and roughly 200-300 pms i've decided to talk to a lawyer when i get home to make an informed decision.",3

"i stole $45,000 from my former employer and think i am morally justified. i read the other posts about people taking money out of the tills and thought i could do better than that. so no one knows this but i used to work for a bank (i assume no one is going to have sympathy for these guys) for several years. i won't say where or which one. towards the end i was essentially redundant but they refused to pay me out and instead insisted on keeping me and proceeded to try to bully me into quitting. i have mental health problems and this began a mental breakdown for myself. i used all my sick leave and they refused further leave, i got the union involved but they are piss weak. eventually got some leave entitlements plus a little extra with an agreement not to sue, \~$30,000. this was about $45,000 less than what my redundancy should've been at the time. being mentally fragile i accepted as i didn't have the capacity or support to fight for my rights (i would have had a very strong legal case).

so as you do when you're a bit down you have some erratic and destructive thinking. in the bank i worked in credit, fraud and collections among other things so i knew all the holes in the systems... a few phoney applications later i managed to get i estimate maybe $45,000 not including costs out of them. i won't say how because it was very specific to the organisation but had to get the money in actual products not cash so i then formed a business to turn the products into cash.

i made a few mistakes along the way but i know financial crime is never investigated and i made sure that there was nothing linking the applications together so they wouldn't even know it was one person.

another plus was it made me very very happy doing this. win win. i don't feel guilty in the slightest. i think i actually went pretty easy on them.

tl:dr scammed my ex employer out of my rightful entitlements.",11

last night however he woke me up around 1am to have a little midnight fun (he must've been having a good dream). i was about it, we started in, and let the good times roll. it was all going per usual, he was done, i was making my steady climb up the hill to heaven. my eyes were closed and i was not being very quiet. right as i was about to start my journey back down to earth i feel a long wet tongue on my face. open my eyes, my gsd is standing in my face looking worried and trying to kiss me. 

let me tell you, there is no quicker turn off and end to a climax then getting kissed in the mouth by your slobbery dog. i pushed my dog away and my fiance just burst into tears from laughing so hard. 

tl;dr we started having sex in the middle of the night, forgot about the dogs. my gsd snuck up and mouth kissed me at my climax and ruined my night.

"my daughter (8f) came home from school yesterday with individually bagged anti depressants her mother sent her with that i was entirely unaware of. what are my options?. my ex and i have maintained a, often at times,  highly contentious co-parenting relationship. we've been separated for over 7 years and i strongly disagree with many of her parenting methods. we have joint legal custody of our daughter and she has primary physical custody as my overnights equate to 30% of all overnights annually. on to last night...

as i'm finishing up dinner preparations, my daughter comes downstairs with three individual baggies and informs me she needs to take her medicine before dinner. after asking what medicine it is, she informs me it is to help with her stress. i immediately take the bags and tell her she will not be taking anything that i do not know about. i step outside to call her mother as i am fuming at this point because this is far from the first time i have been uninformed (whether it be school absences, doctor visits, etc.). her mother proceeds to tell me she has started her on sertraline hydrochloride as a result of her stress levels and panic attacks of late. she says my daughter's therapist and primary physician decided this course of action based on her mother telling them of these alleged occurrences. 

now her mother is truly someone i believe to exhibit the characteristics of munchausen syndrome by proxy. she has three other children (5, 3, and newborn) with each of them regularly diagnosed with new issues (yes, even the newborn). for some reason i have not witnessed a single occurrence of a panic attack in my daughter and her stress levels, although elevated at times (i mean, whose aren't?) are far from abnormal. 

i am at a complete and utter loss at the moment. for one, why would the first solution to be to put her on anti anxiety/depressant medication? for example, i know her bed times are consistently late (often approaching 11 pm), maybe her ""panic attacks"" are crankiness as a result of often being tired. two, who in the world thinks it appropriate to send an eight year old child to school with unmarked bags with pills and rely on her to take proper doses at proper times, all without informing the other parent. three, there is a newborn baby in their household and i can't help but feel her mother is overwhelmed and using this medication as a form of parenting.

"for refusing to pay for my step-daughter's expenses after she got pregnant?. my husband was a teen dad, we will refer to his daughter as an. an's mom, grandma and ggrandma were all teen moms. an is now 16 years old, and pregnant.

an stays mostly with us because i am the one who pays (most of– 75%) her private high school tuition. it had always been my husband who pays for an's expenses.

when an turned 14 she wanted to move in with us to start her high school(hs) in the big city we live in. we checked on hs and since public school is terrible here, we decided to enroll her in a fancy private hs. she has always been set that she wanted to be an economist, and that she wanted to move to another country to pursue her dream. i have been separating some money for this purpose, too.

my husband and i came to an agreement that i would also help her dream to come true, but i would cease any economic help towards her tuition if she became a teen mom (an did not know this) and he agreed. this conversation took place two years ago... and now, an is pregnant as soon as she finished her first year.

i laid some facts down to an, gave her some articles and statistics about how teen moms are one of the most vulnerable groups of people, that this will hinder her dream of going to another country to study and that she knows the stigma it comes with. i recommended she terminated the pregnancy.

an's mom is ecstatic and so is her grandma. they have this weird belief where they think they can make it for so much better for her than it was for them because of ""all the experience"". i think they're absolute loonies; i bet they don't even have the money to pay for the hospital when the time comes. i believe they think we will pay for all of the unborn child's costs.

i am dead serious about stopping tuition and using the money i've been saving in other stuff if an decides to carry on with the pregnancy. i have not and will not make the ultimatum of ""terminate or i'll stop paying your tuition"", but i will tell her that i won't pay for her nice school and her child's expenses if she decides she wants to keep it. i don't even want to become one of those grandmas who take care of the child. i firmly believe a normal teen life has to be child-free. money will go to some of the child's expenses and i will give no more. an can either enroll in a public high school (or one within her dad's budget) and set herself for a uni scholarship under dad's budget.

my husband is telling me i need to understand the situation. i do not and will not endorse this teen mom dynasty in any way, this is the hill i will die on. i can actually continue paying for her fancy high school, saving (a lot less) for the uni, and  some of the future child's expenses too, but i feel like i'll be rewarding her for being irresponsible and fucking myself over something i shouldn't. husband firmly believes i am doing this to punish an and i am being an ass for compromising her future over this matter. aita?

&#x200b;

**edit/commonly asked questions:** ann will not stop attending high school- she will just stop attending the fancy private school. i will use that same money to finance some of the child's caring, but i also feel this is not my baggage and has to be something bio mom and dad have to solve themselves (i still need to make a budget, but i don't think i will pay the full $1000 equivalent of tuition a month on child support, bio mom has to pay at least something once in her life).

no, i will not make an ultimatum. i haven't spoken to ann about this situation. i plan on telling her i can't support fancy high school + child support, but not both. she still will be able to attend a less prestigious school, not a bad one but not the best, that her father would finance. if father and bio mom want fancy high school, they should pay them themselves.

i will definitely not pay for the private university. the country's private universities tend to give scholarships, she could apply for one. i am not closing her educational options. i may not be giving her the best (the money for her to go to lse, for example) but i am not giving her the worst.

finally, the father of the upcoming child is a young man she met in some of her extra activities outside of school. parents said they would pay for child support, but unless this teen gets a part time job (part time jobs here to high school students pay around 200 a month), the parents will only be able to give $300 a month. that would cover a month of 5hour/5days a week daycare.

**another edit because forgot to add:** ann was supposed to be on the pill. gyn recommended the pill instead of an implant because of some reproductive issues bio mom has. she stopped taking the pill because mom told her she would get fat and then proceeded to *educate her* on the ""natural"" way, as in having sex before, during, and some days after her period. husband and i have been teaching her sex-ed since she got her first period when she was 11, but i'm fearing of bio mom's teachings, and at this point i just want to fist fight bio mom.",3
"for putting my foot down and not allowing my mother in law to come to christmas.. my mother in law is a horrible person who loves to create drama whenever she can. 

last christmas we got both of our kids different gifts as one was a 13 year old girl and one is a 10 year old boy. 
my mil (mother in law) decided to tell my daughter that she didn't get as many gifts as my brother and that we spent less on her. 
basically trying to get our daughter to believe that we loved her less. 
we then had to deal with a crying 13 year old on christmas. 

she has also brought super expensive gifts for people specifically to upstage everyone, she will even make a point of mentioning how much it is in front of people. 

she called up to ask what we will be doing for christmas as it's our turn, i mentioned that me and my wife want to have a potluck at our place. 
she then proceeded to explain to me how we shouldn't let some family members cook certain food because of some instances where they fucked up and ruined the dish (this is all completely false information that she is mentioning to try and start some more family drama)

i then decided to put my foot down and told my wife that i do not want her at our house starting drama on christmas and that her phone call was the last straw. 

wife is completely against it and thinks i'm being incredibly cruel to her mum, and doesn't want to exclude her.

edi.

i have tried to talk to her and she doesn't care.",3
"by sending a picture of my my sloppy poo to my evil boss and getting fired. nsfw. this happened on the day before christmas eve (the 23rd). i worked at a supermarket and as you can guess, just before christmas the store is absolutely hectic.

so on the night before christmas eve eve (22nd) i started having some pretty sloppy poos. throughout the night this case developed into a hole shitshow of sloppy shits. i was going back and forwards to the toilet all night and only managed to get a couple hours sleep. if i'm completely honest i'm surprised i didn't soil myself and i'm actually a little bit proud of the fact that i didn't. 

when morning came my sloppy poos were still at their height and showing no resistance, i really could not muster up the courage to go into work whilst the shits were at their peak. i knew that i would not last an hour working the cash register. if i were to try it would only result in two scenarios; me either sprinting to the toilet and looking a fool or the much more likely scenario of me shitting myself in public (one of my worst fears). i picked up my phone and called in sick.

just with my luck, my ass of a boss answered the phone. she's quite the bitch and to no surprise she was not too happy when i told her i would not be coming in. i am a good employee and from the few years of working at the store i've only had 1 or 2 days off (i very rarely get i'll), i assumed it wouldn't be too hard to get a day off. damn i was wrong. 

she started accusing me of faking an illness  and bitching out due me not wanting to come into a work due to it being one of the busiest days of the year.  she called me lazy and told me how i'm not a ""team player"". she called me many many names (which was completely unneeded) and expressed about 50,000 times how she did not believe that i was ill and how she just knew i was lying to get the day off. she told me how she was expecting to see me in work later. the whole time i was trying to keep my cool and trying to explain to her how i in-fact did have the shits and how it would definitely not be a good idea to come into work. she still refused to believe. 

little did she know i had just brewed up a pretty horrific poop. still on the phone i told her calmly and gently that if she did not believe me i would simply prove it to her. 

i hung the phone up and snapped a quick picture of the ass goblin i had produced. with no hesitation i proceeded to send the picture to my boss on facebook messenger then i and happily flushed the beast away. 

no more than a few minutes later i received a phone call from the boss where she in short told me how i was being fired. i guess she didn't really like the pic i sent her

if i'm honest i don't really care that she fired me. i was contemplating leaving anyway. she is definitely on my top five list of the biggest dicks i've met. but either way i really didn't want to get fired. 

tl;dr
i developed a pretty shitty case of diarrhoea on christmas eve eve. i could not possibly have gone into work (in a supermarket). i called the super mega bitch of a boss to let her know i won't be in. she refused to believe and accused me of lying. i sent her a picture of my shit and she fired me a few minutes later.

"if women can't be topless in public, then fat men with manboobs need to cover up too.. it's kind of hypocritical that female breasts are ""scandalous"" when exposed in public, but when men with big floppy boobs go shirtless in public, no one bats an eye. at the end of the day, they're all fatty, fleshy chest sacks with nipples; the only difference really is the gender of who they belong to. i'd imagine that the vast majority of people would rather see female boobs than flabby manboobs. if women have to cover up, then so do well-endowed men.",6
"by going jogging - i'm bloody and afraid to go this route again.. unlike most posts, this happened just half an hour ago. 

i'm a 21 year-old male. i was out running my 2 miles. headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. i round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and i see this big black duck looking at me. as i get closer, i think to myself, ""man, that's a brave duck, why isn't he running away?"" i keep running and realize the duck not only isn't afraid of me or running away, he's running right at me. so i stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. this bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.

i'm thinking to myself, ""what the fuck?"" so i'm like, maybe he's just an asshole and i keep running think he will leave me alone. i start running again and the faster i run, the faster he chases me. i start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. i'm thinking, ""i've got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, i don't need this shit"" so i stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. in all my years of being a person, i've never trained for this.

this little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it's actually really hurting. he starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as i'm trying to run backwards away from him. we've covered a quarter mile at this point. i try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. i'm thinking, ""how the fuck am i gonna explain this if i have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? i'm a grown ass man. this is bullshit.""

i try running again and he keeps flying after me. i'm at a loss. i don't know what to do at this point. i'm manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. am i really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? like, i don't want to, but i might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? seriously?"" we have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. he bites me again and i drop my phone. i pick it up quickly. who do i call? i've got fucking scars and cuts all over me. while i'm debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, i hear a noise; someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.

this was a big mistake. the duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. i saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. i feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. the last i saw of him was the look i took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake i did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.

i cannot make this shit up. i would have recorded it, and i tried, but it's really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you're being eaten by a fucking duck.

this is bullshit. i'm covered in cuts and bites. most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something i was not ready for.

tl;dr i'm a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. i'm covered in blood.

https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bb6tv5/my_36m_wife_33f_was_sued_im_feeling_resentment/

**note - please don't make a comment that is hateful and derogatory towards my wife. my post last time was locked because of this and i wasn't able to respond. i'm posting this at work, and i only have a few pockets of time throughout the day where i can respond.**

by the time i was able to respond to my first post, it became locked. i read everyone's replies and thank you to those who responded with good advice. i got a lot of dm's and i wasn't able to respond to everyone, but i did read your messages. however, i did not appreciate the many comments that simply insulted my wife, i know she fucked up and i'm still very angry at her, but i want to believe she can heal and become a better a person. 

also, some of the dm's i got were extremely weird & hateful towards women in general, like stuff you see on the incel tears sub - y'all need more help than me and my wife. 

there were some common questions i wanted to address to provide additional clarification. 

* how did she avoid jail? 

i only mentioned the civil case since i felt it was the most appropriate to write about because i was originally angry about our financial situation. there was also a criminal case. our lawyer thought she would originally have to go to jail for 3 months. however, we were able to get her punishment to be community service instead. she has a lot of community service hours to fill within a year, she will also be getting visits from a po. laura and her husband did file restraining orders against her, i honestly can't blame them for that. it helped my wife that she had a clean record and has family that works in law enforcement. i want her to finish those community service hours first before we talk about her working more hours to help pay me back. 

* why did she do this to laura?

that is a good question. i asked her this multiple times over the past several months to try to understand what this woman did to my wife. she would tell me that laura deserved everything horrible thing that my wife did to her, that laura was a shitty person, a narcissist, a liar, and just overall a scumbag. but she never really gave specific examples. i've been pressing her for more info, and when she told me some specifics it made me feel sick to my stomach, not because of what laura did but because how far my wife decided to go due to some petty things that happened in their friendship. their friendship ended about 8-9 (they had been friends since early in high school) years ago and it was over a man they had both briefly dated. my wife dated ""matt"" for a few months, she broke up with him because she thought that matt had feelings for laura. laura said she didn't want to date matt because he had dated my wife. my wife decided to ""test"" her friend laura's loyalty, and told laura she had her blessing to date matt. laura and matt ended up dating for a few months, my wife stuck around while they were dating and once they broke up my wife told laura that she had failed a loyalty test. they fought, and ultimately it was laura who decided to end the friendship. (note: in case it's not clear, laura's current husband is not matt.) 

secondly, i was able to get some information from her about what inspired her to do this since their friendship had ended so long ago. my wife said she happened to see (by chance, not by stalking) laura at a restaurant about ~1.5-2 years ago, and it looked like laura had lost a lot of weight and was fit. my wife and i are both fairly overweight, and apparently laura use to be overweight too. my wife admitted that she felt angry that laura had lost a lot of weight while she had never been able to. my wife was also insulting laura and said that she doesn't make a pretty thin person and that her new muscular body was too masculine. she also insulted laura's husband's looks and physique as well. i saw both laura and her husband in person on multiple occasions - they both look like normal, attractive people who obviously work out. (i could also tell my wife was irritated when she saw laura at the courthouse the first time, and you could barely tell that laura had even had baby.) my wife admitted that she just wanted to do some snooping to try to find that laura wasn't doing well in life, she found the opposite and was jealous of laura's success. she first found out both of their job titles (they both work at tech companies with some sort of engineering title) and their estimated salaries by using something called glassdoor, and if that's accurate, then both laura and her husband make really good money. she also saw a photo on facebook of laura and her husband standing in front of what appeared to be their very beautiful and large home. she said she was angry because she knew that laura wasn't deserving of any of this. she proceeded to insult laura about how she's not that smart, not pretty, not responsible, she claimed that all laura did through college was do drugs, drink, have sex with anything that had a penis, skip class and failed a lot, my wife said that she's the type who would cheat on her husband, that she's manipulative and is always up to something, etc. 

both laura and her husband seemed very sad and exhausted throughout the whole ordeal. i never picked up on anything sinister from laura at all, i felt absolutely awful for her. i felt extreme shame and embarrassment whenever i was in the same room with laura and her husband. i don't think i was ever able to make direct eye contact with either of them.  

so..yeah. i was expecting laura to have done something truly evil or sinister in the past and that just wasn't the case. 

* does she feel remorseful?

i want to say yes, she does. she has been really depressed since this all finalized. however, i can't help but think she's sad only because she got caught. she hasn't directly said anything that would lead me to believe she is truly remorseful. 

she's still angry at laura for escalating to the point of a criminal and civil case, she feels that laura overreacted. my wife believes every horrible thing she said about laura. she's convinced that laura is some kind of alcoholic/drug addict who cheats on her husband, and is the type to lie and cheat her way to the top of her career. and somehow laura is able to hide this from everyone in her life. my wife felt like she was trying to ""expose"" laura for the monster that she is. she feels that laura pressing charges and suing her is additional proof that laura is vindictive. 

my hope is that she has time to think while she is doing her community service hours over the next year. i think she feels bad that i had to empty out our accounts and sell some things to come up with the money. i talked to her about working more hours once she has finished community service, and she agreed. 

* are you going to get divorced?

the thought has crossed my mind, but we've been together for so long and i still love her despite this disgusting thing she has done. i can't see my life without her. but, i know (and i'm having a hard time admitting this to myself) that if she doesn't improve or learn a lesson from this mess then i can't be with her anymore. a lot of people mentioned that if she can do this type of thing to an ex-friend, then she can do the same to an ex-husband. this has me worried some, i'd like to believe she wouldn't go nuclear on me if we did file for divorce. i'll be taking precautions in case i have to defend myself in the future. 


* why is she only working part-time? 

she is a licensed masseuse and works at a really nice salon/spa. her hourly wage is pretty high, but she hasn't been able to get the hours she wants at the spa she works at. she could probably get a more full time position at a different spa but with a slightly lower hourly wage, which would still bring in more income than what she is doing now. she really likes the place she is at and doesn't want to leave, but i may pressure her to full time work elsewhere to help pay me back and refill our emergency fund once she is done with community service. at the moment she is onboard with helping me put money back into our savings accounts. 

* what about therapy? 

i know we need this, both as a couple and as individuals to deal with this mess. i talked to her about this and she doesn't seem totally sold on the idea of therapy. i've expressed that i think it would help both us, and she seems indifferent at this point. i've talked to her parents, who are really angry/disappointed in her, they basically begged me not to leave her over this. i told her parents that i think therapy would help both of us, but i can't afford it now. they offered to pay for couples therapy, but that is as much as they would be able to afford, so it's a start. i know my wife will need individual therapy, and if that means i stop going to couples therapy so she can get the 1 on 1 help she needs, so be it. 


i'm not ready to call my wife a psychopath as many of the commenters did the last post. i think she got carried away, and thought she was trying to expose someone she truly believed was a bad person. i'm heavily leaning towards that she has had some sort of mental breakdown and focused all of her energy on this one woman and her life. i'm not going to give up on my wife yet. it's very possible that she has some underlying mental illness that could very well be treated with therapy or meds. 

* how much money was she sued for?

i don't want to give specific numbers, but it will take about 4-5 years to get back to where we were prior to this happening. if my wife takes on a full time after she is done with community service and hands over the majority of her paycheck, it may take less than 4 years.  

* are kids involved?

no, we don't have kids and are not planning on having any. 


* what next? 

that's what i need help with. i've sat down with my wife a few times since the post and i can feel some resistance coming from her about starting couple therapy. i think she's irritated at her parents for offering to pay for therapy for us. she has stated that she would rather us solve our problems together without interference from someone she doesn't know. she's afraid she isn't going to like any therapist we find, and that the therapist will attack her throughout our sessions. i've tried explaining to her that the therapist isn't there to blame anyone, that they would try to help us and that it would be a safe space for her to talk and vent about whatever she needs. i've brought up the idea of therapy every night since the post, and each time she has had an excuse along the lines of - it won't help, the therapist will gang up on her, she isn't going to like the therapist/the therapist won't like her, or that we can solve our own problems at home. 

tl;dr : i answered a bunch of questions i wasn't able to get to before my first post was locked. but, i really need help pushing my wife to get therapy, she is resistant and isn't convinced it will help us.",7
"i recently met a new mom friend who mentioned that she and her husband are being mentored by a couple who were able to retire in their 30s.. this new friend mentioned that she would like to ""pay it forward"" by inviting my husband and i into this ""great opportunity"".
my question is, has anyone heard about this? 

she has been extremely vague about the whole situation. she did briefly mentioned that what they do is similar to an mlm but they aren't a mlm. red flag. i know. she also was very adamant that she and her husband would have to meet with us several times to get to know us and to make sure we would be a good time investment for them and the ""power couple."" she kept saying that they are slowing achieving that lifestyle of having a  cashflow and not having to worry about money and how they are able to spend more time with their kids and travel and most importantly sharing this great opportunity.  

i really with i could tell you guys more but that's all i know. my husband is skeptical from the get go and i don't blame him. he is currently out only source of income while i'm a stay at home mom and currently 4 months pregnant.  my main concern is finding what this woman is trying to get us into and if its something bad money wise i would like to know more about it in case i run into someone like her again.

update:

i texted her this morning telling her that my husband and i were not interested and that our retirement plans are fine and doing well on their own and we do not need anymore investments or want anything she was offering. i asked her not to message me anymore. she hasn't even replied about her book lol so into the donation bin it goes. i did read it and the book alone is a good read but i don't have any use for it. 

i just want to say thank you for all the advice and for helping me uncover her scam. i hate being preyed upon but i will never jeopardize my family's financial well being especially not while were under one income. 

i'm still reading all of the comments coming in and looking up all the financial advice you guys are mentioning. once again, thank you for helping me out.",10

"i told my school my mom died in afghanistan. she then did a surprise visit on leave to the school.. back story to this, my parents split up weeks before she was deployed back in 2004. i at the time blamed her based on her actions following the family break up. she even remarried before she left the states. i refused to talk to her, i was 11 at the time. i was so angry i eventually started telling people in my school my mom died. it was mainly in response to people asking me of my personal life and what my mother does. it was a very social part of growing up, when people start inquiring about you. anyways, fast forward to her coming home for 2 weeks, she showed up to my school. keep in mind i was attending therapy during this time provided by the school and the counselor is who arranged the visit. she did a small speech to my class answering vague questions about the military and her involvement. it was my schools way of dealing with 9/11. boosting the approval of military personnel, making it more of the norm. mid speech a fellow student raises her hand and straight up says ""your son told me you died"". the room was so silent. i never felt so small. she hesitated and followed with a nervous laugh saying ""obviously that's not true"" transitioning into more answers not involving my terrible decision. to this day we never spoke about it.",11

"by snacking my wife's sister on the ass during a coed softball game thinking she was my wife.. most tifus don't get posted the same day they happened, this one is no different.
flash back 3 and a half years ago to our fall league of softball. my wife's family always has a softball team every year in their church league and our team consists of my wife, her 3 other sisters, their husband's, my father in law, myself and normally one random girl that normally changes from year to year.

just a little back story, my wife is 135 lbs but also has a generously large behind for her size and i being a male, enjoy smacking it for obvious reasons. (told you it was a little back story) 

cut to me making the 3rd out by catching a fly ball in left center and jogging into the dugout behind everyone. upon reaching the dug out, i see my wife in front of me walking in. i decided to take my baseball glove, reach back, and slap her on the ass.  immediately something felt off. i've smacked my wife's ass a lot, she enjoys it and she knows i enjoy it. the reciprocating ripple that normally can be felt when slapping her behind normally was not felt. my wife's sister turns around (who is much much much more conservative when it comes to intimacy or even being premiscoous) and my jaw drops. 
""i.. uh... thought you were.. zelda"" i babbled 
i start panicking because i just spanked my sister in law's ass in front of the entire game and didn't want to be murdered by my wife. i turn some shade of red and started contemplating how to injure myself so i could get away from my soon to be death. 
luckily my wife and all of her sisters are practically clones of each other, blonde hair blue eyes, and extremely beautiful (my wife being the best out of them all) they have been mistaken for each of the other ones their entire lives.
they all laugh and i am still made fun of every time we play. i now always make sure to look at my wife's face prior to spanking her bottom (in public) 

my wife loves bringing this story up to embarrass me now. 

tl:dr smacked my wife's sister on the ass because they all look the same and have the same body types, didn't get murdered but get made fun of to this day for it still",4
"if two drunk people have sex it makes no sense for people to validate one person as being assaulted or raped. i see this more when its a girl accusing the guy of rape, but the fact that its socially accepted is horrifying to me. if two parties are both wasted and have sex how can one person be a rapist? the logic of too drunk to consent would make them both rapists? i will never understand this or accept it. i agree that there are some situations where maybe past behaviour indicates rapey tendencies but if its a one off event and the girl is accusing the guy of rape that should rightfully be taken with a grain of salt if they were both drunk. reduced judgement capacity due to intoxication would apply to both parties and its purely the social construction of women being vulnerable or weak that assumes the woman was taken advantage of by the man. i cannot express this to people without being called anti-women (im a woman yall) or brainwashed by patriarchal western society. 

edit: i've read some of the comments on my post and there are some things i think i should clarify. i absolutely am aware of the low conviction rate of rape cases but people seem to forget the power of social media and in general gossip which is a different kind of punishment that follows you for life. i have also personally seen someone be accused of rape after a drunken hookup and because theres an assumption that questioning anything a possible rape victim may say is considered callous and generally horrible everyone rallied around her (except me) regardless of what we all saw. im not commenting on the efficacy and complexity of the legal system as it pertains to rape cases, but making an observation based on what i have seen and what i believe to be an ultimately illogical line of reasoning in this very specific situation.

he says i'm making a decision based on anger that's i've essentially been pregnant for 14 months now.

if i agreed to be steralised - taking away also his choice of having any more children - because that's what i want?

also to add, we've discussed me using the coil but there's no birth control that's 100% effective.

edit: this has gotten more attention than i thought it would. i haven't had the chance to read all replies yet as been doing kids baths dinner etc, still need to get them to bed so will read every reply later.
just to answer a few questions that have come up so far. i wasn't sure how much info to add in my original post to not be rambly. 

fiance had always said as one of 4 he loved the madness and would want 4. i always said 4 was too many but we said we'd see how we feel after 3. we had never anticipated a still born and that steralisiation would be an option.

this past year he's been my absolute rock. he also lost a baby, but he had to hold it together while i fell apart. he's a fantastic father. this isn't a walk away from our family matter.

he's a bit of a stereotypical man in that he doesn't do talking about feelings, this is how he's always been and i accept that. he has so many other fantastic qualities. an example would be when choosing the music for our daughters funeral. he simply refused to pick. it upset him too much. you could say this is an ass hole move, however while i sat inside crying he was outside on the tranmpoline with our other 2 young children making them shriek with laughter, protecting them as best as he could.

i know in a way this is above this sub, because he's not an asshole, but i didn't want relationship advice. i just wanted to know if i would be crossing a line by doing it without his full support.

if i say i'm getting it done, he won't stop me. but he will resent me. if i don't get it done, i will resent him. 

his main concern is that its extra surgery with extra risks. second that i'm not my usual self (i'm not - i am a raging hormonal mess, with a dose of ptsd, anxiety and depression to boot thanks to our loss - however i have a fantastic counsellor and things have greatly improved). third he says there's other forms of contraception that isn't permanent. forth is my age. 

and i've had 2 c sections. 1 emergency, 1 planned. our stillborn was delivered naturally as she was premature and small so not the same risks. i have my third c section booked for the end of the month. i need to give an answer on wednesday if i want the tubal tie at the same time and we are still in disagreement, so one of us will be upset. i wanted to see if i was being an asshole for choosing my choice, of permanent steralisiation over his suggestion of the coil. 
so far it seems from comments that i'm not and i really appreciate all the replies. i will read them all xxx

edit 2. guys i was asking if i would be an asshole not if fiance is an asshole and i'm beginning to feel very protective over him with some of the comments. i'm not a baby factory in the same way he's not a sperm doner. we love each other and respect each other we just have a difference of opinion on a huge matter and we've ran out of time. whilst i'm really pleased it seems everyone is agreeing with me he's a good guy too. everything he does is for us. he's hardworking, loving and fun. he helps me with the kids after a day of manual work. he does baths and the park. he rubs my back, sends me off for baths when i ache. let's me sleep in, or nap due to pregnancy tiredness.
leaving us over this wouldn't of even entered his mind nor is it a concern of mine. we survived a stillbirth while raising 2 other young children, as a team, filling their life with joy despite the pain. we can survive anything if we've made it through the last 18 odd months x",3
"for ""allowing"" my 16yo daughter to get a tattoo?. my daughter is 16, and will be 17 in august.  in september, i'm going to move her across the country because she will be starting college at a very good school (she skipped a grade, graduated hs a year earlier than her peers).  

&#x200b;

last week my daughter graduated hs.  we packed up her room (the essentials) from her mom's house (divorced) as she wont be going back to live there...we're going straight from my house to her college dorm.  a few days ago, my daughter asks me for a ride to my friend tony's house because she is getting a tattoo.  i was surprised because she never mentioned this to me before. it was definitely framed to me as if this was already approved, she just wanted to go with me to get it done. we stayed up all night looking at designs, coming up with colorways/shading, and deciding on location.  the next day we went to tony's and she got a small 2"" x 4"" tattoo above her ankle.  i've known tony since high school, he's been a tattoo artist for 20 years.  i completely trust everything he's associated with when it comes to tattoos.  he even did my first tattoo when we were in high school.  the entire experience was actually a blast for me.  i haven't felt that close to my daughter in years, we really bonded over the whole thing.  to see the guy who gave me my first tatt also give her her first made me shed a tear.  

&#x200b;

of course the next day she posts pics online, and her mom flips her shit.  she calls me screaming about how irresponsible i am.  i honestly didn't know her mom wouldn't be ok with it.  she has tried her hardest to cut me out of all decision-making about daughter, so the norm is they make the decisions amongst themselves and i'm just sometimes along for the ride (and to pay).  she's also cut me out of multiple milestones in daughter's life.  graduations, performances, games, etc.  until daughter was old enough to tell me directly, i was never invited so i missed a lot of moments.  

&#x200b;

obviously daughter was aware of this, which is why she simply stated to me ""i'm getting a tattoo"" instead of asking me.  i definitely reprimanded her for misleading me, but otherwise, whats the big deal?  wife has been ok with her having sex since 13, picked her own high school and college, is fine with her moving across the country in a few months to attend and live by herself.  why are we acting like she is not capable of deciding this on her own?  would it be better if she gets it done 5 months from now from some shitty kid doing tatts out his dorm room with used needles?  

&#x200b;

mom is livid.  she threatened to call the police.  threatened to pick up daughter and bring her back to her house.  tried to make me take her to get the tattoo removed.  none of this is happening.  a culture was created in which i don't get input on things regarding daughter.  a culture was created in which mom allowed daughter to make decisions for herself.  here for not double checking with mom that a tattoo is ok?",3

"for eating my all of wife's toblerone, then buying a new one?. yesterday a mutual friend came over and gave her a gift of a toblerone from his holiday in switzerland. she agreed i could have some so i did. she's out for a for days and my temptation got the best of me, so i ate the rest of an almost full packet.

she has a habit of leaving food out to spoil, so i assumed it was all good to eat, but she sent me a message to make sure that there's some of the chocolate left for her. fuck, it was already gone, so i've just rushed to the shop to get a new one in expectance that i'm a dead man when she gets back. 

she once flipped out at me for eating her year old decorative pasta, so i'm not taking chances.

toblerone is replaced - with even more than there was previously. not sure if i should put it in the swiss packaging or apologize and just tell her that i bought i new one. for now i'm keeping quiet, like a parent discovering the dead goldfish and doing the ol' switcheroo. i'm in the uk btw, so the recipe is exactly the same as the one's in switzerland.

"for letting my kids reject hugs and kisses from family?. my two year old son is at an age where everyone wants to touch him and pinch him. 

my wife and i agreed we wouldn't force our kids to hug or kiss anyone because we want to teach appropriate physical boundaries and ownership of your body from an early age. 

recently my grandmother visited and when she was leaving my sister directed my son to ""give grammy a kiss goodbye"" and he said ""don't want to"" and we said ""that's fine, wave goodbye then."" and he waved and said goodbye. 

she started to say ""oh, no kiss for grammy?"" but i shut that down with ""(son) has a lot of ways to express his feelings"" and we left it at that. she seemed to understand. 

my sister took her to the airport but when she was over later she said i was an asshole for not having my son kiss his great grandmother goodbye knowing it meant something to her just because he ""didn't want to"". 

i tried to explain not wanting physical touching isn't the same as not wanting to leave the park or whatever, but she said it's not as big a deal to him to give her a quick kiss as it was for her to feel her great grandson didn't treasure her visit. 

we're about to host thanksgiving and there will be plenty of family expecting hugs and kisses and physical affection from our son, and in a couple years, from our daughter as well.

"i've kept a secret from my parents for the past 23 months, and i'm going to tell them tomorrow.. i have a fiancee that my parents would certainly not approve of, and it's being tearing me apart for the last year and a half. i met my fiancee two and half years ago, and tomorrow will be our 2 year anniversary together. we're planning on getting married this august. i couldn't be happier with her. she's funny, smart, loyal, she loves to me to death, and i feel it everyday, and on top of all of that, the best bonus any guy can ask for, she's absolutely amazing in bed. the problem? my parents and i are chinese immigrants. my mom and dad have a strong dislike for black people. my fiancee is black, and she's an immigrant herself, from ethiopia. for the past 2 years, my parents have being trying to introduce me to various chinese women and obviously, since i've brushed off all of their friend's daughters, they're starting to even suspect maybe i'm gay and don't like women. 

they've spent tens of thousands of dollars to put me through school, they paid for my living expense during my 5 years of college, not to mention raising me into an adult. now that i have a good job, an amazing girlfriend, and ready to move on in life, i fear tomorrow will be the end of our family. there is no way i'm going to give up on my fiancee, i can't see myself growing old with anyone else besides her.

**update**:

wow, i never expected this post to get this much attention. for those wanting an update, the talk went a bit better than i expected. i showed my parents pictures of my girlfriend and they were slightly disappointed. no yelling, no angry lectures like i expected. i can finally get good nights of sleep after months of insomnia stressing out over this. i'm so glad this is over.

the good parts:

1. they said they're willing to accept my girlfriend because although her skin is dark, her facial features look more like a white girl than black. i know it's really racist, but at this point, i'm just so glad they're willing to accept her, i'm not gonna argue or make any comment to them about this.

2. they're happy that she's a pharmacist. so career wise, it's another +1. 

3. they think she's actually pretty good looking, minus the dark skin obviously. again, if any of this was said by anyone besides my parents, whom i'm desperately trying to convince to accept my girlfriend, i would not be so accepting.

4. i will be bringing her to meet my parents the day after tomorrow, this sunday. i can't wait for this to happen. i've been dreaming about this day for a long time.

the bad:

this one was kinda my fault, they're not happy with the fact that i kept her a secret from them for 2 years. i did not tell them we're getting married in 3 months, i figured it's a little too much to take all at once, so i'll let them know in a month or so.",11

"for telling my daughter her ""child"" is not really my ""grandchild""?. my daughter (28) has gotten into dps and fostering, she has had her own child biologically but now plans to foster and adopt children. she has been fostering this 8mo for a month now and it's been a week-by-week process with the judge and bio family while they ""sort out"" their lives/issues that causes them to lose custody. although it appears they don't care, aren't showing up to court or meetings, failing exams, etc., so who knows where that will go. my daughter hopes to keep foster child. 

i am planning our first professional family photo in decades and am buying customized matching shirts; when i asked to confirm the size of bio child, she asked me about foster child. i told her i didn't think to include her because she's foster and therefore may be temporary and it may be weird to have her in a family photo. she said all grandchildren should be included. my thought process is, she isn't really her kid and therefore really isn't my grandchild. that would change if she were adopted, but she isn't yet. 

she went off on me and hung up and i am sitting here feeling horrible. i did not mean i do not care for the child, she's wonderful, but i thought i had a clear thought process? 

aita?

edit: i do care about this child, i'm not trying to exclude her purposely or out of spite. i just feel weird including her in our photo when /legally/ she is someone else's child still.

final edit: i accept judgment and i commented on the person's comment that made me realize why i am in the wrong. they were to the point and just made it a simple question and i understood. 

i feel the need to say that a large majority of my concern is precisely from a *legal standpoint*. i did not feel comfortable claiming this child as ours when, although her parents are being irresponsible, they are still claiming to want her back and have been in contact with the foster child's case managers (even if they're not doing what they should be as far as taking the right steps to getting custody back). maybe i should have expanded on that in my original post; if so, i apologize. 

accusations of me not caring and neglecting the child or making her feel unwelcome were..a tad bit much. i am not a heartless monster who rejects anybody who is not blood - i'm an old lady who is confused on the customs and socially acceptable behavior of a new thing (foster system) in our lives and didn't know how to act or react. 

my daughter and i called her case manager and the photo idea including fc has been shut down anyway (legalities of our state), so we are going to postpone to see if she ends up adopting fc or not to be able to include my new grandchild in the family portrait.

"for not disciplining my daughter for laying into a nosy woman at church?. my wife and i have one 14 yo adopted daughter, sarah, which is relevant to the story. we recently found out that she has pcos, which i'd never heard of before. part of that is that she has a very large ovarian cyst that requires surgery to remove. the surgery is scheduled and happening soon. right now, she looks pregnant, which can't be easy on a teenager. 

between this illness and life in general, sarah can be... moody and nobody in life is immune to fits of anger. today at church, some woman decided that sarah was in fact pregnant, and that it was her chance at a free baby. sarah went off on her, calling her a ""barren bitch"", among other things, and causing a major scene that left that woman sobbing. 

my wife thinks that sarah has anger issues, and that we should punish her for not being sensitive. i don't agree.

first off, why is that woman entitled to say anything if sarah was pregnant? infertility doesn't make you exempt from social norms. i recognize that my wife and that woman have suffered, but they don't get to just do whatever. with her medical problems, sarah will probably be infertile herself, which i think puts her on par on that point. secondly, sarah lashed out in a rage due to mental and physical pain while provoked by an outrageous encounter. i don't know that that's the same as having ""anger issues"" or a personality problem. i've had physical fights over less. maybe that nosy woman needed to learn a lesson, and did.

"for not going to my sisters wedding because of the ridiculous ""requirements"". so, i'm in the middle of a shitstorm and need some advice on if i'm wrong.

&#x200b;

my sister is getting married in less that 3 weeks. i haven't been involved in the planning as i have my own life but from what my mom has relaid to me it's been a nightmare. my sister want's a ""fancy"" wedding and is micro-managing everything. i have no idea how normal this is but from what i've heard she broke down crying when her fiance bought the wrong shade of white napkins. her and both my and the grooms parents have invested a lot of money into this too the tune of over 50k.

&#x200b;

in my opinion i think the whole ordeal is ridiculous but it's not really my place to say anything. at least until yesterday. a email was sent out to everyone invited to the wedding with ""attendance requirements"". these requirements were a joke. some of them were just nonsensical like what color ties are and aren't allowed or that no one can talk to the wife or groom alone. but some were absurd like the fact that no one is supposed to take pictures except the photographer for the whole event, no facial hair will be allowed or you will not be pictured, or that any women with shoulder length or longer hair must have it cut or wear it in a pony tail. the worst though were the ""gift requirements"". according to the email a gift of 300$ value or more must be given (or $250 cash) or you will not be allowed into the venue. the email also ends with ""those who choose not to follow these rules will be asked to leave. please think of the bride and groom's wishes during this stressful time""

&#x200b;

this is a joke, right? like i can understand micromanaging but that's just absurd. i called my mom to make sure this was not a late april fools joke and it was real. i told her that i won't be going because of this. that was wrong apparently because my sister has been blowing me up saying that i'm being selfish and that i'm ruining ""her day:. my parents agree with her and say i'm being an asshole. my parents have told me that they will pay for my gift but i still think that all of these rules are a joke.

"conflicted i am sex worker and i have alot to confess. i am sex worker and i have alot to confess

long post


i am an escort who lives in a legal location for prostitution. i have been thinking about how people view my profession and how it makes me feel among other things.




 i was reading a comment on a post the other day and i felt awful about it.
the comment was along the lines of how most girls wouldn't date a guy who has been with an escort. it made me feel that people view escorts as non human/objects.






 which honestly i'm used to. i've actually wanted to post to roast me stating i am an escort just to see if i am truly desensitized to all of the derogatory names.






the profession i am in is so much more than what it appears to be. i've substantially helped many clients with anxiety, lonliness, depression, emptiness etc. its been statistically proven that areas with access to sex workers have lower rates of suicide/homicide. at times i feel like i am a sexual therapist. i listen to these men, actually listen. it feels like a slap in the face when most people talk about "" hookers"" as objects/ gross/addicts/have daddy issues etc.  (the one thing i will admit that is stereotypical is i'm a self identified sex addict.)





 yes, some clients are only seeking something they can't fulfill outside of their relationships, but even then, i can't tell you how many times i have sat down with a client and gave them advice on how to better connect and restore their relationship. 




i've also been feeling lately that i view men and relationships so much differently now. i used be a jealous and controlling person in relationships. i am introverted by nature so when i would find someone i connected with i would put all of my energy into them and get possessive out of fear that my relationship could be jeopardized by another person. i eventually decided being alone and fixing myself was for the best.





 and now being a single provider i look at the whole idea of relationships differently. i just see people as timebombs. waiting to get bored, stagnant, resentful of one another, growing apart. it looks like a heartache.




 i also have become jaded and find men untrustworthy. (yea i know, it's fucked up to generalize a whole gender) i've met so many men who sneak around instead of being honest with their partner. and even though this is my profession i still root for them to no longer need me and fix their relationship. i fear because of being a sex worker i have been tainted to the idea of love and honesty. 





and there's times when i have no one to talk to about how i feel. how encounters with certain clients leave me emotionally bankrupt because their energy was so dark. which i guess led me to posting a confession. i don't know, i'm kind of rambling now. but there's still so much more i could vent about! i've realized in this profession there's never one way to look at everything and i'm always contradicting myself with how i feel.





all in all though i do enjoy my work. i like making people happy and helping their mental health even if it's frowned upon.


sorry if this is jumbled and hard to understand, i wrote it quickly just to vent.",11
"if i tell my sick wife that i have decided to take a vacation because she did the same to me when i had an accident?. a couple of years ago, i was in a life threatening accident. i was really lucky and i made it alive. my wife and i planned a vacation just before that. and she decided to take her best friend on the vacation while i was in the hospital. that was a week long trip to greece. 

she came back after a week and did not stop talking about how amazing the vacation was. apparently she did that to help me vicariously enjoy the vacation. i was really pissed. my sister and my family supported me. but my wife did not. she later told me that she was too  stressed and depressed to be around me and watch me suffer. 

now, my wife is down with flu. and i've been helping her. but i think i should help her vicariously enjoy europe because it's one of her favorite destinations. i just want her to know how i felt. of course, i won't go, but i plan on acting like i did. when i told my sister this, she told me that i should not get back at her and forgive her and lead by example. i don't think so. i think i'm feeling the stress now. here?

edit: so this blew up and i'm getting many responses. i only stayed for my daughter because she was a teen. she moved out now. my wife will move out after i divorce her. just wanted her to get a feel of why i divorced her.",3
"i shout out my window at 3am to mess with my neighbourhood. so, i don't do this very often but, sometimes i'll get the random impulse to literally poke my head out of my window (all the lights in my house off) and just shout a random phrase at the top of my lungs. 

example: 

*3am and everyone is fast asleep. the neighbourhood is extremely quiet, and it's so quiet, you can hear the slightest of movement*

"by accidentally taking my boyfriend on his nightmare date.. full disclosure, this happened several years ago (and he is now my ex boyfriend), but something made me remember this story today.

my ex-boyfriend was a big fan of grand gestures and surprise dates. he took me to all kinds of cool stuff to surprise me, like an obon festival, a special old school star trek movie showing, an art museum, even a surprise interstate road trip on my birthday! for his birthday, i resolved to pay him back with his own nice surprise. we had been together for \~10 months at that point, so i thought i knew what would suit him: a picnic at a beautiful outdoor conservatory, a walk around the zoo, and the surprise: tickets to a butterfly conservatory, basically a glass dome filled with lush greenery, flowers, and hundreds of butterfly species flying freely. (not this specific one, but this video gives you an idea what it's like)(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lemo5o46rso)

i had always gone to the butterfly house with my family as a little kid and i loved it soooooo much. it was special to me and i was so excited to share it with him.

he was having a great time walking around with me by the lakes and at the picnic. i kept hyping him up, saying ""i can't wait until the final surprise, i hope you love it! you're going to love it!""

we got to the entrance, they tore our tickets, and i led him in belle-at-the-library-in-beauty-&-the-beast style. i still won't shut up, trying to get him hyped. finally, the moment of truth: i took my hands off his eyes and watched him behold the kaleidoscopic beauty surrounding him.

immediately, his face blanched and he looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach.

he was cowering and clinging to my arm when a butterfly flew past him.

""umm... are you ok, dear?""

""i'm.... fine..."" he said with a classic hide the pain harold grimace.

""you don't seem fine. did something happen?""

he looked ill and muttered ""why would people pay to go to a place people let disgusting bugs land on them"". i must have looked hurt because he tried to pull himself together, put on a brave face, and grabbed my arm tight. before we could even get going any further, he pulled away from me and started shouting ""oh god, it's in your hair, it's in your hair."" before i could even tell what was going on, he had tried to run out the exit with employees chasing him, calling ""wait! we have to check you for stowaway butterflies!"" it was chaos. kids were watching him from their strollers. some were screaming and crying. 

when i finally caught up with him, he had thrown up in the trash can by the duck pond. i apologized profusely and he said it wasn't my fault - his fear of moths/butterflies just hadn't come up in conversation yet. i couldn't have known.

we just kind of stared blankly at the pond until he said, ""let's just go home."" 

it took me months before i felt comfortable trying to surprise him again, and surprise surprise, i managed to screw that up too. (it's the nightmare redux: thai surprise in the comments)

tl;dr: i accidentally traumatized my moth-phobic now-ex-boyfriend by enclosing him in a space with hundreds of butterflies. 

edit: sorry, i accidentally deleted like half this post trying to edit it. dang. i hope i cobbled it back together properly. 

1. please don't be mean, phobias are irrational by definition. it's not his fault. 
2. i was really dumb and young in this story and i don't try to surprise people anymore (unless it's something they explicitly said they wanted). i thought it was fair game to try to share something from my childhood because he had taken me to a mediocre fargo pizza place that was his favorite childhood restaurant just a few weeks earlier. 

he did also have surprise cheesecake waiting for him when he got back (favorite dessert), so at least the day wasn't destroyed completely.",4
"when buying a used car, always get a prepurchase inspection!. for the last few years i've been driving a 2009 nissan versa hatchback. it's been a  great little car, but it was old and starting to fall apart, and then i found that it was burning oil at an alarming rate. so for the past month or so i've been hunting around to see what i can find. 

&#x200b;

i found a 2014 ford focus se hatchback that had all the options i would get had i bought it new; leather interior, fog lamps, sport package (you get rear disc brakes with this, very important) and a manual transmission. focus' are super good deals right now if you get the manual, because the automatic transmissions were absolute garbage and brought down the value of the car across the board, but the rest of the car is well made. 

&#x200b;

the car was advertised around $7500 with around 71k miles, both kbb and edmunds valued the car around $8k if it was in ""excellent"" condition. so i put a deposit down on the car on the condition i could get a prepurchase inspection. on a car this old with this many miles, i didn't expect anything too crazy, and from the outside it looked and drove fine. 

&#x200b;

well guess what, it needs about $1100 of suspension work! i go back to the dealer and say ""i want to buy this car today, and i'm fine with the price it's at, but not the work it needs. to sell me this car, you can either a) fix what needs to be fixed or b) knock $1100 of the price and i'll have it fixed.""

&#x200b;

 well they decided to knock the price of the repairs off the price, and i drove off in my car. always get a prepurchase inspection on used cars, no matter how nice they look or good they drive! ",10

"your hearing is not invincible. please lower your volume when listening to music. bring earplugs to concerts. do not make the same mistake i made.. your hair cells are fragile. protect them. i made the mistake of listening to music and pretty much anything at unsafe levels. now, i pay the price of having an endless phantom ringing noise in my ear, also known as tinnitus.

this will get lost, but, at the very least, some people will see this and correct this mistake i made. 

here is a link to relative noise volumes(https://www.chem.purdue.edu/chemsafety/training/ppetrain/dblevels.htm). also, when you're outside in a bustling city or on a subway, you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you; don't do this. 

for those who don't know what tinnitus(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiajjogj0cs) is. there are many forms of tinnitus. this(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=059qomgla_o) is but one of them. 

edit: i'm glad this is reaching many people. if you have friends or family members, please inform them as well. i often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears. if you can hear someone's music through their earbuds, then it is most likely far too loud. if you google ""tinnitus definition"" and you expand the definition box, you will see that it's been on the rise lately. 

""the u.s. centers for disease control estimates that nearly 15% of the general public — over 50 million americans — experience some form of tinnitus. roughly 20 million people struggle with burdensome chronic tinnitus, while 2 million have extreme and debilitating cases.(https://www.ata.org/understanding-facts)"" 

stay safe everyone. 

edit 2: hello everyone, i've been seeing a lot of post here. thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be. just a few things to keep in mind. not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise. tinnitus can occur if you're sick, or if you have an ear infection, **earwax buildup**  or even through medication, or in rare cases if you have tmj. in these cases they may or may not be permanent (i don't want to scare you), and i would highly recommend going to your ent (ear, nose, and throat doctor) as soon as possible. also remember that just because there isn't a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life. this is important to remember. see your ent to get these ruled out! 

as /u/ohcleo mentioned, don't clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal. this is how you cause earwax blockage. 

edit3: i've been reading all of your comments. here i will include some notable suggestions i've read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have. 1) also wear earplugs while motorcycling, drumming, if you're a musician, . 

2) ***don't wear earplugs all the time, only when necessary***; wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears. 

3) **there are earplugs called ~~""etymotic""~~(just search for ""earplugs that don't muffle sound"") earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same, and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume** 4) listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage, take breaks. 

/u/ukralibre said ""thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed."" however, by then it'll be too late. take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this lpt. 

edit 4: i put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because that's important. it can lead to hyperacusis. you want to protect your ears from loud noises, not every noise. 

edit 5: for many of us tinnitus redditors, if you already have it, it's not as bad as it sounds. have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you don't even notice it anymore? or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just ""disappears"". same with your tinnitus, only it'll take a little bit longer than that.

our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities, also known as brain plasticity(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vadlld97clm). your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing, but the ringing itself will not subside. i know how ludicrous this sound, but i have i personally have habituated to the sound myself, and i'm pretty much back to my normal life. things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your t. for now, use background noise like rain drops, or white noise, perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe (on safe volumes, of course). as always, seek medical or professional help nonetheless.

"(shoulda just left my neighbor alone). im keeping names besides mine out of this for privacy. i step outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch roughly 2 hours ago and as im trying to get my lighter to work i hear crying first off my front porch to my house is enclosed by white gate wall with little holes same for the door so nobody can even see through from the outside, however i can see through from the inside ( it's nice to be able to catch scumbags trying to break into my car in the middle of the night because of this) anyway, i look for the crying it didnt sound like a child it sounded like a full grown woman. i quickly find out who is crying directly across the street from my house to the right 1 house i see my neighbor's significant other on her knees crying like she was. a. beaten up, or b. devastated from something such as a breakup. i heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. i assumed the latter. so i wanted to check if she was at the very least unharmed. i usually keep my nose out of peoples business but the inner captain save a hoe in me kicked in for some reason tbh i try to look out for my neighbors regardless my reasoning behind it is because you live next to them so you may as well be social once or twice just to know if things are going to be chill.

i walk across the street and introduce myself i have not spoken to these people before because they are never home until almost midnight and they leave around 6 a.m. damn near everyday they were very quiet and not nosy in anyway so i never attempted to talk to them when a opportunity to do so in the past arose. i say ""hi im taylor, i apologize for the intrusion i just want to make sure you aren't harmed."" clearly very upset she hardly could speak clearly and started to try to say ""he doesn't want to be with me anymore"" im relieved to know she is fine physically so im ready to say ""best of luck"" and head home. not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and its the neighbor he starts yelling is this the motherfucker you're seeing?.. how did he come to that conclusion? ( if i recognized his face sort of why cant he? ) i try to immediately say ""im your neighbor i was just trying to make sure she was unharmed."" then the woman fucks me over dragging me into the drama further she yells "" yeah, this is taylor and hes way better than you in everyway!"" my face turns red out of anger my eyes wide open and mouth agape, why the fuck would you say that? the dude likely interpreted that as why did you just tell him the truth im sure thats how he interpreted it because just as i finish saying wtf to this woman i get punched so fucking hard, i should have seen it coming he was visibly very angry. 

&#x200b;

( now i've done time in prison so i am no stranger to fighting the only reason i mention this is because i want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. i do not call cops, i do not ever run from a fight. i never ever ever stick my nose into other peoples business and i broke that rule over a woman crying.)

&#x200b;

i am on someone elses property i get hit. well i have cameras outside my house and i know that his house is within full view so i could have just called the cops and been done with it but no this is something i considered not one bit. i unloaded on this guy he was the same size and build however i was probably in better shape than him aside from my lungs. this woman that made things worse is now full blown hysterical she wailing and crying louder and harder than before and i just beat up my neighbor he beat me up too but this wasn't my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie. soft hands no calluses he absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially but he made a huge mistake as well as i. the noise from this other woman drew the attention of other neighbors now i know most of the immediate surrounding ones except 2 and guess which neighbors came to investigate?take a wild fucking guess? the neighbors i dont know and they are on the phone. (fuck..........my...........life) i decided ill go home and pull up the recording so if the police show up i have some sort of defense. i have a record and things look bad im expecting to go to jail for trespassing, assault you name it.

10 minutes later a patrol car arrived and a cop bangs on my door i have the recording on my phone so all i have to do is hand the phone to our officer and let fate decide. i gave my statement in cuffs and im in the back of the car for almost 45 minutes im thinking this is it im screwed. then the magic happened a second patrols car shows up and both officers start talking and watch the video i asked them to look at i know the first officer already saw the video almost right away so im thinking yes they believe me and dude is gonna get his. sure enough they place him in the car and the officer comes over opens the door for me and says step out  unlocks the cuffs and said im not under arrest and that my video saved my ass then they cuff the woman and throw er in the car i was in i asked why she was getting arrested she wasnt in the fight directly. and then i heard the scummiest most absolute piece of garbage thing ever. they both, the couple, tried to say i attacked the dude threatened the woman and i was trying to threaten them from calling the police what the absolute fuck. an hour ago they were against each other to the point where the woman was getting kicked out of the house. and they actually tried to get me thrown in jail. now the officer said that it looked like what they were saying was true or close to the truth when they watched the video but the audio is what made sure i was innocent they where able to hear part of  the conversation because of their yelling. never again, never will i enter drama and if my neighbor is seen again i will enjoy scaring him with intimidating looks.

"mn school is accusing me of cheating with no evidence. i'm now suspended and want access to my social media and email to prove my innocence.. i'm being accused of cheating in a math exam. i am 16 years old. i got a perfect score in the exam and the teacher asked me to stay after the class and she told me that she knows i cheated. i didn't cheat. my math has always been good except last year when i was dealing with depression. she says she knows someone of my mental faculties will never be able to get a perfect score so i must have cheated.

i told her that i didn't cheat and i'm offended at the accusation. two days ago i was asked to see the principal who said the same thing, that i should confess to cheating and tell them how i did it so that they can stop other students from doing it. he more or less threatened me ""this can go very well or very bad for you depending on your cooperation with us.""

i told him that i'm happy to retake a new exam right now or at any other time to prove that i didn't cheat but he said that i could have had time to prepare since the time my teacher talked to me. i told him that if their evidence for my cheating is my lack of mental faculties then no amount of studying should make a difference? he still did not agree for me to take another exam to prove that i could get that score.

yesterday i was asked to his office again and he told me that he knows about how some students are cheating and offered me a clean slate if i let them access my social media and emails to find out who they are and if i give them evidence of other students cheating he will let me retake the exam. i have no knowledge of what he is talking about and i declined access to my social media and email.

i'm now suspended for disobedience of school staff and lack of cooperation for proving my innocence from a cheating charge. this to me sounds very unfair and i can't help but feel like i'm being targeted here for maybe a personal reason? because this does not make any sense. they have no evidence that i cheated and refused my offer of retaking the exam and they insulted my intelligence.",2

"by letting my nephew play with my google home mini. i live alone and like to set up my place as 'smart' as possible. so i have smart lights, speakers, smart locks and some other stuff set up. i set up a few 'joke' routines on google assistant that i would show my friends for a laugh.

"one day, a wife came home early and found her husband in their bedroom making love to a very attractive young woman. naturally, she was very upset.. ""you are a disrespectful pig!"" she cried. ""how dare you do this to me! i'm a faithful wife, the mother of your children! i'm leaving you. i want a divorce right away!""

the husband replied, ""hang on just a minute love, so at least i can tell you what happened.""

""go ahead,"" she sobbed, ""but they'll be the last words you'll say to me!""

so the husband began, ""well, i was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. she looked so down and out and defenseless that i took pity on her and let her into the car.

i noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. she told me that she hadn't eaten for three days. so, in my compassion, i brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas i made for you last night. the ones you wouldn't eat because you're afraid you'll put on weight. the poor thing devoured them in moments!

since she needed a good clean-up, i suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, i noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so i threw them away. then, as she needed clothes, i gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don't wear because you say they are too tight.

i also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don't wear because i don't have good taste. i found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for christmas that you don't wear just to annoy her and i also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don't wear because someone at work has a pair the same.""

"by going on my first date in years. so usual disclaimer, this happened last week not today but i've only just recovered enough to talk about it. 

also for context i am a detective with the police which was on my profile.

so i have been single a few months now and finally decided to give those tinder style apps a go. i was recommended bumble by a colleague which is essentially just tinder but bee themed.

i downloaded the app thursday and by friday i had a date so i thought things were going well. first date i arrange for saturday at a busy shopping centre.

now i've been out of the dating game for a while and we were chatting about movies so we went to go to the cinema to see mortal engines.

i knew the first greeting was always going to be awkward, the whole ""hey is that x? 《you now have 1 second to decide on kiss on cheek, awkward hug or lame wave thing》 but what happened was none of those things. instead i get hit with "" tell me who you are i need to verify you"" which not going to lie is as romantic a greeting as smearing yourself with marmite and announcing ""let's have a toast for the pretty lady!""

anyway she then asks ""what's that on the floor"" pointing to a large pile of dust. it's a pile of dust i tell her and she makes me double check.

dust confirmed we move on to the cinema and purchase tickets the announcer in my brain exclaimes 《you are now locked into the date》

we got an hour and a half till the movie so we grab some ice cream cause that's cute as shit and head to starbucks (which fyi is a crowded mutherflucker) grab a table and she leans close... zero chill just dead pan asks me ""...what's the darkest job you have ever dealt with..."" 

now i've got some h.p. lovecraft dark stories so i try to give her a pg version of a double murder i had some involvement with. (note: everything i discussed could also be easily read about online)

""how did he kill them? was there a lot of blood? did you see it? was it like the movies? i love murder stories, have you seen making a murderer? have you heard about x murder? did you know this one guy once chopped his mum's head off and had sex with the corpse isn't that facinating?!?!""

(let me just remind you it's as crowded as balls in leather pants in this coffee shop and people are looking over)

she also hits me with a few probing questions ""have you ever committed a crime? have you ever done drugs?!""

trying to recover some semblance of a date i joke ""haha only if you count downloading showbox as a crime""

next it's my turn to ask some questions and throw out the classic ""tell me about your self"" (i know it's lame but i panicked)

""oh i've just been released from 18 months locked up in a psyche ward in broadmoor, it was pretty much a doss and i got to meet people like naked phillip""

now gripped with what can only be described as the terror a double d breasted woman feels in a slasher flick i decide i have two choices.

1) run into the crowd and disappear

2) continue date (what could go wrong in a cinema? it's just 2 hours of awkward silence)

let's just say i chose poorly...

before we move off though she asks me to search her chair... i don't really do much except say it's fine but after walking off she decides my efforts were not good enough and goes back to search it properly.

finally into the cinema now 10 minutes after start time so it's adverts but most people have sat down... of course there are people in our seat, what looks like a family of 14 parts like the red sea so we can sit in the seats we paid for but they are somewhat miffed.

suddenly my date whips out the flashlight on her phone and starts search the chair! the woman from the family is also some nutbar and starts yelling ""my eyes! turn off that light!! arrghhfyfbifwyh""

my date sits down in darkness for a whole 5 minutes before deciding that she wants to have a round two of flashlight rodeo.... cue raging snickers lady ""i'm going to knock you out i told you turn that light off"" 

i'm not about to white knight defend this woman, i'm a god damn spectator here! the fruit and nut villain is eventually calmed down by her fella.

date goes for lucky number 3 flashlight gamble, this time i have to step in and say thus is not ok.

so movie time. i'm sure mortal engines is a fine film... but it's pretty out there and loooong. all i'm thinking about is the 3 pieces of advice i was given prior to app dating

1) don't get drunk
2) don't send dick pics
3) don't stick your dick in crazy 

so despite the horror movie mortal engines has become i am still a man and she is still an attractive woman so i'm repeating number 3) again and again in my head like a monk trying to achieve enlightenment. lucky the date is so bad and my fear so palpable that logic wins out.

after the movie she goes to the bathroom and hands me her coat and bag, can't run yet... got to wait...

she returns dead serious ""i need you to follow me""

this is where i die i think, i'm being lured to the bathroom to be filleted like a fish and used as a skin suit in some crazy sex game.

she walks me to an isolated area and points at an especially large pile of dust

""what's that?""

i say just a large pile of dust ""are you sure, can you check"" 

sure enough it's just dust...

next she smashes out a ""you know the overground train for me is an hour wait.... i don't really want to wait an hour... so thirsty...""

"a lady at my gym suffered a seizure in the woman's locker room - she's now threatening to sue. i am 16 years old.. (pennsylvania) hi there,

i am a 16 year old junior in high school and work part-time at a gym.  i generally open the gym on weekends at 7 am, and am alone in the building until our housekeeping staff come in at 8:00.
it starts out slow as members come in, and usually picks up around 9 when our sales staff and general manager come in.  the gym is a two story facility.

earlier this morning around 8ish, i was approached by another member who stated there was a woman in the locker room (downstairs) who was laying on a bench shaking and presumably having a seizure.  so i run downstairs to the locker room, and sure enough, there is a woman shaking uncontrollably, but breathing.  i had my cell phone with me and immediately called 911.  i stayed on the phone with the dispatcher while waiting for the emts and paramedics who arrived about five minutes later.

the dispatcher stated i should absolutely not try to perform cpr/first aid (i am licensed) or move her, only to hold on to her make sure she did not fall off the bench.  the emt's manage to revive? (i'm not sure if that is the appropriate term here) her and she gets wheeled out of the gym and to the hospital. i'd say we were in the locker room for about 20 minutes trying to convince her to go -- she was very stubborn.  there was a personal trainer who was there to help me with whom i am extremely grateful for.  i filled out an incident report and filed it with our gm when he came in.

we have had concerns with this member before, as she has health issues.  the thing is, i have absolutely no idea how long she was suffering from a seizure for.  it looked as if she was in the midst of changing in to gym gear when it happened.  she checked in shortly after 7:15 am.

i just received a text message from my gm and she is now threatening to sue us for her seizure.  can she come after me personally??  as i said, i have no idea how long she was in that state for and i am terrified!  thank you in advance for your answers!",2
"as a caddie, i once stole money from an older gentleman. i worked as a caddie and fore caddie for about 1 month of a summer when i was \~15.  i got booked as a fore caddie for a group of 4 older gentleman (probably late 60s).  after the round, the one who was the member of the club said to me ""good job today.  i'll go get my wallet from the locker room to pay you"".  

in the meantime, his buddies came up and said ""thanks for your help today"" and handed me $60.  i said thank you and went to leave.  on my way out, i ran into the member who yelled out to me and handed me $40.  i didn't tell him  that his buddies already took care of it, so i walked off with $100.  i never went back there again.

i know he is rich and $40 is nothing, but i still feel bad about it.  they were a nice group of guys to work for.  this was 15 years ago and i still think about him.",11

"a real, effective apology has three parts: (1) acknowledge how your action affected the person; (2) say you're sorry; (3) describe what you're going to do to make it right or make sure it doesn't happen again. don't excuse or explain.. most people treat an apology as a way to explain their point of view. but that feels to the listener like making excuses or minimizing their experience. 

say your roommate accidentally ruins your  couch by spilling a big cup of coffee on it. think about which you'd rather hear. 

mediocre apology: 
""i'm so sorry! i just got startled when my phone buzzed and i accidentally knocked it over. it was totally an accident. i feel terrible.""

good apology:
""i know you really like the look of that couch, and now it's got a stain on it - you must be really bummed about that. i'm so sorry. i'd be happy to pay for a cleaning, and in the future, i'll keep my drinks in the kitchen. 

edit: reading through the comments, i think i should clarify. i'm talking about situations where you feel bad about something you did or said, and want to clear the air with an apology. this is not applicable to situations where you feel you did nothing wrong, or don't want to apologize.

"people obsessed with sports are just as nerdy as people into video games or dungeons and dragons.. title says it pretty well. don't get me wrong i'm a huge sports fan, i like teams in the ncaa, nfl, and mlb. i follow them all very closely. i am a nerd because of that. i sit alone and watch games and yell and carry on, but so many people are in denial about this.

there are people that literally play sports in high school and then go to college for sports management, kinesiology, or sports marketing. that should garner just as much criticism as majoring in psychology, gender studies, and sociology. those degrees are completely useless if you don't get a job like selling tickets for your local college team.

we all know someone who is that ""sports are my life guy"" 

also so many of the people that give people shit calling them losers or nerd for playing things like league of legends or d&d are these sports nerds. there's guys that will wear a jersey of their favorite team out to dinner just because, if they saw someone wearing a cosplay in the same setting they'd probably give them unrelenting shit.

again nothing wrong with being a sports fan, but let's call a spade a spade. sports fanatics are nerds too, they need to embrace it.

"in year 12 i lied to my science teacher, saying i handed in an assignment that i never even started. i ended up getting a b+ on it.. ok so i was taking year 12 multi-science, which was basically the deadshit version of the real science classes available at my school (biology, chemistry  and physics). it wasn't too bad, it just wasn't as practicable as the other science classes.

so 8 weeks out from the end of the term (meaning end of class, start of holidays), we got this assignment. i honestly don't know what it was about, because i didn't do it, but it was this stack of pages that we needed to fill out.

long story short, i didn't do any of it. not a word.

the day finally came when we had to hand the assignment back in. it was a normal lesson, but at the end of the lesson the teacher said ""ok assignments are due today, everyone hand them up"" and everyone shuffled up to the front of the room and put their assignments on his desk in a pile. i didn't get up and he didn't notice.

the next day the teacher came up to me and at morning tea:

 teacher: mattio, your assignment wasn't in the pile with the others, where is it?


me: what, no, i handed it up yesterday?? i specifically remember it because (student) handed his up before mine.


teacher: yeah..ok. i'll have another look.


i ended up getting a b+ on that assignment. at the time i thought i'd pulled a quick one on a stupid adult authority figure and gotten away with it, which felt really cool, but i learned a couple of years later that i was on suicide watch at the time, so that probably had something to do with the leniency.",11

"my 30 m wife 30 f lied to me about where she was yesterday.. update: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/al02i9/update_my_30m_wife_30f_lied_to_me_about_where_she

i hate that i'm having to write this but here it goes.

my wife of 6 years and partner of 14 has been studying a lot lately for a certification she wants to get related to her job. she mostly studys at home but will often go to a library or starbucks if she really needs to focus. we aren't the kind of people that are incredibly co-dependent and we each have our own set of friends and time for ourselves that the other understands.

this does require quite a lot of trust as i've found that people that get exceedingly jealous of their partners are usually the ones that are the most dependent/controlling of them. well yesterday that trust was shaken a bit for me.

my wife told me that after work she was going to study and then head to the gym. she has a scheduled class at her gym and didn't want to run all the way home and all the way back in the snow and ice so she was just going to study at the library and then head over.

it occurred to me after a few hours though that yesterday was mlk day and all the library's were closed. no big deal, i figured she'd just go to a panera or something and then head to her class. when she gets home, she's in her full gym outfit but she's still in full makeup and runs right upstairs to take a shower. i asked her how her day went and she said ""it was good. the library was good, i got a lot done and the gym was difficult today which i liked."" i didn't say anything to her about the library being closed and thought the whole thing was odd. while she was in the shower i decided to get on facebook because the gym that she goes to has a page and they put updates with pictures on there for marketing and what not.

there were only 4 people in the class other than the instructor and my wife wasn't in any of them.

i haven't said anything to her about it yet and i can't help but suspect the worst. it is very unlike her to hop in the shower right after getting home like that, she usually eats dinner and then hops in really late at night. anyway, i don't really know what to do or how to bring it up to her without sounding paranoid.

edit 1: i called the library and they confirmed they were closed yesterday. the gym is also really a kickboxing fitness thing and it's only one big room with a bunch of heavy bags - the pics were from when my wife said she was there and she's definitely not in any of them.

edit 2: so i came home for lunch after reading all the messages. pretty much half of you are saying talk to her and the other half saying ""collect more evidence"". so i'm torn. 

i did, while i'm here at the house, peak into her gym bag and found this http://i.imgur.com/dnq74ds.jpg . there are some gym gloves, hand wraps, sunglasses, headphones... and sexy red underwear. i don't know what the logical explanation for it would be other than the obvious... this sucks. 

morning update: wow... so thanks to everyone who reached out about this. it was impossible to read all the comments and reply to every message but i really appreciate it.

i decided not to confront my wife about this last night and instead confide in my best friend who i've know practically my whole life. he was on the ""wait it out, collect evidence"" bandwagon. i haven't begun to do that yet but i will in the next few days.

last night she did tell me that she was going to do the study/gym thing again today and would be back around the same time as monday. again, this is somewhat typical for her. i have a second job that i work tuesday / thursday and so m/w are usually her gym days. what is a little strange is the studying away from home again. she does is sometimes but it's rare and i can't remember when she left to study back to back away from home. she gets off work around 3:00 each day and the gym class ends around 7:30, so she's got 4.5 hours to do whatever if she wanted. 

addressing some of the most popular comments from the comment section.

1. ""how do you know that she wasn't just at a boudoir thing"". i guess anything is possible, we don't live in the largest town and there is only one place i could find online that even advertises that they do stuff like that. i doubt they would give out any information but it just doesn't seem realistic that this is the answer. that's a lot of trouble and lying to go through just to take some pictures. the other part is that i am going out of town this weekend, leaving friday night and returning sunday and she will be all alone to do whatever she wants. if she was doing a boudoir thing she wouldve waited until my trip that has been planned for a while and not do it on a holiday.

2. the gym photo. i do know the photo is from monday 100%, there are hashtags and other things on the facebook post that solidify that. i also checked their instagram later and there were more pictures from monday as well. however it could be from a different time of day as you guys have suggested and not when she said she was there.


i will say for some added context that she has seemed different the past few months, especially sexually. i don't want to get too graphic or anything but she's kind of become fixated on doing new things and being more provocative. i honestly feel like an affair is the only answer. that's all for now, i might update in a few weeks if anything changes. thanks guys. 

oh and shoutout to u/vh3m for saying she couldn't be cheating because ""she is fat and no one would want to sleep with that hippo."" you sound nice.

"in an era of 'treat yourself' make sure it's within your personal budget. i've noticed in the last few years a lot of people use ""treating themselves"" as an excuse to overspend. i agree that you should treat yourself! it's so much easier to live within a budget when you do, however, my tip is budget for this and don't over indulge!

personally, as a broke university student, eating out on campus once every two weeks is such a treat that i look forward to. too often i see fellow students overindulging in things like fake nails and eyelashes (or male equivalent buying overpriced clothing/food/beer); treating themselves when they didn't budget for it and end up short on money.

"irs: refunds worth $1.1b waiting to be claimed by those who have not filed 2014 federal income tax returns!. **don't let the government hold onto your money!**

washington ― unclaimed federal income tax refunds totaling about $1.1 billion may be waiting for an estimated 1 million taxpayers who did not file a 2014 federal income tax return, according to the internal revenue service.

to collect the money, these taxpayers must file their 2014 tax return with the irs no later than this year's tax deadline, tuesday, april 17.

""we're trying to connect a million people with their share of $1.1 billion in unclaimed refunds for 2014,"" said acting irs commissioner david kautter. ""time is running out for people who haven't filed tax returns to claim their refunds. students, part-time workers and many others may have overlooked filing for 2014. **and there's no penalty for filing a late return if you're due a refund.""**

the irs estimates the midpoint for the potential refunds for 2014 to be $847; half of the refunds are more than $847 and half are less.

in cases where a federal income tax return was not filed, the law provides most taxpayers with a three-year window of opportunity for claiming a tax refund. if they do not file a tax return within three years, the money becomes the property of the u.s. treasury. for 2014 tax returns, the window closes april 17, 2018. the law requires taxpayers to properly address, mail and ensure the tax return is postmarked by that date.""

"for using poop bags for my daughter's birthday party?. my daughter just turned 6. we had a birthday party for her on saturday. that morning was pretty hectic. i was outside setting up and suddenly my wife comes outside yelling about how the grocery store screwed up the birthday cake and i didn't notice.

all that happened was that they spelled our daughter's name as ""sarah"" and it's ""sara"" and i said, ""who cares, just scrape off the h"" but she insisted on returning it. so i said ""fine whatever."" and then as she's leaving she says since i screwed up already i should make upfor it by finishing the decorations. 

and i go into the kitchen and i ask my daughter, ""what's the most important thing?"" she says ""the gift bags."" i found all the candy and toys and what i thought were the bags they were supposed to go into. so i make up the bags, my daughter helps, and she thinks they look great and she's happy with them.

my wife comes home and takes over, satisfied by the new cake and the attempt i made at helping. so a little while after that, the guests arrive. the day went pretty well until the end. my daughter reminds us that they need to hand out gift bags. my wife panics thinking she forgot about them, but she says ""dont worry, dad made them"" and she looked so relieved until i got the box. she looked inside an was horrified

""what the fuck is this?"" she whispers. and she thrusts the box back at me and rushes to the bedroom. i follow her and find her sitting on the bed crying. she's so embarrassed. why? she wont say. i'm not sure what to do because people are trying to leave and they're confused as to whats going on. i then i just take over ""goodbye"" duty and hand out the bags to kids at the door and say bye with my daughter.

well halfway through doing that my wife came back out and took the box from me and brought it into the bedroom and threw it on the ground. wtf? she finally tells me ""those are dog poop bags"" and basically i'm stupid and i've ruined all the hard work she put into the party.

well, reddit, they dont look like ""dog poop"" bags. they're just small pink bags with hearts on them. who really cares? i tell her ""it's not like they're dirty. they're small bags like any other bags"" and damn it she freaked. she says she's so mortified she doesnt even want to show her face at the school anymore.

so yeah i've been bringing my daughter to school every day this week (which has been making me late for work). my wife will barely even speak to me even though my daughter thinks everything was fine. she laughed when i told her they were really dog poop bags. my wife got even more mad at me for telling her. i told my wife she needs to chill and she basically said i was a huge asshole and she's mad that i dont think it's a big deal. and i still dont. actually, i think i'm the one that should be mad at her for keeping this going for almost a week.

so, reddit, aita?

tl;dr: i used dog poop bags as goody bags by accident for 6 year old daughter's bday party",3
"by being so pregnant i couldn't see what i was wearing before i went on stage. this just happened a couple of hours ago. i am 8 months pregnant and *huge*. so i am in the choir at my church, and we were singing a special christmas song, so everyone was supposed to dress festively. i also had to sing a solo before the message, which i was *very* nervous for. 

i picked out a nice red maternity dress with beading on the collar and wore black tights with black velvet kitten heels. i even painted my nails to match. 

the first service went smoothly... but when i got home, i noticed i had prominent underarm sweat showing on my dress. *great*, that's probably what everyone was staring at during my solo, lol. so i was determined to prevent this from happening in the second service an hour later. i took off the dress, dried it off, and changed into some pajamas to have breakfast. i also put on an undershirt and stuffed a bunch of tissues under my arms so i wouldn't sweat next time.

before i knew it, i was running a bit behind, so i put my dress and shoes back on and hustled out the door. i got to the church a minute before the service started and rushed out of my car. someone asked if it was too windy for me. we're in south florida, so i had no idea what they were talking about and continued rushing for the doors. 

unfortunately, the service began a moment earlier and the choir was already on stage. i grabbed my songbook and lumbered onto the stage from the middle aisle, to my place front and center with the other sopranos. everyone smiled at me awkwardly, which i figured was due to my tardiness.

we started with a hymn... that's when i realized i felt too much fabric around my legs for the kind of dress i was wearing. i worried that the tissues from my arms had fallen and people could see them stuck to my tights or something. i could not see past my belly easily, so i leaned over to check, as conspicuous as it was to do so...

the sight and accompanying horror took a moment to register. there they were, my pink and teal flamingo print pajama pants. still on my legs. and the whole audience sees them. how the freak did i not notice, and how did i get on stage without anyone telling me?!? 

i rushed off the stage mid-song and took the offending pants off in the bathroom, then waddled back up to my spot. i couldn't even run off afterwards and hide, because i had to sing a solo immediately after that! on the bright side, my stage fright for that was gone...

tldr: changed clothes in a hurry between performances at church. unintentionally sang on stage wearing flamingo pajama pants because i'm huge and can't see my legs. ",4
"for accusing my brother of replacing my wife's refrigerated breast milk with cow milk?. my wife and i had our first baby a month ago. she prefers to pump a few bottles worth of milk at a time and feed the baby from the bottle. she stores the bottles in the fridge. 


my little brother has never had a girlfriend. he acts quite awkward around my wife and other women from what i've seen. he came to my house last week to see the baby and he noticed the bottles in the fridge. 


yesterday, my wife and i, along with our baby, went over to my parent's house. my brother knows since he's in our family group chat. he texted me when i was at my parent's house that he bought my baby some cool clothes and will drop them off. he knows my front door pin to get in. 


when i got home i saw the cool clothes he bought and thanked him via text. my wife bottle fed my baby that night with no issues. today, however, she said the baby reacted very differently to the new bottle she fed her. she coughed much more than usual and spat out the milk, which never happened before. so, my wife tasted it and said it was cow milk, not her milk. she told me to taste it too and compare it with the two other bottles in the fridge. that bottle indeed tasted much more like cow milk than the other two.


my wife suspected it was my brother drinking her breast milk and swapping out that bottle with cow milk. i agreed that it would not be out of character for him to do that. i thought it was a bit fishy he would come by and drop off clothes, especially since that was the first time he would come to my house when no one was home. 


i called my brother and asked him why he would drop by when we were not home and why he couldn't wait a few hours until we got home. he said he just bought the clothes from the nearby mall and it was more convenient to drop them off then. i asked him to please tell me the truth if he swapped my wife's breast milk with cow milk and he vehemently denied it. i told him how we found out the bottle contained cow milk and what a coincidence it must be. he said he really doesn't know, but i could hear the tremble in his words. i told him that my wife and i don't believe him and if he doesn't apologize now, we would tell our parents what happened and ask what they think. he once again denies doing anything so i hung up. 


before calling my parents, i want to know what you guys think first. are my wife and i just paranoid or do we have good enough reason to believe my brother swapped out her breast milk with cow milk?",3
"for inviting my sons entire class except for one child because of his autism?. my sons 10th birthday is next saturday and me and my husband have been planned a party for him. to make sure we gave everyone enough time we got invitations ready 2 weeks in advance and i had my son pass them out friday. we invited every one in his class (he goes to a small private school so there were only 15 kids to invite). except for one child well call david. 

the school my son goes to has a program for special needs kids where they are put into a ""normal"" class once a week. david is a high functioning autistic child who was put in my sons class to help him socialize and to help the other kids learn to not discriminate against special needs people. from what i know about him and his mother they are just doing their best, and i have nothing against either of them. however, there have been incidents with david before. last year through friends i had heard that david had a meltdown at another party he was invited to. i don't know if i believe it but parents who were there say that it was because he wanted to open presents like the birthday boy and when told no freaked out. there are other logistical problems as well (the party will be in a loud arcade) so in the end i decided to not invite david. 

well, after my son passed the invitations word spread around that we had excluded the special needs child in his class. this got back to davids mother who called me last night and confronted me about this. she told me that i am awful for excluding her son and that i'm teaching my son to discriminate. when i brought up the logistics and the past incident she told me that i'm an asshole for assuming what her son can and cant do before hanging up. i woke up this morning to a passive aggressive post by her and many other parents are siding with her. 

i just want my son to have a good party and didn't mean anything by this. aita?",3
"i 59m cut two of my kids 24f28m out of my will for his irresponsible spending of their previous inheritance. how should i fix this situation?. my (now deceased) ex-wife and i have 5 kids together: 21f, 24f, 28m, 30m, 35m.

a few years ago their mother passed away and left each of them a very large inheritance. over 300k gbp each, evenly distributed among them.

prior to her passing she made it clear to them that this money was not to be wasted. it was to: 1. used to pay off debt, 2. used to further education, 3. put towards buying a house in future.

two of my kids, 24f and 28m, have completely squandered this money in just a couple of years. my daughter spent it **all** travelling across the world care-free staying in nice hotels and eating fancy dinners. i completely understand going on a vacation, **but to blow all of it on travel against her mother's wishes?** bloody shameful.

my son is even worse. he has literally spent it all on drugs, alcohol, and escorts over this time. none of it, **none**, going towards self-improvement as their mother wanted.

so i continued to hound them over this time and time again until, as expected, it's all bloody wasted. once this happened, i decided to cut them both out of my will, as i don't want my hard-earned money being squandered so my children can live a hedonistic lifestyle for a couple of years.

i told this to their siblings in confidence, so that they would be prepared to deal with the fall-out when i eventually pass. one of them (not sure who) let it slip to them, and now they've gone off the deep-end and proclaimed i'm ""dead to them"" and they ""don't have a dad"" etc.

i don't want to go into a long bitter fued with my kids, but damned if i'm going to have my life savings wasted by them also.

any advice on how to fix this?",7

"a teenage boy was delivering papers to an apartment house.. a teenage boy was delivering papers to an apartment house. while there, a stunning young woman came out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing only a robe. the boy smiled at the young woman and she started up a conversation with him. as they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. the poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.

after a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, ""let's go to my apartment, i hear someone coming.""

he followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. now nude, she purred at him, ""what would you say is my best feature?""

flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, ""it has to be your ears.""

astounded, and a little hurt she asked, ""my ears? look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. i work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. i have a 28 inch waist. look at my skin, not a blemish anywhere. how can you think that the best part of my body is my ears?""

when they moved in it became instantly apparent it was not just a couple, it was a couple, 2 kids, and another man. we immediately told our landlord, and the couple would keep re-iterating they are allowed to have guests. landlord has told them no they cannot do this as it is not safe as the unit is overcapacity, but they just have ignored him.

those guests have now been here for over a month, our landlord is trying to evict them through the ltb. but it has left me and my roomate in an extremely shitty situation. on top of this our landlord has basically told us if he lets us ether of us out of the lease then the family will completely take over the entire apartment, and he won't be able to re-rent it.

the family eats my food, i can't leave anything outside of my locked room. last week the father and mother got into a huge screaming argument (that i cannot understand) which led to a domestic abuse incident which terrified me, my roommate called the police and the father was removed. he came back the next day and they have been arguing and screaming every other night.

last night i invited a friend back to my place only for the father to start screaming at me accusing me of basically being a whore and then trying forcibly force my friend out of the apartment before i called the police. the police came i explained the situation, and after a bunch of back and forth he finally let my friend enter the apartment. i broke down when explaining the whole situation to the police officer, and while he empathized with me he told me it was a domestic issue.

i am sick of this, i want out now. my roommate's lease is up at the end of august but is planning to just move into her boyfriends and just eat the cost. i don't have that luxury unfortunately, and i am terrified of how this is going to go when she is gone.

"i am afraid for my life and those of my children.. my husband is active duty navy. we have been married 11 years and have three boys together, ages 5, 2, and 2 months old.

he's always been verbally and emotionally abusive to me but lately it's escalated. in december he got mad out of nowhere while driving and began driving erratically. i thought we were going to crash. he pounded the steering wheel and broke the blinker handle thing off. when we got home he screamed at our 5 year old and kicked a hole in our wall. he'd never done that before. the next day i faked a pregnancy issue and had him take me to the hospital. i told my midwife what happened and asked for a social worker. cps was called and investigated about two weeks right around christmas. they closed the case despite me telling them that he'd said he would rather we all be dead than i leave him again. (we were separated for sox months over a year ago.) they said he wasn't an immediate danger after speaking to our five year old and him having told them he was afraid of his dad. since the case has closed my husband's behavior has not improved. i caught him pushing my two year old over on the sidewalk after he ran off. he grabbed my five year olds arm and shook it when he wouldn't drop his ds and left bruises. he has screamed at all of us and hinted that he would not let me leave alive.

we just moved into a new apartment and now he is underway until next week. i feel like this is a good time to do something but am scared of reporting him since nothing happened last time and because of the murder/suicide hints.

i have no other family or friends

i have money set aside in cash, but no access to his income and he took me off our joint account last year.

when we were separated last year it was from an infidelity issue and i had found pictures of him naked under a tree by a park inside our military housing. i don't know who took the pictures but i sent then to his command thinking they'd force him to get counseling. instead they told him i was causing his career trouble. they didn't help us get access to income either and ultimately i came back last march because we were about to be homeless. i then got pregnant.

"mashed potatoes with unpeeled skins are far superior to mashed potatoes without the skin. title says it, i do t know how unpopular this is, but in my opinion, mashed potatoes should by default be made with non-peeled potatoes, and i have three reasons why.

1.) they taste better:
the skin adds a chewy aspect to it rather then it being just a slurry you swallow, you actually chew the food...crazy

2.). it wayyy easier:  
no need for a fuck ass peeler, don't have to clean it, plus they're kinda scary.  all you need to do for the potatoes is scrub them under some warm water, what a bother.

# quick update:

i texted kyle yesterday and he replied. i asked him how he was feeling. he said he was even more sick than earlier. i said i was too, and i said it was his fault (in a joking way, because it was just as much my fault too). i told him about how i had a volunteer thing at university which i went to and how i nearly fainted because of my fever and ended up coming home early. but that was it. we didn't talk about much else because he stopped responding.

in addition to this, i haven't called the number my ta gave me because they are only open monday - friday from 8am to 4pm. so, i'm going to be doing that on monday, hopefully.

# my condition:

the exact name for my condition is mayer-rokitansky-küster-hauser syndrome, or mrkh syndrome for short. it affects 1 in every 5000 women. a lot of people, i'm assuming they were trolls, stated that i was a guy or something along those line. just to clarify, i am a woman, i look like a woman physically and i've felt like a woman my whole life. i was genetically born with xx chromosomes. being a woman is not something i doubt.

there are basically 2 types of branches within mrkh. type 1 is an isolated occurrence, meaning there is only a lack/underdevelopment of internal reproductive organs. type 2 is more serious as it is also associated with auditory, vertebral, renal, and cardiac issues. this may include hearing loss, bent or curved spine, missing kidney, etc. i have type 1. there are a lot of variations for each woman and to what extent they are affected by this. i am mainly going to be talking about my individual case.

# diagnosis:

a lot of people were confused as to why i was only diagnosed with this a year ago and not at birth, and why did i find out after already being with my ex for over a year.

the way mkrh works is that it affects internal reproductive organs. this means that just by looking on the outside, it is undetectable. from the outside, i look like a normal female. i have normal external genitalia, including a clitoris, urethra, labia, etc. i am missing the vaginal opening, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and my ovaries are underdeveloped. my ovaries contain a few eggs, and they function enough to produce lower levels of estrogen, which is why i am still physically able to look like a female. for me personally, instead of a vaginal opening, i have something called an indentation or 'dimple'. for 18 years of my life, i lived thinking i was just like any other girl. i never once suspected anything wrong.

when i started dating my ex, we never attempted to have sex because neither of us were ready. but this was around the time i started to feel like something was wrong. one main reason was that i hadn't started my period, and the second being the fact that i wasn't able to insert a finger inside my vagina. for some reason, at the time, i assumed periods and fingering went together. i thought that once a girl got her period, her vagina ""opened"" and the barrier fell out or something like that. its weird looking back at that now haha.

i went to the doctors one day (this was before i started dating my ex) with my mom after she started getting worried about me not getting my period. this is probably one of the most common ways women with mrkh find out about it. the doctors simply assumed that i was a late bloomer, and told me to fix up my diet and workout. i was underweight at the time, around 82lbs with a height of 5ft or 152cm. i was referred to a pediatrician who did absolute jackshit about my situation. the following year, i got my shit together on my own. i joined the wrestling team, track team, and i started doing weight training. as a result of this, i was also eating way more, and i gained a lot of muscle mass. i got my weight up to 120lbs. when i still hadn't gotten my period, i went back to the doctors. they still didn't take it too seriously, telling me that some women don't get their periods until they turn 20 or something, or asked me about my family history. i had multiple blood tests done, showing my levels were completely normal. i didn't feel like everything was normal, so i switched around doctors, seeing different specialists, and pediatricians, getting more and more blood tests done each time. needless to say, i was getting tired of blood tests because i knew they didn't show anything. one doctor said my prolactin levels were too high, but i think that was circumstantial. prolactin is the hormone that produces breast milk in pregnant women, and she kept insisting that i had breast discharge which is something i had never experienced before in my life. some how, i can't exactly remember which doctor, i ended up getting put on birth control pills as an attempt to ""reset"" my biological functions and induce a period. i diligently took the bc pills every day. nothing happened. this is when i thought, ""is it just me or does healthcare in canada suck?"".

then another doctor suggested i get a pelvic ultrasound done. this is when they found the issue. the poor lady who did my ultrasound spent over an hour looking for my uterus which didn't even exist. the doctor did a pretty terrible job of telling me the news, in all honestly. she stood at the door, ultrasound reading in hand, with the door wide open, and told my mom i had mrkh. she said according to the ultrasound i had an underdeveloped uterus (this ends up being false later). she literally didn't even spend 2 mins talking about it and left. i walked back to the car with my mom, she was crying as she called my dad and told him the news. his response was just to start swearing, not knowing he was on speaker phone and i could hear him. and then he said, ""its okay, just forget it"". i came home, and i did some googling and started to learn more about mrkh. i had already been with my ex for over a year up till this point, and i texted him while he was at work, and told him about it. i also added that if it changed anything between us, that i would understand, and i wouldn't hold it against him. as much as i might hate him now, he was the only one who ever handled this news properly, which is something i really needed at the time.

after the initial news, my doctor handed my file over to a sickkids hospital in downtown toronto as they were better acquitted to handle cases like mine. they started off by wanting to get everything straight with what they knew about my condition. they had me get an mri done because, although ultrasounds are more inexpensive, they are not as clear and detailed as an mri. i also had an ear exam, x-rays of my spine, and another pelvic ultrasound (to check kidneys). doctors aren't allowed to disclose patient information and of course, the poor lady spent a good while looking for my uterus and even called in another technician to help. i ended up asking them if they were trying to look for my uterus, because i didn't have one. the look on their face was hilarious as i'm sure they probably never heard of my condition either. after i met up with my doctor, and everything was figured out, i was properly informed that i did not have any issues with my spine, or kidneys, or ears, but i was missing a uterus, cervix, vaginal canal, and fallopian tubes. i was called in for another appointment after a couple weeks and they did a physical examination where they wanted to measure the depth of my vagina. they had me lay down with my legs in the stirrups, and they took a q-tip covered in a lubricant gel and inserted it in my vagina. the depth of it was about 3mm deep. it was actually quite painful, and i hated doctors by this point anyways.

# family situation:

my parents are pretty religious, and discussions about topics about the female body, menstruation, and private matters like that are highly taboo. everyone knows about it, but no one talks about it. my mother isn't educated and she doesn't know english well so most of the time when i went to the doctors, i went with my dad. it was very weird and awkward. the few times my dad refused to go with me, i went with my mom and had to translate everything the doctor were saying for her.

after my last appointment with sickkids hospital, they referred me to a social worker who gave me her business card, some brochures and other things with information about my condition. my dad took those from me and threw them out, saying i didn't need them. they also asked if i would like to attend the support group meetings, they had weekly at the hospital to which my dad also insisted that i didn't it. going to therapy at the hospital in secret isn't an option because its too far. i can't drive on the highway yet, and it would be impossible for me to make up some lie to go. taking the bus there would take over 2 hours, which i don't particularly mind doing if it helps me, but i don't have time due to school. i actually got a letter from the hospital in september about a pretty cool mrkh conference here where different doctors came with information and everyone dealing with it was invited. i really really wanted to go. but again, it was far. i figured since it was a once in a lifetime opportunity, i could definitely bus there. the event started at 8am and bussing literally took 5 hours. it was unrealistic for me to go. so then i told my parents about it and they said ""you don't want to go to that. they'll put all sorts of rubbish in your mind and how you're not really a woman."" i tried arguing that it was exactly the opposite of that, and that they want to inform you that you are women despite the lack of certain organs. they responded by taking away the letter (which had a website address on it) i had received from the hospital and throwing it away.

i had someone telling me that i need to stand up to my parents. my parents aren't the issue, but my dad is. unfortunately, due to the circumstances that i don't particularly want to reveal online, standing up to him jeopardizes everything for my mother and my younger siblings which is something i refuse to do. i am well aware of the shitty situation i am in. i know they are being abusive, in more than one way. i've thought long and hard about it, and i've come to the terms that not doing anything about it is the best approach. i'm not saying this out of fear, or wanting to be selfish and pretending like we're like a normal family. i've seriously taken everyone's well-being and the future of my younger siblings into consideration, and unfortunately, this is the best option for now.

# surgery:

i had a lot of people asking or informing me about surgery. in my first post, somewhere in the comments, i believe i said something along the lines of ""im a broke college student, and surgery isnt an option right now"", as a way to avoid talking about the real reason why i can't get surgery yet. lucky for me, i live in canada and i have health insurance! surgery is definitely an option for me. but due to my family situation, they believe that i wont need surgery until after i get married because i mean its not like i'm going to be having sex any time soon..haha.

# additional comments:

1. a lot of people, mainly guys, are saying that i could look into doing anal. it's all about personal preference, and i hate it. its not sexy, its not fun, its literally feeling like reverse pooing and its not a good feeling.
2. i can look into the asexual community, but i am not asexual. i may not be able to satisfy my needs, but i do have a pretty high sex drive, and i do enjoy giving and other sexual activities. i don't know if i would want to be in a relationship with an individual who does not want that.
3. a lot of people had a lot to say about how i handled the situation. some saying i did the right thing, and others saying i did it too soon. honestly, i haven't figured out the right way to go about it. i have experimented with telling on first date, telling after a couple dates, telling before we even meet up, and none of them have gone well at all. i once told a guy about my condition before we met up, and the first thing he said to me when he saw me was ""aren't you surprised i still agreed to meet up with you after what you told me?"" i was so taken aback by it, i didn't even know how to respond to such an insensitive and arrogant comment. someone said that ""if a dude has irritable bowel syndrome, i'm sure its an important part of their life but it's a huge first date turn off. so he shouldn't disclose it on the first date"". true, but its not like them fucking is going to be affected by his ibs. i didn't disclose it because it was an important aspect of my life but because it was relevant to what was happening. i evaluated the situation i was in with kyle and noticed that he was trying to get to the next level, so i had to tell him. agree or not, first date material or not, i'm going to stand by with what i did because in that moment it was the right thing to do.
4. i am not going to disclose this on my dating profile. its easy for everyone to sit there and suggest i do that, but you don't really know what its like until you're actually in the situation yourself. i don't want to publicly display it to guys i'm not interested in, nor to those who aren't interested in me. i know guys who also use those dating apps, and i don't want them to stumble across my profile and find out about it.
5. the guy i ended up calling on tuesday night, after i left kyle's apartment, he knows about my condition. he has told me that it wouldn't bother him. i had a lot of messages telling me that i shouldn't friend-zone him, and that i should give him a chance. here is the real reason why i'm not attracted him nor why i would never ever give him a chance: he's basically doing nothing with his life. he's 24, lives with his mom, doesn't work, can't drive, plays video games all day, uses his depression and anxiety as an excuse from putting in any effort towards having an independent life. whereas i on the other hand, i work part-time, i study my ass off in school, and i make time to do extra curricular stuff. i also deal with depression, self harm, and suicidal thoughts. but i treat each day as an opportunity to make progress. i'm not saying i'm better than him because our circumstances are very different nor am i saying that he's not trying his best because everyone deals with things differently. i'm just saying he doesn't have his shit figured out yet and i'm not into that. in addition to this, he was once involved in a situation where he was **""the other guy""**. he was involved with a girl who had a boyfriend and he knew this before getting involved with her but continued with it anyways because ""he was lonely"". i was on the opposite end of that kind of situation, and even though he might not be aware of the magnitude of his actions, i am. there is no way i am dating someone who selfishly puts their needs first and is able to convince themselves that cheating is somehow okay.
6. i think one of the main reasons i even turned to reddit in the first place was because i am clearly looking for some sort of support because therapy isn't an option for me. social media platforms for support do exist, but my parents have me added or followed on those, and i don't want them finding out. there was user who commented on my previous post, saying that he worked with internet security and that he could help me out but for the life of me i can't find his comment anymore amongst all the other notifications i got.

this is far longer than it needed to be, sorry. i hope i answered some questions. i really do appreciate all the support i got. thank you, and take care everyone <3

edit: i'm only doing this to feel better about myself: kyle replied. ""i definitely do not want to get involved"". fuck you, kyle. if y'all wanna hate on him, feel free to. i welcome it with open arms. 

edit: i think i forgot to address this earlier. for those of you asking whether i can orgasm through clitoral stimulation, the answer is no. my clitoris is underdeveloped. stimulation feels good, but it's not enough to reach orgasm. maybe a stronger vibrator or something like that would work? i don't know. i haven't tried. 

edit: guys. i. can. still. pee. i have a urethra. you do not put a guys pee-pee in the same place you pee from. simply anatomy. ",7

"by sending my husband to korea. my husband got invited to be a speaker in a conference, but it'll be in seoul. he didn't feel like attending since he finds conferences annoying & hates long flights. but i wanted to go to korea, and with hotel rooms and his flight paid for, it'll be a cheaper trip for me. 

loads of whining and food bribes later, he accepted with the condition that i go to every event with him to keep him company. 

...and then i realised the conference was happening too soon for me to get a visa. i'm indonesian, and indonesia's not only a 3rd world country, it's the world's largest muslim country....which means i'm always fucked traveling-wise and need a month to apply for visas to travel to most places. 

so yeah. my husband is now on a flight to korea, alone and miserable.

"m (20) my girlfriend is going blind. i'm 20 years old. and i've been with my girlfriend with one year. she's extremely unique and amazing, i love her more than anything. but she's losing her vision, she had a cataract removed when she was 6 years old and among many other extremely rare medical cases she has, and all the other terrible people she's been in relationships with, makes me extremely in love twitch her(sorry to be cheesy), she has 50% of her vision in her left eye but her right eye is 20/20. she's lost her peripherals so bad she can't see me when she's 45 degrees facing me. she's losing her green and blue in her eyes and she's also on a list for a service dog. her and i are very stressed about her most likely going blind within 3 years. we've had the talk about how her previous partners have left her because of her health problems (even though she's a literal walking fucking miracle, i can explain more if anybody's curious) but i'm so in love that i don't want to give up on her even if she goes blind one day. i've never given up easy in relationships and never will. but i'm just looking for advice to give her as she's very stressed about most likely going blind, cheers.",7
"for thinking of moving home because of a noise that was making me crazy. a few months ago i was lying in bed about to fall asleep, when i start to hear a noise that seems to come from upstairs.

the noise was like a bouncing ball falling. the ball began to fall from very high and the noise intensified as it began to approach the ground. then stop. and would come back again.

the sound was soft but very close.

i am someone who sleeps anywhere, anytime, in any position. i'm like chuck norris falling asleep but this was crazy. a sleep deprivation torture.

the sound continued for another 30 minutes and stopped. there were days when it kept going for an hour straight. days when nothing just happened. sometimes i heard it during the day which was almost equally horrible because i couldn't concentrate if i was reading or watching a movie. but he appeared mostly at bedtime.

this went on for over a month.

one night i was very tired and decided to go to bed early (9pm).

and of course there was that motherfucker again.

i did not think. i got out of bed, opened the apartment door and climbed the stairs to my upstairs neighbors.

so there i was. no bra. wearing a t-shirt with prehistoric spots. some pants with three sizes over mine. and with the classic trousers inside the socks for extra heat. with hair where any bird would proudly wear as a nest. and of course knee socks of different colors and sizes because everyone has a black hole sucking socks inside the washing machine. at this point in my decaying life, i didn't even bother to put my shoes on.

so there i was, climbing the stairs with nothing planned to say.

as i approached the door i could hear a lot of noise in their house. i ring the bell and a girl opens the door. everyone in that house came to see what was going on. they were all very well dressed, as if they had come from a wedding or something and visibly lightly drunk.

so there i was in the hallway explaining to a group of fancy drunk people that there is a noise ""like a falling bouncing ball"" coming from that apartment.

she tells me she has housemates but the room above mine is empty.

i still say that it is impossible. that the noise comes almost every day and it's been a month and i'm starting to go crazy.

she says she doesn't know where the noise might come from. there is nothing at home that can make a sound that i tried to mimic.

yes, i imitated a bouncy ball with different voices for a group of fancy drunk people.

so there i was, thinking as we talked that none of this was going to get resolved and most likely would have to move house until i say, without much thought, ""wanna go see it?""

so there we were, me and 8 other fancy drunk people in my small room quietly waiting for the noise to appear.

and of course, nothing happened.

i apologized to everyone, i took the fancy drunk people to the door and went to bed to spoon with my shame and retardness.

this was last week.

today a friend came here for the afternoon. while we were talking the wild noise appeared. i was hysterical.

""are you hearing this""

""yea...""

""i can no longer with this noise, i think i'll have to move house.""

""it comes from your warmer ...""

so my heater has two buttons. one to turn it on and one to change the temperature. and it seems that when the heater is off and the temperature button is in heat mode, it makes a weird noise that looks like a bouncing ball and the echo of the house sounds like it comes from upstairs.

tl;dr: i'm retarded.",4
"wife died unexpectedly, discovered her affair. my wife died this past week unexpectedly. she was young and healthy, and the illness took her in hours. i thought things had hit rock bottom. she essentially died in front of me, and i was wracked by grief and guilt over her death. 

all things considered, i was coping as well as could be expected. make no mistake, i was going through the expected grieving reactions. i raged and hysterically cried for days. i went numb and then silent, then hysterical again. but i have good friends and i have been surrounded by family from both sides of the marriage. 

in the process of going through her belongings i discovered on her phone that she had been having an on and off affair for the last three years. it looks like she started cheating during a period where i was depressed after losing my job and father in the space of two weeks, both unexpectedly. after mourning for three months and seeking treatment for diagnosed depression, i was back at a new job. however, at the time she said that she felt lonely and that i was distant to her. in the following years we worked to try and mend our relationship but she would always come back to saying that things changed those months after my father's death. 

what more can life do to me? this man she was having the affair with appears to be an asshole that may have been abusing her, based on the text messages. he appears to be the exact opposite of me. i am a kind, generous, attractive, and intelligent person with a good career. the logical part of my brain knew that she had the capacity for dishonesty and selfishness, but i could never have imagined this. 

i am absolutely and totally devastated. the only saving grace is that we never had children. i wanted them and she did too, but she kept wanting to put it off. i suppose now i know the truth of why. 

i feel like i will never be happy again. ",7
"farmers are by far the most important job in existence, yet they go under-appreciated, are denounced as 'ruffians' and intellectually challenged by the rest of society.. the typical perception of a 'farmer' is missing half his teeth, speaking in an accent that only the local town will understand, calling everyone a 'city' boy or lad, avoiding school because of 'hard work' and so forth.

everyone looks at them like they are some sort of underclass filth while everyone else is 'better'.

when is the last time you heard someone ask that they wanted to be a farmer? outside country areas, never. wanting to be a farmer is seen as beyond a man of your talents(https://youtu.be/stq_ikiwxwy?t=12) and is generally frowned upon by the rest of society despite the *doing the most important job to the survival of mankind.*

"update: for getting upset with my girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period?. link to the original: https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/aja1al/aita_for_getting_upset_with_my_girlfriend_because/

so the general consensus was that i was being a raging asshole, though a few thought i was just ignorant. it's been a while since i made that post, and my own conclusion is that i am probably both.

i've done a lot of thinking about my behavior that week and i've realized a lot of things. this isn't something that i wrote in my original post because it was off topic and sounded like i was just making excuses for myself, but my dad had passed away earlier that week and i had been in a terrible mood. i wasn't acting like myself at all. instead of coping in a healthy way, i'd been looking to my girlfriend for a pick-me-up and unfairly blaming her when she failed to deliver (for a reason completely out of her control).

the date wasn't really for her, it was for me, and that's what i'd been trying to avoid thinking about. i was behaving very selfishly and trying to convince myself that i was just upset because this problem had happened before. the truth was, her period getting in the way of dates had never really bothered me before this time around. i was just looking for reasons to justify my own anger.

that was extremely immature of me, to say the least.

i apologized to my girlfriend and, because she's an angel, she accepted the apology. because of the comments suggesting she may have a medical problem i asked her if she had pcos or endometris, and surprisingly enough, she said that she had never been examined for either.

we went to have her examined and it turns out that she has pcos, which essentially means she has cysts in her ovaries, which explains the irregular periods and extreme pain during them. so yeah, i felt horribly guilty about blaming her for that. luckily she has not seen some of the other symptoms of it (weight gain and hair growth) but she is pretty worried that they will appear. she'll be getting regular treatment from now on so i'm hopeful that she will see some relief soon.

tldr; i was being an ass because of my bad mood and it turns out my girlfriend has pcos. thankfully she forgave me and we are back to our normal, loving selves. thanks for the help, reddit.",3

"i sleep on a stolen mattress every night. (apparently i need at least fifty characters in the title so i just put this here). i go to college in california, and it's pretty expensive here, like most of the u.s. my tuition is $20,000 a year, and that's without housing and food. so, when you go to school here, you expect to get your money's worth considering the cost. i came in as a transfer last year, and signed up to live in the transfer housing community, which was a set of nice apartments on campus dedicated to transfers. well, what happened last year was the school accepted too many students, mainly freshmen, so they placed as many freshmen as they could in dorms, and then put the rest of them in the transfer community housing. that created an issue for some of the transfer students, such as myself, as the school had nowhere to put them. we got placed in ""temporary housing,"" which was condemned housing in an unsafe area across the freeway from the school. it was due to be torn down in march, so the school was trying to place people in housing asap. these apartments were only 625 square feet with four people in each one, and were super run down. the school didn't give us a discount or anything while i was living there, and charged us the same amount that they would have if we had been living in the nice apartments they promised us. it was ridiculous, and 1300 a month for this place, per person. so 5600 a month total, which is insane even for california. basically, the school started putting the left-over transfers wherever they could. some got placed in freshmen dorms, and i was not about to live in a dorm again, especially after being promised something better. the school still didn't have enough space, and they offered students a bribe to cancel their housing contracts and find somewhere else to live. i found a girl who was in the same situation and we found a place together and took the school's money, which was a pretty good amount, although not as much as they should have offered to be honest. so, her apartment was fully furnished, because the people who lived there before left all their furniture and everything. most apartments were barely furnished at all and filled with furniture that the school rented. so my friend's apartment had all this nice furniture from ikea, including a table, couch, five paintings, a really nice small cabinet, a coffee table, and a side table. also, the people in the apartment across from her moved out and didn't lock the door, so there was that place too. we took almost everything from her apartment, including four chairs from the apartment across from hers. we were able to furnish our entire new apartment that we got together and used the paintings to decorate. we also took two desk chairs from my apartment and two mattresses. the school never said anything. my dad even helped us. he brought down the suv and we went back and forth from the old apartments to our new one. so yeah basically my first bonding experience with my roommate was looting an apartment. we found some housemates and stuff too, and they got lucky because they didn't have to provide any furniture. we probably got over $1200 worth of furniture from those apartments. we didn't take the couch though, as there was no space, but we now live in a very nice apartment right across the street from where our old apartments used to be. they've been demolished now. before they did that we saw moving trucks going over there and people loading all the furniture the school rented onto them, but no one ever contacted us about what we took. the desk chairs and mattresses belonged to the school, but we took them anyways. so yeah, that's why i sleep on a stolen mattress every night. considering how much we get ripped off as students, it really was worth it, no regrets.",11
"start thinking of ""saving money"" as ""making money"" instead.. i'm no expert, but this simple change in thought has saved me more money over the past year than ever before.

i was constantly thinking of ways to make more money in life, and would do anything it took to create multiple incomes.

i was saving, but not really actively focused on it.

i would just save what i planned to, and spend my budget as freely as possible.

i then had a thought that if i actively tried to save and make better decisions under my budget, it would be like making money.

i guess what it boils down to is this -

just because you have a budget, doesn't mean you need to spend all of it.

i know that's a fundamental idea, but i never realized how just changing my thought process would make it that much more enjoyable to save.

now i look at money saved as money made.

didn't buy lunch and ate at home? i just made $15.

didn't buy the more expensive brand and went with the generic version? i just made $7.

went to the movies on discount night and didn't get snacks? i just made $20.

constantly doing this has increased my savings dramatically, and its actually a fun concept to keep me motivated.",10
"update: i (48 m) don't know how to be a dad to a child (1 year m) i never wanted.. while it's only been a few days since i posted i think i've been able to find myself in a better place, mentally speaking. i've done a vast amount of thinking and introspection. i had a lot to process. a lot to figure out. i believe i was in a bit of a panic when i posted. i feel calmer now since reading each and every comment.

i know now more than ever that i was never meant to be a dad. i certainly never wanted to be dad. yet here i am, a dad. that will never change. my son is here and he needs me more than i need the life i'd originally planned for myself. he needs me.

admittedly i've been a very hands off father. not truly involved nor invested. if anything i was peeking through the window of fatherhood. or better put, having one foot in the door and the other out. neither here nor there. mostly watching from afar.

i think my fear of him and what he represented in my mind drove me away from him. it made me avoid him so i could avoid the overwhelming feeling of ""what have i done"" and ""my life is over."" i think avoidance made things fester, made my fear and dread grow, and that painted a dark cloud over everything.

still, i feel heavy weight of loathing for the future and i mourn for the life i wanted, even if it is selfish. i realize these feelings they need to go. i need to move on. grieve in a sense and push forward and forget how things could have been. they simply are not and will never be.

i sent my wife away yesterday so i could spend the day with my son. my first day alone with him. maybe that's pathetic. maybe i'm a terrible man. maybe i'm a terrible husband. definitely an awful dad.

i wanted to experience him in a way i hadn't before. alone without being able to hand him over when he frustrated me or i was bored. 

honestly the day went shit. we both had a tough time. he wanted mom and so did i. there was this moment though when i sang to him ""i like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas"" and he laughed so damn hard. i've never made him laugh like that before. it wasn't miraculous or revolutionary but i did feel this little spark inside me. this little ""i want to do that again"" sort of feeling.

i've done what a lot of you have told me and i've reached out to a few therapists. i have an appointment for next week and currently waiting to hear back from two others. i want to shop around and find a good fit since i know i need this. i feel ashamed admitting such a thing. i feel embarrassed. i for some reason even feel emasculated too. 

there are also a lot of unpleasant things i feel when i look at my son. what i've utterly failed to take into account is what i see, which is the epitome of innocence. from that i learned that i need to seperate my feelings from him. whatever negativity i feel is not his doing, that is all me and my fears surrounding him. he is not the source of my feelings. he is a trigger and i need to fix that.

my son is innocent and he needs me. this is the truth.

i'm not leaving. i've resolutely decided that i'm not leaving. i'm never leaving. i need to pack up that fantasy and put it out of my mind. my wife needs me. my son needs me more. he needs me. he needs me. he needs me. i keep telling myself this. he needs me. he needs a dad. i have to be all in because in the long run being all out seems like such a worse fate for all involved.

i want to touch on a few things before i wrap this up...

saying i love my wife is a profound understatement. she is all my hopes and dreams rolled into a package of femininity and determination. i married her for the long haul not just until things didn't go my way. nowhere in my vows did it say if we accidentally create a child everything we've gone through is null and void, my love will disappear and i'm out. 

some people said she betrayed me. i've never felt betrayed. the baby wasn't planned. we even took steps to terminate but her heart said no and i respect that. i respect her and i respect her choice. she made the decision she could live with.  unless you or your spouse has been pregnant and you've considered all your options your opinion really isn't relevant. watching my wife go through the rollercoaster of emotions and hormones while battling with not only her desires but mine... it wasn't an easy decision for her. she didn't just suddenly decide she wanted a baby. she agonized over the decision.

the child is mine. some called that into question. he is mine. there are personal factors that i don't want to get into, but i know without a doubt he is mine. and, yes, i have since gotten a vasectomy. i'd attempted twice in the past and was denied. they were hesitant because i was young and childless, then it was because my wife was still young and we were childless. maybe i could have better searched for doctors but in the end we chose to go with an iud.

as to where to go from here? well, i'm a dad now. i have been for a year. there's no changing that. i must learn how to be a good one. my son needs me. i've ordered some parenting books for fathers. i've been researching some groups to join for fathers as well. i've also been contemplating cutting my hours at work. i typically work 10-12 hour days. i don't think that's feasible anymore. i'm a dad now and my son needs me.

he needs me.

"(update!!) deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.. amidst the hate and questioning of my sexuality, there was actually some fantastic advice in the original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c5toeo/tifu_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my_new/). i came into the office today with a pretty clear idea of what i was going to say. i felt okay with myself, but holy shit the closer i got, the more fucking petrified i became. the walk from the front door to the edit bay was a total blur, i felt like i was going to have a heart attack. i kept going back in my head whether or not it was better if she was already in the office or if i was in there first, and maybe if i was first it would seem more intimidating. my mind was going nuts. i got back to the edit bay and peaked in and she was already there, and turned around and saw me kind of creeping in. just a fucking horrible way to start this.

&#x200b;

then, i proceeded to absolutely butcher my eloquently preplanned speech. i honestly wish i could tell you all exactly what i said but i really don't remember. i know i apologized, i said something along the lines of each of us probably don't want to ever have to look at each other again, and i did say that if she felt uncomfortable being here, i'd be happy to help her find another job. she asked if i wanted her to leave and i said of course not.

&#x200b;

she was kind of looking down the whole time and after i finished my word vomit, she just kind of shook her head and said ""what are the fucking odds."" we both started laughing and i came a bit more back to reality and asked again if she was comfortable working together and she said she was. we agreed it might take a while to actually look at each other but luckily our desks have us back to back, ugh.

&#x200b;

i got coffee and came back and she had music on and we kind of worked for a few without speaking but the mood was definitely lighter. then she asked if she could ask me a few questions. ohhh boy, lol, but sure.

* when did i learn i could do this?
* have i ever done this for a crowd before?

and of course...

* does it feel like sucking dick or getting your dick sucked?

and..

* are you bi? do you think it's kind of gay?

&#x200b;

i obliged, i think being back to back helped us talk it out and kind of laugh about it.

&#x200b;

i asked her how long she has known my friend for. (they met in college). she said that she has always been a bit crazy and a bit of a freak. she said when she told her that this guy she was dating could suck his own dick, she was not at all surprised. i got the feeling this wasn't the first bizarre scenario she had gotten her in.

&#x200b;

i really wanted to ask her if she enjoyed herself but i was worried it was teetering on sexual harassment and honestly working in such close quarters i don't think i want to know the answer.

&#x200b;

so there you have it.

&#x200b;

oh and no, i do not know if she's on reddit. i felt like asking would have drawn attention to it, but there was no mention of my post or anything like that.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i did my best, she did hers, it's awkward but it'll all be okay.

&#x200b;

edit:  okay, i'll answer the questions.

i learned with my girlfriend in college.  we were very experimental, and somehow it led to this.  it's been a party trick of mine, lol, since.

&#x200b;

never done it for a crowd before, no.

&#x200b;

(from the original post)

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts. no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before. pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex. it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward. by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

&#x200b;

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement. a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off. kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc. i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice. but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful. better than jerking off that's for sure.

&#x200b;

edit 2:  guys, ""party trick"" is just a saying.   this is the only party i have ever done this.

&#x200b;

edit 3:  no, there are no videos or photos.  but if you live in la i might give you a private show if you can somehow make my life more awkward.",4
"i anonymously called my boss in the middle of the night for almost a year.. i guess with age i feel a little bit bad about this now. 

where i used to work i was on 3rd shift as a salaried supervisor. when i was off work and trying to sleep or relax i was constantly getting work related calls and texts from the other shifts including my boss. i was carrying the whole department basically. 

i loved what i did but i didn't feel i was getting paid nearly enough so after a year or so i started getting sick of never really being off work. 

my boss had a company paid cell phone and as a manager he was required to keep it on at all times in case there was en emergency at work.

during this time i had an old prepaid phone that was still active with carryover minutes. one night when we were slow at work i used *67, which blocks your number from being displayed, to call his phone and wake him up at 3:00 am. when he sleepily said hello i hung up. i planned on it being a one time thing but when he came in the next morning he was red eyed and exhausted like i was all the time from being called when off work. 

from that point on i would call him in the middle of the night two or three times per week. most of the time i would let it ring three or four times and hang up. sometimes i would call him from my real phone and pretend i ""butt dialed"" him. on the days i would call him when he was sleeping he would drag in looking rough and i would take secret pleasure in seeing him feel like i did since i was still constantly being called when i was off. 

occasionally he would comment that some ""damn asshole"" called his phone and woke him up. after about a year they hired another supervisor so my work was cut in half. i finally got some time to relax and get some rest. i stopped calling him at that point after almost a year. 

sometimes i'm torn between feeling bad about doing it and also that maybe i should have done it more.

"for being mad at my wife for dumpster diving?. hi everyone, i'd like some input. 

my wife and i struggle to make ends meet. we strictly budget everything down to the dollar, without a lot of wiggle room. this includes our groceries, which we have a set $ amount we spend, no more. 

recently our dd dropped the milk and spilled it. it was 5 days to payday and we'd already done our grocery shopping. my wife said she'd figure it out. i know she has a little money stashed for herself that she's gotten from selling some of her clothes recently, so when she came home with milk and a bag of chips for the kids as a treat, i figured she must have decided to dip into that. boy was i wrong. 

the next week i noticed our food was a little...higher quality. a couple of brand name things, even a roast on sunday with asparagus. i figured she must have gotten some killer deals, but when i asked she said ""oh no, i found a bunch of money off coupons."" then she showed a few to me. 

they were those ""earn 0.07$ a gallon"" receipts you get at the gas station. she had gone there and dug through the garbage! she said she got about 5$ worth of these receipts the first time when we needed milk, and went back the next week for more, netting about 30$ total. 

i was speechless. i asked her how she could lower herself like that. she replied that she did it for our kids. when i asked why she didn't use her money she had saved, she said it was hers and she was saving it for something special. 

i'm so disgusted guys. i can't believe she did this. i don't even want to look at her. she on the other hand is mad at me, and says i'm an asshole for being mad, and for expecting her to use her saved money instead. for expecting my wife not to dumpster dive?

edit: ok! i am definitely the asshole. after reading all of your comments, i really thought about it. i talked to my wife, and told her i was sorry for the way i acted. she is annoyed but willing to forgive me. i was actually mad at myself. the reason we are struggling is because i was in an accident a few months ago. i slid through a stop light on an icy road. it has permanently affected my ability to work in the trade i've worked in for 15 years. i'm on disability through my employer but it isn't even half of what i used to make. we are getting by, but it is tight. and i don't know what we are going to do when it runs out. my wife is stretching every dollar (she takes care of the finances). i guess i was just mad at myself because i can't take care of my family anymore, and lashed out. i'm going to give her a foot rub tonight. thanks for the honesty guys.

"reporters are harassing us after a friend's tragic accident and posting inappropriate photos and quotes. what are our rights?. i have a friend who was badly injured in a tragic accident. somehow, the media was on the scene and took photos, splashing them over several outlets with a sensationalized title. they had been constantly harassing me, my family, her family, her friends, her coworkers, and her neighbors by calling daily. they camped out at the hospital grounds and followed us around, and some even snuck upstairs using our names, which is definitely illegal. we called the police and hospital security multiple times but by the time they got there, the reporters ran off.

it has been such a hard time for her and everyone close to her. the last thing we need is to be followed and harassed. finally, after the 5th call, i asked the reporters to find it in their hearts to take down the photos of my friend that were partially exposing her private parts and injuries, so she can maintain her dignity. i also politely, but sternly, asked them to please stop calling everyone as we were still processing what happened. 

of course, these ""reporters"" are the actual scum of the earth, devoid of a soul. the one i spoke with said they would remove the photos and stop calling. they did neither. the photos are still up months later and they called for another 2 days. i told them that i did not want anything i said to be published and that i am an anonymous friend. instead, they made up quotes, saying that i said she was healing well when she was not. 

even though i never game them my full name, they already had it and plastered it all over the article, including under a photo of her with another made-up quote. after it was published, i got 50+ calls and messages from acquaintances berating me for sending photos to the media, when i did no such thing. i was nowhere near the accident. that took another few days to clear up but i felt that was slanderous and purposefully misleading.

this happened in nys. i have a very low opinion of reporters at the moment. they made my life and my friends' lives so much more difficult in an already difficult time, just to sell a sensationalized story. do i have legal grounds to sue them for (1) harassing us (we have 2 official police reports with witnesses), (2) publishing nude photos without consent, and (3) misquoting under my full name without my permission?

*edit to the 1st paragraph to make it more vague, as some have been able to deduce the story, which goes to show how widespread it was. also, please do not pm requesting the full story. the point of my post was to figure out what to do with reporters that were harassing us. isn't it ironic if you're doing the same?

"my(24f) coworker(50f) blamed me for my miscarriage (update). it's been a long day. first, i want to again thank everyone for their love, support, and advice. i wasn't able to answer everyone but know i tried to read all of them. thank you.


so, this morning ended up being a meeting with my boss. now, yesterday i was given a run down of how she made a complaint of interrupting her work day and not being told important information. she did have an 'example' but it was very stupid one.


co-worker when she was at my desk had apparently been staring at my screen. she saw that the usual application to log data we use wasn't up and went straight to assuming i wasn't working. what she didn't know is me and two other senior employees were using a new application that we will be switching over to and was running on that application (with the old one minimized) she then came back to ask about lunch and saw 'i still didn't have the application up' and went running to boss to tell him i wasn't on the application and i wasn't working, making it hard for her as she had to pick up the slack. 


my boss calmly assured her that i was working on a different application and all productivity is monitored (i get my shit done) she then, not wanting to be wrong i guess, doubled down and was upset i hadn't communicated that to her. i didn't even know. my boss asked her to elaborate on that and she brought up the application again and i guess they talked in circles for a bit. he let her know that he takes these matters seriously and asked her for any examples of me not communicating. she had nothing. 


when i spoke to my boss, at this point i was upset. i finally just told him what happened and explained what happened yesterday. he was not pleased. he did let me know i don't have to explain myself and that next time if i'm in that situation to go straight to him. he offered his condolences for my loss.


as for her, she is no longer allowed to speak to me. anything work related must be done through the messenger we have or email. though, he assured me that as we are working on different applications, she shouldn't be reaching out to me. she has a laundry list of people to ask before me. he told me to document everything. anything she does say document it for the time being and be as curt as possible.


today, she hasn't been around me. she even moved her monitor and keyboard so she's facing away from me. she hasn't said a word all day. it's been a wave of relief for me.


tldr: coworker tried to report me for something stupid, it didn't work. she is now not allowed to speak to me.

"ex fails drug test giving birth to her baby and now dss wants to do a home visit with me.. so the backstory goes like this: 

ex and i had a son together. she decided one day to split and go live the party life. i take our son and move on and meet and marry my now wife. wife and i buy a house and have a new baby ourselves. ex meets someone and they become meth heads together. at that point i sought custody of our son and won. our custody arrangement states that i have primary care and she is to only see him every other weekend supervised at/by her parents. which for a long time she rarely, if at all showed up. ex and new boyfriend have extremely volatile and abusive relationship, she gets pregnant and new boyfriend leaves. ex appears to have gotten it together enough now that she's pregnant. or so it appeared.

on to the issue. 

ex gives birth to new baby. i get a phone call that day from dss saying that they'd like to come do a home visit to check on my son because she failed a drug test (for marijuana) when she gave birth. this was not the first instance during the pregnancy that dss was involved. from my understanding, she failed for the same reason early in the pregnancy so i guess dss kept her on their radar. so dss calls me explains what's happening and even asks if i'd be willing to do a drug test as well.

i have and want as little as possible to do with my ex. as i stated, i moved on and feel i'm doing well for me and my family. she is the unfortunate consequence for my young naivety. i do not regret having my son i just wish she wasn't his mother. 

so because of her actions and choices, i'm being dragged in by proxy. 

my job is very laborious and in the interest of full transparency, i myself (responsibly) smoke weed at night before bed. 

so what are my options as far as what dss is asking of me? do i consent to everything? do i seek legal representation? what happens if i take the drug test and fail? will i lose my kids? 

this is really the most stressful situation for me and my wife who have nothing to do with her and her problems except the fact she's my sons mother

"for expecting a guy who invites me to his house for a movie date at dinner time to offer drinks or food?. the setup: i've known this guy for a couple years and we've worked together occasionally. we've had a couple dates before. we split the bill without any discussion or issue. 

he snapchats me one day to come over to his place that night and watch a movie he has. i say sure.

i forget the rest of the snapchats, but at some point i replied ""pizza and a movie"" and he replied ""yeah see you soon!"" it was just an innocent phrase but i didn't eat that day and assumed we'd get food together.

i show up and he has the movie. i say ""so are we getting food?"" 

he says ""i already ate. but i'm sure you have apps on your phone if you want something."" then he leaves to go to the bathroom.

i sit there awkwardly. this guy previously talked about being a men's rights guy. a normal one, not an incel dickhead. he also mentioned he's low on cash. but isn't it just good manners to offer guests in your house food or some shit? if he was too broke i'd obviously be happy to get him something, but that wasn't the vibe i got since he bragged about a new game he bought. 

he returns and turns on the tv and turns off all the lights. then he goes into the kitchen, which i assume is to get alcohol. 

i call out casually ""what do you got to drink?"" 

he calls back ""do you like tap water?""

this is not some red pill bullshit. i know this guy, he's serious. there's nothing in his fridge but muscle milk, water, and kale. 

i call out, ""yeah, sure.""

he brings me back a glass of tap water. he winks at me.

i'm starving. i haven't eaten since 8am. 

i say ""hey, i don't wanna be weird, but i thought we were getting pizza."" 

he says in a sympathetic tone, ""oh. i see. you must have been confused. you mentioned the food, not me. i should have cleared that up, i ate earlier. sorry if that wasn't clear. we can still get a pizza if you want. just pick anywhere nearby and order it.""

this is still kind of shitty to me, but i ignore it and order one large pizza. the pizza shows up. i eat two slices of it. the rest of it sits there the entire movie. he doesn't offer to contribute the $6 it would cost to split it. he tries to make out with me during the movie. i stop him and feel too weird to be into it. 

after the movie, i decide it would be better just to talk about it rather than feel bad. i tell him my feelings and how he's weird with money and i'm uncomfortable. he feels bad and gives me $6 right away and thanks me for speaking up. there was no bad intention at all. no red pill, no plan, nothing. just a dude who didn't think my pizza was his responsibility. 

then he asks me to have sex with him.

i decline. knowing we still have to work together, i manage to tiptoe out the door.

i don't expect or need people to buy me things, but i think offering houseguests food when you invite them over at dinner time is a sign of good manners. (and then they can offer to split the tab)

"by having a stress-induced orgasm in a public library.. throwaway account because my dignity.

obligatory this happened during midterms in october. i just haven't had a chance to write about it until now.

this is going to be a long one, but i feel this story requires a certain degree of explanation before reaching the climax (no pun intended).

i'm a 26-year-old woman in a rather intensive graduate program. to put it in perspective, grad programs in this field typically take two years to complete, but the one i'm enrolled in is a one-year program. so right of the bat, i'm completing two years' worth of coursework in one. secondly, i'm now at a fairly prestigious university after having completed my undergrad at a not-so-great university. i always thought i had high standards for myself, but the expectations at this school are *much* higher than what i'm used to, and i still question all the time whether i'm actually good enough to be here. thirdly, i'm not so great at handling stress. i am working with a therapist through campus psychological services, but i'm not finding their approach to therapy particularly helpful. and since that's all i can afford right now with my insurance, that's the best i can get.

bottom line: i'm stressed out all the time. and midterms were *hell*: four hefty papers all due within three days of each other. now, three of those papers weren't so bad. they took a while to write, but at least i knew what i was writing. paper number four, however… guys, this paper fucked me *hard*. this paper fucked me like i've never been fucked in my whole life. and i'm in an english-related field, so believe me, i am *not* used to getting fucked by papers. i won't bore you with the details, but in a nutshell, the paper required that we read a pool of approximately 30-40 journal articles and write a paper on their characteristics. (to be fair, we had from mid-august to mid-october to complete this assignment, so given the timespan, it *was* doable.) now, if i were to write a list of all the reasons why this paper threw me off, i'd end up with a dissertation. in the limited space i have, i can't fully explain why this paper was so hard, so please just believe me when i tell you it was *hard*. yes, even though i'd spoken to the professor about it a few times. and it was worth about a third of my grade.

anyway, this big bastard was due on a monday, so i brought myself to the library on friday, determined (after several failed attempts) to *at least* get an outline done. i tried for about 2.5 hours to draw up a plan to organize this thing, but for the life of me, i *could not* figure out how to cram all the required elements into a cohesive, logical argument, especially given the miniscule word count of the assignment (2,500 words maximum, when this paper *could* have been a fucking book). now, at this point, it's not that i was losing willpower or energy. no: the problem was that i was freaking out. i wanted to focus on this paper, but all my brain could do was assault me with a barrage of negative thoughts: *you're going to fail this paper and fail this class and lose your financial aid and drop out of school and be a huge failure to everyone because you suck…* you get the idea. and then, to make matters worse, my mental distress started to express itself physically; i *wanted* to keep writing, but my hands were shaking so much i could barely even hold my pen. my neck was stiff as a board, my head burned above my eyes, my back was spasming a little, and my heart was pounding like a fucking jackhammer. and then.

and *then*.

i've googled this and haven't really been able to find a satisfactory explanation for what happened next. but i'll recount the sensation as i experienced it. all of a sudden, i felt a *massive* rush of blood to my lower body. i can only guess this was some kind of adrenaline-related/fight-or-flight response. my entire bottom half suddenly felt as if it had been electrified: feet, legs… and lady bits. there i was, silently losing my mind in a library full of students studying for midterms, when out of the clear blue sky, my clit feels ready to burst.

i came before i even knew what was happening. it wasn't some screaming, thrashing affair, but i did convulse in my chair and ended up moaning a little out of sheer surprise. and yes, people *definitely* noticed; i was on the quiet-study floor, so the room had been *silent* up until that point. i don't think i was obvious enough that anyone would conclude i'd just had an orgasm in the library, but still… clearly *something* had happened. i packed my shit, went the hell home, and drank several screwdrivers at 2:00 in the afternoon.

as i said, i haven't really found a thorough explanation for this (though i haven't been searching too intensely). i have found the occasional anecdotal account of people having similar experiences. mostly, though, i've been finding articles about how stress and anxiety *inhibit* orgasm in women. for my part in this research, i state for the record that stress can, indeed, spiral so low that is sort of bursts through the other side and expresses itself as sexual ecstasy, whether you like it or not.

also, i got a 78 on the paper. but my professor assures me it won't end up tanking my grade.

tl;dr: i got so stressed that i came involuntarily in my university library. also, i may have masochistic tendencies and don't know who i am anymore.

edit: thank you all for your thoughtful responses, as well as for the silver and gold.

i'd just like to clarify on a couple of points that have been brought up: i did not procrastinate on this assignment. i completed the reading in a timely manner and gave myself plenty of time (more than a week) to write this paper. given the rigor of this program, that is *all* the time i could give myself to do it. the paper just never quite happened in an orderly, timely fashion because i was so confused and stressed out. normally i never put off things until the last minute. it just sort of happened this time because i had no idea what i was doing.

secondly, i am working with a therapist on my stress management techniques. i recently told my therapist that i'd like to do some more intensive work for managing stress, and she referred me to an off-campus therapist who will accept my insurance. hopefully, we'll be able to work together to figure out some solutions that work for me. again, i'm very grateful for all the advice and input! i'm really glad i could make you guys laugh. you all have made me laugh, as well!",4
"all bodies are not beautiful, healthy bodies are beautiful.. i'd like to preface this by saying that i do appreciate the spirit behind the statement that all bodies are beautiful. i think it's very cool that people want others to feel accepted and comfortable despite being different than a perceived majority. 

however, all bodies are not beautiful, and we shouldn't pretend they are. people that are overweight to the degree it affects their health are not beautiful, they're unhealthy. they don't deserve to be mistreated for it, but they also shouldn't be constantly validated. 

there is a biological standard for objective physical attraction partially rooted in physical health. we are not attracted to people that won't be healthy mates. we are not attracted to people that look unhealthy. we should stop pretending unhealthy bodies are attractive because they aren't. i hate seeing people validate someone's unhealthy lifestyle because they don't want them to feel bad. it's not a good way to help people, it just makes things worse.

edit 1: reading the comments i saw a few people telling me that i was talking about a skinny body and that i should clarify that. that's not quite true. skinny can also be unhealthy and therefore unattractive, but it is true that i am mostly addressing weight when i talk about a healthy body. 

edit 2: i don't think that amputations or scars make a person not beautiful. if your body is healthy, it's beautiful. it's a very cut-and-dry opinion. if you have scars, had an amputation for medical reasons, or anything like that your body can certainly still be beautiful. i only want my post to address things that are in the control of the person.

edit 3: hopefully my final edit. i'm sorry if i have been unclear. i have a lot of comments about how beauty is subjective, so let me clarify: this post refers to an objective standard of physical attraction that is held by having a healthy body and lost by having an unhealthy body. i understand attraction can have a subjective element, that's not where my opinion is based though!",6

after taking a break from smoking for a few months, i decided to break out an indica-hybrid vape cartridge i bought a while ago and let the good times roll. i've been hitting it the past few days, and each time i get higher than a kite because my tolerance is so low now and i don't know when to stop hitting it.

i was on facebook yesterday morning when i was sober, and in one of my meme groups saw a screenshot of a post about a 23-year-old college student who died after eating pasta that had been left out five days. the top comment on it was ""he pasta way,"" and that just stuck with me because it was so funny.

later that night, i was cleaning out my fridge and came across two containers of food i had brought back with me from home (i'm a college senior and the semester started two weeks ago). one of the containers was a tortellini salad, and i noticed it had a ""sell by"" date of four days before. i was about to throw it out, then decided to smell it and try a piece given the proximity of the sell by date. i had one piece of tortellini, decided it might be alright, and put it back to figure it out later.

a few hours later, the high times have come and i'm hitting my vape pen. after watching a rodney dangerfield classic, i go up to bed and am lying there when all of a sudden i start feeling a sense of doom. i start imagining every hypochondriac symptom in the book, from chest pain, to stomach pain, to shortness of breath, etc. 

at the same time, all i could see in my head was ""he pasta way"" and started thinking that i was an almost 23-year-old college senior and i ate pasta that was approximately five days expired. i suddenly realized that i never saw the guy's name or where it happened in the screenshot, and started freaking out thinking it was about me. shortly thereafter the emt side of me takes over, checks that i have a pulse when i've pretty much convinced myself my heart has stopped, and i basically run an out-of-body patient assessment on myself to make sure i'm alive. i fell asleep, and just woke up after 12 hours.

tl;dr got so high i thought i had seen my own death before it happened",4

"allergic child in son's class (nj). my son is in full-day kindergarten, and the kids eat lunch and snack in their classroom (not the cafeteria), because there is a child with severe allergies to multiple foods. i first of all want to say that i am completely fine making accommodations so a child with multiple, severe allergies can go to school. i can't imagine what his family goes through, and how nerve-wracking this is for them. at the same time, all twenty kids in the class are now affected.


- kids are only allowed to bring in pre-packaged foods and beverages so that the teacher can check the ingredients, so i can't pack him a sandwich- everything has to be in a sealed package.


- parents are asked not to serve the children any of the severe allergens for breakfast before coming to school, including peanut butter, eggs and dairy. 


- parents with pets are asked to dress their children right before leaving the house, to reduce pet dander on clothes. the teacher suggested (but it's not required) that kids can get dressed in the garage :/


again, i am happy to comply as best i can, but i am curious at what point accommodations go from reasonable to unreasonable. 



edit: just to clarify, because a lot of people have questions:

- kids wash their hands at the classroom sink as soon as they get to school, and before and after lunch. 

- kids *are* allowed to bring packaged food that contains allergens (other then peanuts), just no liquid milk, yogurt or hard boiled eggs, and no snacks that leave a heavy powder residue like doritos. kids can get food ""delivered"" from the cafeteria, as long as it's not the above mentioned food. 

- there are only two classes per grade, so switching classes is not a sustainable option. 


my kid is doing okay for now, thanks to his love of pita and hummus, which comes in a prepackaged snack cup. however if next week he decides he doesn't like hummus, or if he is being too messy with the hummus (the kid with allergies is allergic to sesame, which is in hummus apparently) we'll be in a jam- no pun intended, i think actual jam is okay.",2
"how i've gamified saving my money and why it's worked better than anything i've tried before.. i'm a tipped employee who takes home my main source of income on a daily basis, which can make it hard to budget correctly. it's easy to spend money when you constantly have a little cash in your wallet. recently, i decided to crack down, and actually came up with a system that has worked spectacularly. i have very minimal expenses and make a decent living, but i'm still shocked and proud of myself that i managed to save nearly $1500 in less than a month following this method. this plan might not work as well for those who take home a bi-weekly paycheck, but as someone who has lived off tips for over 10 years, it has worked amazingly. i think of it as a mashup as the envelope formula and gamifying your money.

i set a goal of putting away $55 every day from my tips, even on days i don't work. i set up an excel chart to track this.(http://imgur.com/lajglxd) i used a basic knowledge of the program to set up formulas tracking my goal, the actual amount saved, and how ""on track,"" i was based off how much money i decided to save for the day. 

the part that really gamified it for me was color coding the 'on track' column to either show red or green based on whether or not i was on par for my goal.  it actually became fun to know how much money i needed to put away every day to see the little box turn green, and even more fun to know when i was well over my goal. for some reason, this color coded excel chart helped me save money quicker than anything i've ever tried before, and i'm looking forward to continue using this method and seeing how much i can potentially save.

edit: since so many people have been asking, i thought i'd include a little idea of what my monthly budget looks like.

*rent: $500

*phone: $100

*electric: $75

*car insurance/gas : $100

*groceries: $300

*debt: $0

*everything else: $200-$400 (netflix, home supplies, eating out, personal care, etc.)

*total monthly budget: $1,275 - $1,475

*total needed net income to add $1,650 into savings plan: $2,925 - $3,125

"bf won't leave my scars alone and keeps bringing up things i've asked him not to. i finally snapped about it and he says i should be grateful.. some context first:

i'm(f) 19 this year, my partner(m) is 21. we've been together for about 6 months.
i've got minor-medium facial scarring on the left side of my face, and i have a prosthetic eye. short story short wear bike helmets and don't be a fucking idiot when you're with your friends.

alright, my boyfriend has been with me for 6 months now, and for the most part, we get along well. now i'm gonna admit, my temper needs work because i can be snappy sometimes but i've made clear from the start that i don't want to talk about my scars nor have them be touched etc. it makes me uncomfortable and generally ruins any good mood in the situation. 

my issue is he keeps doing things like touching them with his fingers and calling me beautiful as if i want reassurance about the most fucking horrible thing about me. i try to be nice about it, but i just can't make it clear enough how much i hate it. he also makes comments about how i should get some stupid weird looking prosthetic with patterns and stuff and he doesn't get that i just want to look normal, i just want to be allowed to forget about that stuff as much as possible. 

i guess the problem is he doesn't get just how serious it is to me and that making light hearted jokes about it just makes me feel like i'm different and i hate it. i already have stupid questions from people who don't know me well that make me feel insecure, but he knows me and has been told.

i snapped about it last night and he went off saying that i'm making a big deal out of nothing and i should be grateful he's trying. was i being unfair? i feel like it's okay for me to ask him to leave that part of me and my life alone so i can move on as best as possible but apparently not.",7

"if your child is obese (outside of medical reasons) it should be considered child abuse.. 
imo a dr or teacher should be able to contact cps for an investigation if a (young) child is morbidly obese. 

last night i saw 2 small children, brother and sister, who looked around 5 and 8 years old who were both massively overweight. it broke my heart to see them struggling to play, breathing heavily, and see their overweight mom hand then candy bars and chips. 

i don't know their circumstances and for the most part, i am indifferent to other's choices in raising their children. however, there is no reason a child that age should be obese (aside from a medical condition). a child that age is not in control of what they are given to eat and if you as their parent are over-feeding them junk to the point of childhood obesity, some sort of child abuse should be suggested. 

these poor kids have to grow up with the consequences of your bad eating habits and you are setting them up for health problems later in life. 

edit: thank you for mentioning the factors i naively missed such as poverty, the effects of corporations targeting children, and people who don't know better. these points are very valid and make a lot of sense. perhaps if counselors, teachers, doctors had the ability to become more involved in extreme situations (as some can with underweight, starving children) this could be a good place to start. 

i had no idea this was a ""re-post"". 

as anyone, i am speaking from my own experience and i did come from a family who struggled with money. i don't know how my parents managed to keep our meals balanced. 

 i think we need positive ideas of ways we can help prevent this problem. my doctor's office has material for families about healthy eating. i have seen free ""classes"" offered in the community for families about healthy eating. 

edit 2: i remembered more of our eating habits as a child. we had a garden, my dad's friend gave him grain that we ground up in a vitamix for flour, we ate a lot of rice, beans, veggies. we also spent a lot of time outside. all in all, education is a huge influencer and effort makes a difference!

"by forgetting i pranked my friend and accidentally giving him mild depression. mandatory this didn't happen today, but rather a few years ago...

back when i was at uni my best friend (james) and i used to always try prank each other creatively by getting on each other's facebooks/social media. think things like messaging our friends with odd messages trying to sell them a ridiculous pyramid scheme , changing each other's profile picture, etc... you get the idea.

one day near the end of my final year, we are in his room about to go for a night out and james goes to the bathroom, leaving his laptop unlocked (with facebook logged in). i take this as my opportunity to execute my latest master plan - i was going to change his post settings on facebook to ""only me"" (i.e. his posts would be invisible to anyone else) and post something outrageous and completely inappropriate (knowing he has his family on facebook). plan was that he would come in, see the post and freak out / get super pissed, for me to reveal the gaff to him and have a laugh.

however, i only managed to execute the first part of my plan (i.e. changing the setting to ""only me"") before he came back into the room, and i had to quickly exit facebook to avoid being found out.

now, the fuck up was that we went out, got quite drunk, came back home, and i completely forgot about this prank. fast forward to almost a year later...

my friend is still at uni (doing a masters degree) while i have moved to another city and started working. i should add that james is a big time electric guitar player, and in the last year got into recording videos of himself and posting them on youtube / social media. he messages me one day asking what i thought of his latest video on facebook. i went to his page and noticed there was no post... in fact, there were no posts for around a year...

i call him and tell him there's no post, to which he says that can't be, i posted it yesterday and am looking at the post now. i'm on the phone with him when it suddenly just \*clicks\* and i am immediately mortified - this entire time, i had left the ""only me"" setting on, and he hadn't realised. i hang up to compose myself before calling him back and telling him the truth.

for the last year or so, he had been posting several videos and had received 0 likes or comments. he had taken most of his previous videos down, had wondered why nobody liked his videos, if people just hated him since most of his friends graduated, if he was really crap at guitar... one thing he told me in particular was particularly heart-breaking - ""i often layed awake at night thinking about this"". i don't want to use the term depression too loosely, but it really affected him and he considered going for counselling.

luckily he was good about it and didn't hold a grudge, and we now laugh about it. bought him a lot of drinks next time i saw him though.

tl;dr  forgot i changed my friend's facebook settings so that nobody else could see his posts, he thought nobody liked him and was mildly depressed for a year.

edit: grammar

edit 2: i should add that i was of course extremely apologetic and remorseful after this happened, and still feel terrible when i think about it. he understandably was pissed at first, but realised it was completely accidental and was just a colossal fuck up. the ""reveal"" itself was over 6 months ago, i was reminded earlier today when i saw an obvious ""stupid facebook prank"". we still talk amost daily, and he is staying with me until he finds a flat once he also moves to the same city as me for work in a couple weeks (will make sure to keep my laptop locked though...)

edit 3: just to clarify, he wasn't just starting to play guitar. he has played since he was a kid and is genuinely a great guitar player. during his masters, he started filming cover videos/recordings as a hobby. his videos now get several likes and complimentary comments

edit 4: so a lot of people have been asking for posting a link to his videos. after watching this blow up, i called my friend and linked him the reddit. he is amazed and wants everyone to know he's fine. he isn't keen on me sharing his actual profile for privacy reasons, but said i could post some (starting with one) of his videos on a separate youtube account and linking it to this post. here is the cover he wanted to share with me that exposed the fuck up: https://youtu.be/eh\_m88iuovk(https://youtu.be/eh_m88iuovk).

"ca while on vacation, my landlord came into the house, locked my cat up without food, water, and litter box for at least 3-4 days. cat is ok, just a lot skinnier. we are breaking the lease to move out, is there any chance we can get our deposit back? landlord lives overseas.. san francisco, ca

hello, as the title stated, my landlord came by when we were on vacation (we knew about it), and started complaining about the house. one of the complaints was that the cat was roaming the house freely. we texted him and said that if you are locking up the cat, make sure she had her water, food, and litter box. 

we came home to the doors closed, and cat was in a room without any of the three essentials.  she clawed the carpet trying to get out, peed and pood everywhere, and most importantly, visibly skinnier. cat doesn't usually hang out in that room by herself, coupled with the landlord's complaint about her, we suspect he did it on purpose even though he insisted it was an accident. he is overseas now.

we don't really want the headache of pursuing legal action - cat is fine, just need to eat more, and we just want to move out asap and leave this behind us. is here anything we can leverage to keep our deposit? deposit is one month's rent.

edits: luci is really ok. her appetite is much smaller now than before so we will spoil her with wet food for the next few days. vet said play with her more to build up an appetite.

we don't want to sue for personal reasons. the landlord said they will pay for the damages of the room. 

the lease says if we move out we have to pay for all the remaining months' rent. we just want to say ""hey, this is the law, so we should get our deposit back, and not pay for the remaining months."" should we get a lawyer to write up something?

the landlord's complaints of the house weren't legit. they were about a dirty mug on our desk, us using a 100ft cable along the wall (stuck neatly to the wall with adhesive) to reroute the internet from the living room into the bedroom, detergent residue in the detergent dish of our washer, a blanket on the sofa, some amazon boxes by the hallway, and other trivial things, you get the idea.",2

"men face a more unrealistic standard of beauty than women, they just don't complain about it.. you hear it every day. women complaining about the unrealistic standard of beauty they are faced with. they act like its women and only women. 

well, hello brad pitt, ryan reynolds, ryan gosling, chris hemsworth, jason momoa, dwayne johnson, john cena, channing tatum, etc, etc...the list goes on.

the ""standard"" women face is for the most part weight. most overweight people have the ability to exercise and diet to cut their weight, and although theres a rare few who have conditions causing their obesity, most of them are just too lazy and lack the discipline to drop the pounds. plus there's all of those ""love your body"" campaigns trying to make overweight women feel like they're ""good enough"". at least they have makeup as a viable option.

 sure losing weight is hard but let's look at what men are facing.

let's start with height. gotta be 6ft or taller. 5'11 doesnt cut it, and apparently they can tell the difference. i'm kidding, they cant, but if they ask you, and you're 5'10 or 5'11, you better lie because apparently those few inches are a deal breaker. men face the same struggle with weight, *billy may's voice* -- but wait, theres more! do you have any idea how hard it is to get a ripped body like all those male celebs that parade around shirtless in the movies? its really fucking hard. for some people, it's not even possible. it goes beyond weight. female celebs get boob jobs, ass jobs, etc, which any woman can get, but the men have to train for years to get the body you see in movies and magazines. to top it off, we cant wear makeup either. not that we want to, but as a man you have to show every flaw you have, yet they call that plus sized female model who couldn't put down the fork the brave one.

so please, stop acting like women are the only one facing an unrealistic standard. sure men could complain, but complaining about it would make them seem like less of a man, so i guess that's another thing to add to the list.",6

"learn from my mistakes. if your employer promises you something, get it in writing. my former employeer screwed me out of two grand one month before my wedding. so ill start from the beginning. a few years ago i lost my front tooth, and couldnt afford to get a new one. company i worked for, whos name i wont disclose, promised me they were going to pay for me to get a permanent tooth. my supervisor approached me one day while i was out in the yard working, and told me that as a wedding present they would be buying me a new tooth. i never asked them to buy me one, but they wanted to thank me for the hard work and time i put into the company, and also make sure i looked good for the wedding pictures. i was so happy and so was my fiance. it was the nicest thing any company had ever done for me before, and i was very grateful for them. they made an appointment for me to go to their company dentist, and i got my date to get my bridge. now a day before the appointment, they told me to cancel the appointment, because they wanted to try and find a better deal. apparently he was charging them too much money and they wanted me to go someplace cheaper. this was a red flag to me, but they seemed sincere and assured me they were working on something for me. so i canceled and waited. this should have been my first warning sign that they had no intention of paying for my tooth.

two months went by, and they didnt tell me anything. i was starting to think that they were going to bail on their offer, but any time i asked about it they kept assuring me they would honor the agreement. last month they laid me off, and during the comversation my supervisor assured me they were honoring the agreement to pay for my tooth. my supervisor brought up the tooth, i didnt even ask about it. i had assumed they werent going to pay for it anymore. he assured me the company was going to pay for it and honor that agreement. they told me they would be in touch with me once they worked something out. well i went to a family friend and got the work done (for a discount also.) when i gave them the bill, they informed me that they had never intended to pay for my bill. they told me they had no idea who told me that (despite 4 managers proudly telling it to me) and said i had to pay for it myself. not only did they refuse to pay, but they made me look dumb for thinking they ever told me they were going to do it. i was furious. the only reason i got the work done was because they promised me they were going to do it.

so now here i am with a dental bill, because i trusted my employer to honor their promise. there is also nothing i can do about it, because it wasnt in writing and i cannot prove they promised to pay for it. i also know this is my own fault, i was stupid for not trusting my instincts. so if your employer promises you a raise, to pay for something, or to do anything for you. always, and i cannot stress this enough, always get it in writting.

"a company i'm doing freelance work for sent me 100k too much. so a small company in china that i've worked with the past few months has sent me the payment for my freelance work, but they accidentally wired over 100k (some odd number, not 100k on the dot) too much. this is the first time i've ever worked with them and this is the first payment that i've ever received from them. they sent it from hang seng, a hong kong bank, but the company itself is in shanghai, idk if this is out of the ordinary or not. they notified me of the mistake immediately after they sent the money and told me it was suppose to be for an american company, but i live in canada. i asked them how they could make that big of a mistake when my payment is supposed to be vastly smaller and i'm in a different country, and they said their finance guy got it mixed up and basically yolo'd it or something. they're asking for me to wire back the difference now. the whole situation is a little strange to me.


now, i've heard of scams with a similar premise before, and i think they're probably not out to scam me, but considering they accidentally sent over 100k to the wrong guy, i don't wanna get fucked somehow by their incompetence if not malice. i've already spoken with my bank through the phone and in person and they've given me different answers. the person over the phone suggested the safest way for me to give the money back is to tell them my bank can't do anything and see if they could speak with their bank and somehow get the transaction reversed on their end, whereas the branches i've visited in person said the sender can't reverse it on their end, so i have to send it back myself, with the sort of attitude basically telling me to ""get fucked kid we're not liable if anything happens"". i think i'm done with td after i get this sorted out.


so logically speaking, you'd think banks would be able to reverse international wires for exactly these sort of mistakes right? they can reverse it, right? so for now, i've told them to check with their bank first and see if they could get the transaction reversed. what's my next step if they say they can't? how do i protect myself for the worst case scenario? in what ways can they fuck me if they tried to?

- from a full video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3ec1_gcr34) that was originally posted by a religious(?) group that was there called the black hebrew israelites (bhi), it shows them street preaching to the na group, telling them that they're worshipping the wrong god, etc. some na people walked up to them offended and they got into a vocal spat at the beginning of the video. the group of kids aren't seen until 46:41(https://youtu.be/t3ec1_gcr34?t=2802), where one of the street preachers calls the kids fagg***, crackers, school shooters, etc) and they walk away ~5' later while they're being called animals. 





- the group of kids congregate off to the side seen on 1:05:00(https://youtu.be/t3ec1_gcr34?t=3927), waiting i assume for a bus to pick them up. bhi turns around and starts calling them names again and then the kids start what sounds like school chants and a mini haka at 1:09:00. i do not hear 'build a wall' in any of the videos. more kids meet up with the group; i guess that's the meeting place they were told to go to and they start doing another chant. one street preacher provides commentary on their chants. kids take a knee at 1:12:00 and bhi jokes(?) that they're kneeling to israel (them) and then the kids start another chant while the na group appears around 1:12:20 heading into the group of kids. some people in the na group were dancing as they meet the kids who were finishing up their chant. the kids turn around and start jumping up and down to the beat of the drums. no one tells the kids what they're doing; they're just beating drums at them and doing their own chanting. and while i might consider it disrespectful, it doesn't look malicious when the kids joined in the na chants (this is where all the shocking viral clips came from). these kids did not approach the na group, interrupting their ceremony. the rest of the video is bhi talking to some of the kids and trying to antagonize them.

- another video is one where the doxxed kid is standing in front of the elder.(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npx801xlsfy) the small group of kids confronting bhi starts chanting again and the rest of the group does as well. several kids in the back are dancing and look like they're enjoying listening to the drums and chanting from the na group. a couple of kids ask what is going on and wondering what the na group is doing at 1'06""(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=66) and 1'20""(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=82). people on social media were angry at pictures that looked like the doxxed kid was smirking at the elder, thinking that he was making fun of him or intimidating him. but it honestly looks like an awkward situation where someone approached right to him, looking at him and performing something. like, i myself would just stare and wait, listening until the elder was done like the kid was doing. 






- off to the side, a man from the na group is heard talking to another kid at 1:35(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=95), saying ""white people, go back to europe where you came from...this is not your land..."" things get heated, and the doxxed kid who's facing the na elder turns to the other kid at 2:09(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=129) and motions to him to just let it go and stop arguing while the elder is finishing his chant. that, to me, doesn't seem like a kid who is acting maliciously. things get even more heated from that one guy and it looks like some of the kids realize that these people don't like them and they walk away. the rest of the video is a kid again wondering what just happened, the na group finishes their performance and cheers w/ that one guy still being worked up, and more bhi preaching stuff where they call ""trump a homosexual""/rants about gays/etc(https://youtu.be/npx801xlsfy?t=437) and the kids are wondering where the buses are to leave and they get excited and chant again when the buses arrive.







- after looking at what i think is everything, it's clear the social media mob is going after them for no reason.  the viral clips look downright malicious and horrible out of context, especially when people who look at it automatically think these kids are evil just based on the hats they're wearing. it's clear they were not being malicious and it also looks like the viral clips were exploited for political propaganda. it's disgusting that adults would use kids this way for their own gain, and i'm sickened that people are still harassing and doxxing these kids. yesterday and even this morning there are people on social media who are asking their followers to literally assault these kids and ruin their lives for no reason except what they imagine. so far, 0 media organizations that wrote about the viral clips have not looked to see what actually happened. it's really disconcerting that we have reached the point at what i thought was still a civil society where hatred of someone is re-directed at kids.

"ellen degeneres is not funny and kinda creepy.. i know ellen degeneres is mentioned many times. the last time was 3 months ago. hoping to bring the discussion up again to hear from the new users. 

ellen degeneres is not funny. 
she sexualises her male guests. a lot. i don't understand why.
she has a weird vibe - in a way she is like the jesus for american middle class housewives. 
her youtube videos are not good either? but they get tons of views. ",6
"for telling the barista that my girlfriend is with me?. basically i'm 25m and she's 23f.

she gets company credit for food and drinks as she works for like a week at a time. she cooks all her own food and uses that money to buy a coffee each morning. she always goes to the same coffee shop. 

me and my gf are very comfortable and she's bi so sometimes we will both say how hot a girl is or whatever. she always says the guy who serves her coffee is ""beautiful"", she confirmed that she wasn't attracted to him but that he was stunning and a very pretty man. that was fine. 

anyway, so she goes in every day and always has stories to tell about the guy behind the counter. i trust her entirely, i know she doesn't really want him and wouldn't do anything. 

anyway, i went in the other day and straight away knew who she meant as this gorgeous long haired dude took my order. i ordered her favourite drink as she was at home and i shit you not he said ""oh is that for emma?"" and when i looked shocked he went ""i just know that's her usual, no one else really orders it"". i said yes, it is but by the way pal, she has a boyfriend and it's me. the guy kinda laughed and i said that i appreciate he's doing his job but to lay off her as in my eyes, i think he was flirting. he laughed again and said sure thing. 


i didn't tell my gf who went to get coffee a few days later and came home raging, saying how dare i embarrass her like that. this pissed me off cause why doesn't she want him to know?! she said she already mentioned me and that the guy is gay and she knows his boyfriend. 
fair, innocent mistake on my behalf but the gf never told me this beautiful man was gay. 

she stormed out and still won't speak to me without making sly digs. 

aita? 

**tl;dr** told the barista that my gf wasn't single and was with me as i thought they were flirting.",3
"men respect women more than women respect men. i know this sounds contrary to everything you've heard, but hear me out. from guys, i hear plenty of stupid comments. ""women are crazy"" ""women are too emotional"" ""women overreact to everything"". it's either making dumb jokes from their buddies or wondering why their girlfriend/wife is angry with them. 

but i've only heard genuine loathing from women. ""men are all the same"" ""men are trash"" they're monsters, creeps, and on and on. and it isn't just certain men. i've heard multiple women say that all men are like that, not just certain individuals. i've never heard any man say they hate all women, but i've heard women say they hate all men. 

lesser examples include the results from unhappy breakups. when men rant, it's about someone specific: ex-girlfriend or wife. if a woman's angry, it's a rant about the entire male gender. this is a generality of course and i can only speak from my own experience. 

then there's the constant messages to men about how to treat women. teach your son to respect women, teach men to respect women; treat your girlfriend like a princess, etc. constant posts about how men don't have empathy for women. but very rarely have i seen it in reverse. i've encountered it maybe twice in my life. many messages talking about how we need to respect women; very little about respecting men. 

i could go on and on. ",6

"accidentally watching a black mirror episode with audio description on. not today, but black mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and i just remembered my fuck up. 

said episode was ""shut up and dance"", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. 

now, i don't understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. so the narrator describes the characters' actions inbetween dialogues like, ""sister comes up and touches his hands"" and whatnot. 

had it been any other shows or movies, my wife and i definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. but of course, the black mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. 

i think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don't really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. we were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. 

well, the end was near, and came the twist. normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. we were like yeah, yeah, that's cool, so what was the voice? and to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.

we were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as black mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn't grasp anything. after some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  

tl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.





edit: mostly lurker, i don't know if there are any etiquettes i have to follow through, i will upvote everyone's comments for now.

for those who says it's not tifu, i guess it's mundane, that's true. since some folks are okay with the change of intensity? of fuck up, and so are mods,  i am at peace with it.",4

"by accidentally making my friend's parents think i was having lesbian sex with their daughter. obligatory this didn't happen today, but i was talking to my friend and remembered about this whole ordeal and thought i'd share.

this happened a few months ago, and for context, me and my friend are both 17 and female, and importantly one of our female friends had just come out as gay at the time. this meant that my other friend (the one who this is about, who i'll call h) had told her parents that one of her female friends was gay, but hadn't specified which one (important later).

so one day h invited me over to watch a film after school. when i arrived i said hi to her parents then went upstairs with h to her bedroom to watch the film. this is where the fuck up slowly started. first of all we closed the door, which is something that we never do when i visit her, but was important as we were watching a film and didn't want to be disturbed by her parents. then we turned the light out, again, uncharacteristic for us but important for watching a film. we really didn't think much about either of these things.

anyway, an hour later we were talking and laughing with the film in the background. now this is where i really fucked up, i was being uncharacteristically funny and was talking in a kinda flirty, sexual voice which one of the characters in the film had sounded like. h found this really funny so i continued with it and only spoke with that voice for a good 10 minutes or so, and we were both quietly laughing a lot. at some point during this time i heard her parents walk past the door but neither of us though much about it. some more important information to know is that h is asexual (meaning that she doesn't experience sexual attraction and doesn't want to have sex), and her parents don't know this about her because she doesn't like to talk to them about that kind of thing. this means that i constantly forget that most people don't know this about her.

another 20 mins past and then we heard footsteps and soft knocking on the door. we thought this was strange as they're the kind of parents to barge into a room without announcing their presence. h shouted at them to just come in the room and then we heard the sliding of paper under the door. we were very confused and just watched this piece of paper awkwardly sliding and then heard footsteps walking away. h picked up the paper and it said ""we're going to get mcdonalds for dinner do you want anything?"".

we were both seriously confused about why they had felt the need to tell us via paper, in such an awkward way rather than just opening the door to ask. then it dawned on me and i turned to h and asked her ""do your parents think we were fucking?"", at first she looked at me with a look of confused disgust, wondering why the hell i had said that, then slowly her expression turned to that of horror and realisation. we had closed to door, turned of the lights, had been quietly giggling, i had been talking in a flirty voice for an extended period of time... not to mention the fact that neither one of us can sit still for more than 10 seconds so there had certainly been lots of bed creaking and sheet rustling sounds. also her parents knew that one of her two female friends was gay just didn't know which one it was, and didn't know that their daughter was asexual so would never want to have sex anyway.

we immediately turned the lights on and opened the door, but by then it was too late. when we went downstairs to say what we wanted from mcdonald's her parents couldn't look either one of us in the eye, and were talking to us really awkwardly. after the mcdonalds i left and h spent a lot of time subtly clearing it up with her parents, such as mentioning the name of the friend who was gay, and bringing up that i had a boyfriend (which her parents didn't know about). i think they realised that they had got it wrong but those moments of awkwardness were horrific. luckily all has been fine since, but now whenever we meet up we make sure to keep the door open.

tl;dr went round to a female friend's house to watch a film, we did a series of uncharacteristic stuff that led her parents to believe that we were having sex... now when we meet up we keep her bedroom door open.",4
"my twin sister is dating my rapist and i'm unsure what to do.. throwaway as this is kinda nsfw

around 2 years ago my at the time boyfriend got me drunk and forced me to have sex with him, i've still got trauma from it and have been seeing a counselor. 

my sister kept on telling me she had a new man but wanted to keep it secret as it's still relatively new, i accepted that and never cared that much. 

turns out that the guy she is dating is my ex boyfriend. i'm pissed and have not spoken to her, the only thing i've gotten from here is a facebook messenge from her telling me how i can't controll her boyfriends. 

i feel that he might be using her to get to me or using her as she looks like me. 

mum and dad are on my side but still want to be there for my twin.

we are both 21.

"when i was 11, my dad's girlfriend's 22 year old son used to regularly beat my dad up to a bloody pulp in-front of me. i'm 30 now, and i'm still haunted by it... i turned 30 recently, and since then, a lot of things have been bringing up some of the skeletons from my past... i'm realising that i'm still deeply affected by them, and still haunted by them to this day. and honestly, i just wanted to share it with someone..

when i was 11, i remember being one of the happiest, goofiest, rambunctious, cockiest, *naughtiest* kids there was. i had so many friends, played sports, had all these play ""girlfriends"" with all the girls in my class, and had so many healthy experiences living in the suburbs of melbourne, australia. i was just happy and bubbling with life and confidence living with my single dad.

just before the 6th grade, my dad met a woman. her name was dianne. she was also a single parent, except her kids were much older than me. she had three boys between the ages of 22 and 35 at the time, and an 18 year old daughter. 

after a few short months of knowing this woman, my dad broke the news to me that we were leaving melbourne, and moving in with diane to a small rural town in the country. at such a young age, i didn't understand exactly what this meant. but i went along with it, without so much as a peep or murmur.

soon, we moved to the small country town called pylong, in victoria. this town had maybe 1,000 people living in it. and my new school, in total, had maybe 50 kids. my first day of school there was a real indicator of my temperament, as i'd cause the first fist fight in all of the school's history literally in my first day. the reason? simply because another student suggested that i pick a fight with someone. there was no reason. i was wild!

very soon after my dad moved us in, diane allowed her youngest son, peter, to move in with us. peter was 22, lifted weights, and was an absolute monster. my dad was 55. soon after peter moved in, even though my dad bought this house from sale of his previous home, peter began to claim it as his own. he began bullying and intimidating my dad. peter would change the locks and bolts on my dads tool shed so that only he would have access to it. peter used to play with my basketball in the back yard, then kick it as hard as he could across the 1 acre paddock behind us into the overgrown grass so that i couldn't find it after he'd finish. peter would push me over and trip me when i'd try stand up to him.

peter began to regularly beat up my dad. to a bloody pulp. in front of me. 

peter's temper was like a hair-trigger, and anything would prompt him to hurt my dad. sometimes my dad would react a little to peters bullying, and then it would be on. at any time of day or night, peter would just lay into my dad until he'd have broken noses and chunks of hair missing from hair scalp..

one night, my dad was sleeping in my room with me to get away from peter. it was like he was hiding in my room. at about midnight, peter came in to my room with his older brother while we were both sleeping and started both beating my dad up together. 

sometimes when this would happen, i'd run to the next door neighbor's house and beg them to let me inside to call the police. but other times, i'd just stand there in fear watching it... frozen. 

though i only lived there for about 1-2 years, it felt like forever. i'd pass the time after school and on weekends, by literally breaking into whole streets of houses not far from my own. i wouldn't steal anything. i'd just break and enter, walking around in the houses of strangers. i had no friends, i had no outlets, i had nowhere to go, and no one to see... i missed melbourne so so much, and felt like i'd been ripped out of my happy, bright environment in the suburbs, and placed in this town that felt like a prison made of dirt roads and nothingness. i felt isolated, alone, and like i was taken away from everything that made me happy...  i yearned to go back to melbourne where i had friends who loved me, and where ever hung could be normal again. where i could be normal. 

this all happened for about two years. but for my entire teenage life, i was withdrawn into myself. i was shy, embarrassed, scared, quiet, frozen, all through my highschool years... it took me until i was about 20 to come back out again, resembling what i was like in my previous childhood years.

and this might be a story for another time. but all throughout this time, for my whole life, i was also dealing with an alcoholic mother who i'd see on weekends. my experiences with her equally devastated me. she committed suicide (i believe) when i turned 17.

i never forgiven diane or peter. im haunted by them. i sometimes imagine what i would do if i could pay them both a visit, and let them know exactly what they put me through. i'd tell diane that she is a horrible human being, and i'd tell peter (and his brother) that i'm not 11-12 years old anymore, and that iv been lifting some weights of my own.

sometimes i still feel trapped in that house. iv never felt closure or resolution. iv never felt justice or peace... it's hung over me for all these years, and i don't know how to answer to it. i don't know how to forget it all..

i don't remember diane or peter's last name. sometimes i think that that's god's way of not allowing me to do something that i could regret..

thank you for reading my story. 

edit: thank you so much to everyone for your support and encouragement. iv very rarely spoken to anyone about the things such as this that iv experienced in my life, and i'm so grateful for all your thoughts and replies:

1. yes, i absolutely do want to resolve this against peter legally. my dad had called the police, so there would have to be a record of it somewhere. does anyone know how i could follow this up? or if it's too late? how can i make him answer to what he did? if you have any suggestions please feel free to pm me.

2. i see a lot of people are asking about my dad and how he is now. after i left his house when i was 16 (new house we moved into after it all happened), i dropped out of highschool, and moved to sydney with the little amount of money i had. i built a life for myself there, independently.
meanwhile, my dad went into business with his daughters husband, sold it after about 10 years, and used the money to retire on his eldest daughters property in his travel caravan. he loves it, and occasionally takes long solo trips around the outback of australia with his dog. he's at rest, and i am incredibly relieved for him.

"i had cancer at 22, now i have 7 debt collectors threatening me for money, while i'm still trying to finish college.. ok, here we go. i'm a full time college student. i took out loans for all of it. i'm $30k in debt studying land surveying. it's a really physical job so i can't get an internship until i'm healthy again. i'm 2 years from graduating. 

this last summer, i was diagnosed with non hodgkin lymphoma. luckily, 3 months before i got diagnosed i got a form a obamacare. so my insurance covered like 95% of the hospital bills. i went to 3 different hospitals for treatment and was seen by atleast 30 doctors over the last 4 months. each doctor billing me/my insurance company.

i had to leave my apartment complex and move out without 60 day notice and my cats ruined my carpet so my apartment complex billed me $1200 and sent me to a debt collector. 

my brother was nice enough to let me live with him debt free for a while to get back on my feet but there is no end in sight. 

 i just finished my last round of chemo, so now it's time to worry about the bills. well, each bill, was sent to a debt collector because i didn't pay any of them while i was getting treatment. it was obviously the last thing on my mind. well, since i've been in school for four years, federal aid told me they're going to start charging me monthly because i've reached my borrowing limit.

 so in total, my credit is ruined, i might not be able to finish school and get a job, i'm barley able to work part time as it is right now, and i'm bringing in no more than $500 a month. my car insurance, car payment, school repayment, credit card payments (isn't much), debt collectors, and left over hospital bills, i just don't know what to do. my family has no money as it is so they can't help and i've applied to atleast 10 different financial aid assistant programs through the hospitals but it just isn't helping. 

i added up all my credit card and debt collector debt and it's $4500. my hospital debt is $10k and counting. my school loans are $30k and i still owe $5k on my car. i'm just so afraid i'm going to lose everything and it's not even my fault. 

any advice on where to start would be amazing. thank you all for reading.
