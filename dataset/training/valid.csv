"for wanting to go to the funeral of a girl that i helped get addicted to drugs?. i'm 26 and clean from heroin for 3 years. 

i was also a piece of shit and used to deal for a while. 

i managed to get with a beautiful girl named marcy when i first started getting into the thick of things. she knew who i was but she said she loved me. 

i will regret this for the rest of my life, but i was the person who shot up marcy for the first time. after that, there was no stopping her. she stuck around with me, probably because i was her dealer more than anything, but then i got clean and never saw her again for a long time. 

a year ago she reached out to me on facebook and told me that she had been clean for a few months and she said that she didn't hate me for what happened and she hoped i was still clean. 

last week i got a call from my sister who told me that she saw on facebook that marcy had od'd and there was a funeral service this upcoming thursday.

i immediately just burst into tears because i hoped that this would never happen and i feel so much guilt over it. 

i want to go to the funeral service for her but i'm afraid that my presence would be unwanted. at the most i would just slip in the back, pay my respects and leave. i need to do this for myself.

"son has a peanut allergy, school continues to give him or allow him to get peanuts.. this has been an ongoing issue since the second day of school, where he was given peanut butter crackers. we sort of brushed it off as a new school year, new students, teachers a bit frazzled dealing with first graders no real big deal. his allergy isn't really severe but still not fun to deal with and can potentially become life threatening.

we had already informed the school of his allergy before the year started and even talked directly to the teacher about it because the default snack during the day if no other parents brought in a snack in peanut butter crackers. we even offered to purchase a special alternative for him, but they said it was unnecessary as they have other alternatives.

so we figured the issue was over when a few weeks later it happened again, this time they claimed he grabbed another students snack and ran off to eat it before they could stop him. now my little one can be a little bit of a hard head and i can potentially see this happening so again we talked to him about peanuts and how dangerous they are to him. he continued to adamantly deny doing that and said mrs gave them to him. 

we then decide a meeting with the principal is in order, not to blame the teacher or accuse her of lying but to hopefully get this under control. again a few weeks of no more issues, then it happened again.

once again the story is ""he grabbed it and ran off and ate the whole package before we caught him"". okay so a 6 year old managed to grab an unopened package of crackers, elude a teacher and an aide and eat the whole package before he's caught? he's crying and swearing to us he was given them, and after so many incidents we have to start believing him. 

another meeting with the principal and teacher gets us a ""do not worry! this won't happen again"". we have another long sit down with our son to explain that even if it's given to you, ask to make sure it doesn't have peanuts or other nuts in it.

then, the very next school day (the meeting was on friday) he's given another snack of peanut butter crackers but this time he asks if there is nuts in it and then he's given the alternative. we figure it kind of sucks that the kid has to be the adult right here but at the end of the day he's learning to ask about nuts. we send an email to the principal detailing the issue and say that the next stop is the school board if he is given peanuts again. we get a response back ""if he's asking now what's the problem? he should have known to ask to begin with. we are teachers not parents.""

we have no issues for a while until this week. some parent brought in pb&j sandwiches for snack time and he was given one. he forgot to ask about nuts but thought ""it was only in the crackers"". we find out the parent was aware of a nut allergy in the class (it's on the parent snack sheet) and brought in just a jelly one that was made separate from the peanut butter one's. he was not given this one. we spent a day at the hospital.

we've had endless talks with him about nuts and do our best to teach him but some of the blame has to be on the teachers here right? do schools not have an obligation to deal with allergies? the school lunch seems to have zero issues with this and has never given him a nut when there are several things on the menu rotation that contain them. he gets a special tray that was no where near any nuts. this is in indiana, any help is appreciated.",2

"for not picking my girlfriend up for a birthday meal and telling everyone she is probably asleep because she ignored my text. unfortunately my girlfriend's social skills aren't excellent and as a result whenever she is annoyed at me she is totally incapable of expressing why she is annoyed, so she resorts to totally ignoring me.

yesterday at 1:00 we were supposed to meet up for a birthday meal for a good friend. in the morning i sent her a few messages saying ""what time should i pick you up"" and such, all of which went ignored. i decided to just pretend that she was asleep and i went without her. when i arrived i just made a joke saying ""i think she's still asleep"", she hasn't replied to any of my messages. at about 12:45 i got a string of messages asking where i was and what's going on. i just played dumb and said ""wait, you're ready? i thought you were still in bed or something??""

i knew fine well that she was ready to leave the house but i didn't want to play this stupid game and i don't like the disrespect of being totally ignored like this, so i just decided to not pick her up.

**original** 

i \42m\ am a single father to my daughter \14f\. my wife passed away with excessive bleeding after childbirth, so it's just me and her. she's a fantastic young lady, always on honor roll, really good at basketball, and a social butterfly. she doesn't see too much of me because i work 9-7, but i'm home for dinner and she's started getting really good at cooking something little for both of us.

around tuesday, i noticed there was something off about her. she was a whole lot quieter than she usually is and there was no chatter during dinner. right after dinner she went up to her room, even though typically we sit and watch tv together. i figured it was just moody teenage hormones. except it doesn't stop. friday i finally take her hands and ask her what was wrong. she looked at me and just burst into tears. she cried more, so i held her until she was ready, and that's when she whispered, ""i'm pregnant.""

i was shocked. utterly and completely shocked. i kept on hugging her, but my mind had gone blank. i took her upstairs, tucked her into bed. i didn't think asking her about what she planned to do when she was so vulnerable was a good idea, i'd wait until she calmed down a little. saturday she came down for breakfast and i sat her down and asked her her plans. she said under no circumstances will she abort the baby, it's her baby and she plans to keep it full-term. i then asked about adoption, and she said she didn't want to, that she could care for it. i calmly explained that we were no way financially able to care for a baby, and who would take care of it during the day? i go to work, she goes to school, and my parents, although were a big help in taking care of my daughter when she was younger, are too old to watch a baby. she suggested she start online school, which i refused, saying i don't want her to ruin her life.

the thing is, i don't even want to consider adoption. i can't imagine her going through pregnancy, then labor, especially with what happened to her mother. i don't know if high-risk pregnancies are genetic but if she has one, what if i lose her?i told her this, and she asked me if i had no love for my grandchild. but i don't. i don't care at all about the clump of cells in her uterus, i care about her. the girl i raised. i told her today that she had to abort her child. she cried, screamed, begged, telling me to reconsider, telling me that she'd run away. there's no way i'm letting her give birth, she could tear her body apart. and for school, i don't want her to face the stigma and hurt of teen pregnancy.

at this point, i see only one way out of this, and that's telling her if she doesn't abort it, i'm kicking her out. it hurts me so much to do this but if she doesn't do one, i'm afraid her life will truly be over. i won't actually, but i'm hoping it'll push her in the right direction. i'm pretty much manipulating her, but how do i get out of this?

where do i go from here?

tl;dr: my daughter's pregnant, we can't afford a baby, she doesn't want to give it up or abort it

**update**

so today she didn't go to school and we went to the local clinic to her checked out. it's been confirmed: she's definitely pregnant, about 13 weeks along. everything's fine so far, but she's automatically high-risk because she's a teenager. they said she could develop anemia, low blood iron, or blood pressure problems, and on top of that the baby could also be born with disabilities. 

after the doctor's i took her out for ice cream and then asked her who the father was. i told her i had to know, she had to tell me. she refused, saying she'd raise the baby on her own, without his help. we went home and she went to the bathroom and accidentally left her phone open, so i took it and looked through her messages. according to the ones between her and her friends and her and the guy, he's 15 years old and a friend of a friend. she hadn't told him yet.   
i wrote down his number and then messaged him on my phone, telling him i was \daughter's name\ dad, and i needed him to give me his mother's number because of a big problem. i expected something of a fight but the kid messaged it back to me, so i called his mom and i told him my daughter was pregnant, and her son was the father. she asked if i was sure, and i said based off the texts, it didn't seem like she'd had sex with anybody else, but she'd be free to get a paternity test. i said it'd be best if we got together at a coffee shop or something to talk, but she said there'd be no need of that. she said her son would be waiving his parental rights and they were not interested in a co-parenting situation. i asked about child support, and she said her husband would pay it, but her son would not be involved. she asked for me to not tell her about any details of the pregnancy and they don't want to be at any appointments. she hung up before i could say anything else. 

now i don't know where i stand. i can't afford a lawyer, and i don't think i can make him get involved either way. i don't entirely trust them to be accommodating in terms of child support considering how short his mother was. is there a way they could get out of paying it? i don't know enough about their family but if they have money and we don't, what's happening there?

my daughter is no closer in getting an abortion or considering adoption, but i'm going to stop peppering her with it now. my sister and her are talking right now at the suggestion of another redditor, and i hope a female influence will work better on her than i am. she's sending a little bit of money, and i think i may be able to set up a therapy appointment for her to talk out her options in a professional way, something my sister and i can do.

"i (36m) think my wife of 8 years (31f) is having an affair with our couples therapist (42m). throw away for obvious reasons.

so my wife and i have been having some communication issues for about a year or so and started to see a marriage counselor about 7 months ago.  at first it's good and we start communicating better.  

about three months ago she starts going to extra sessions for ""self care"". alone.

around this time our couples sessions that happen with all three of us together (about three months ago) become much more one sided with me being the ""bad guy"" and the two of them kind of teaming up on me.

she starts telling her friends about ""danny"" and how great he is for her ""self care"" but if her friends seem interested in making an appointment she says ""he only does couples"" or ""he's not taking new clients""which i think is weird because we have normally referred to him as ""dr. soandso"" and now he is suddenly ""danny"".  (i don't know if he is actually not taking new clients.)

around the time they started teaming up on me in the sessions (about three months ago) was around the last time my wife and i were intimate.

there have been a couple of other weird coincidences that i thought were puzzling, but three nights ago my wife said she had an emergency with her sister and had to go see her right away.  she went to the bathroom and showered and put on perfume and left.  it was about 9;30 at night and that seemed really odd to me.

about a half hour later i tracked her iphone and the location showed up as his office.

when she came home 3 hours later, i asked how her sister was and she kind of gave a weird ""oh you know jenny, drama queen"" kind of answer.

i think i'm going to confront them in the session this thursday.",8
"by putting a thong that was not my wife's in her underwear drawer. this happened 2 days ago. so last week i found a thong on the floor in my living room. smelt it like the animal i am, was clean, and put it in my wife's underwear drawer.

2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.

huh... i found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? it was clean so i put it in your drawer. what it's not yours?

angrily, she answers it's not hers. you just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?

i tell her what the hell am i suppose to say. she goes back upstairs really angry at me.

so last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. i send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. it is. we're both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... we came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...

now the real fuck up. my wife is in the bed. i go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. just texted her and the thong is hers. the only explanation we managed to find it's that it was stuck by static at her clothes.

you want me to believe that?! that makes no sense

jesus christ, i don't even believe my explanation myself. i tell her to believe what she wants, i don't fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that i don't have anything to redeem myself. i take some clothes and go sleep at my parents' home.

the next morning she calls me. she tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it's logical that i'd put it in her drawer. and if i was cheating on her, i'd be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.

tldr : found my friend's thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife's underwear drawer. almost lost my wife to it.

edit : omg it exploded. thanks for the silver mystery redditors! i know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that's ultimately your right! had fun with the others that told similar stories :) and yes, i told my friend that i sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.

i met a girl online and we clicked, and have gone on a couple dates. two nights ago was our third date and i was treating her to dinner at a local burger place in the city. nothing fancy, i just wanted some good conversation over a tasty meal. this girl is a knockout, has the rare quality of being a great listener, and isn't obsessed with herself. she's funny, charming, and smart. we had had several great dates and i was getting close to asking her to be my girlfriend. she is also the one who called me an asshole before the night was done (not her exact words, but we'll get there.)

our waitress for dinner was great. actually enthusiastic and friendly, on point with the refills, and just top notch service all around. at one point in the evening she did spill a partially-full glass of water on our table, but it wasn't really her fault because she had gotten bumped into, and she was very quick to apologize and wipe the table dry with a smile on her face, so if anything that was a point in her column.

at the end of the meal, she brought the check and i told her i would like to speak with her manager. she asked if there was something wrong, and i calmly repeated that i would like to speak with her manager and could she please go get him. she leaves and reappears with the manager a few moments later, and i proceed to tell him that we had gotten *excellent* service that night, and that (her name) was one of their best. he thanked me for the feedback and she also looked very happy at the compliment and thanked me.

the only one not happy was my date. she said, ""if that was supposed to impress me, it didn't."" and said that i was full of myself. she didn't say much else as we gathered our things to leave and there was no kiss at the door that night. i texted her saying i was sorry for whatever i did wrong and that i'd like to see her again soon, so far no response.

"by tricking my hospitalized brother into thinking the world ended. obligatory wasn't today, this happened a couple months back. my brother and i have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). this agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so i was convinced he still remembered.

a couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as ""an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones"". eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. i got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. i decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. 

near the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. there's a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it's for. so i went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of ""brother's name, if you're watching this, i'm already dead. everyone on the world pretty much is. it's been about eight months since you went to hospital name. you need to head for the safe haven in helsinki (we live in western canada) - mom might be there. god speed."" i managed to sync it up to the tv and woke him up as it was starting.

this is where it all goes to complete shit. my brother began to lose it immediately. he started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. i grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. nurses came in and i was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).

he got out a couple days later, and we've been laughing about it ever since. my mom won't talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. my dad thinks it's funny but won't laugh about it in front of my mom. i'm no longer welcome at a hospital unless it's an emergency. i've also been kicked out of a family vacation.

worth the wait though.

tl;dr: convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital

edit: wow this blew up?! i don't have a ton of time but:

1) i don't want to upload the video. i made it sound tamer than it was, i look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don't want to be associated with it xd

2) the tvs in the hospital had hdmi ports. i just plugged it into my chromebook. 

3) i can see why people say i made this up for karma, but i didn't create a throwaway to do that.  if i cared that much, i would've posted it on my main account.

4) my mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. she hasn't been happy with me moving (western canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. she paid for it though and can't get a refund for my ticket so it's not my problem.",4

rm= roommate's mom   r=roommate

i came back from my morning run around 7 am this morning, and rm and r were in the kitchen making some coffee. she has never been there this early before. 

i decided to talk to them about everything prior to going to class. i atarted off with ""hey auntie, can we talk?"" (in brown culture everyone is called an aunt) and these are some points i listed:

1. i appreciate that she has been cooking and cleaning, but i want to do that on my own. i love to cook and felt that i was never allowed in my own kitchen. i also told her that i want to do my own laundry and clean my room myself. 

2. i don't want her in my room. i reminded her that i talked to her about this when it first happened, and that's why i put the lock on the door.

3. i told her that if she wants to be with r, to let r text me and lmk that rm would be in the apartment. 

they expressed understanding and i hugged it out with rm. 

before going to class, i put a load of laundry. my friend is having a birthday dinner today, and i decided to wear this cute white dress with an open back (my mom even got me this dress since she thought it was so cute) and tossed it in the washer so it could be fresh for tonight. i asked rm multiple times if she was planning on doing laundry today, and she said no. i told her that i would be back around 1, and she can do laundry when i finish mine later this afternoon if needed (i didn't want her touching my clothes). she was okay with it and said r didn't have laundry today. cool. i left feeling really relieved, but i still locked my bedroom door. 

i got back to my apartment about half hour ago, and i couldn't find my white dress. as soon as i came home, r looked nervous. my clothes were in the dryer, and i didn't do that for a fact. rm states that i put them in the dryer and just forgot. ughhh. i locked myself in my room, and i know she probably took the dress as it was something she wouldn't approve of.

when i was in my room, i heard rm talking to r in our language, she told her daughter something along the lines of ""idk why she's freaking out about that dress. in india, escorts and prostitutes wear those kinds of clothing."" and she went on to tell r that i won't find a husband wearing stuff like this.

i honestly think she wanted me to hear all that.Â  is she is seriously just being a passive aggressive bitch to me rn? i'm trying so hard not to break down and cry. 

i'm heading over to my parents right now and i'm telling them everything when they come back home tonight. i'll keep you posted.

"i (28m) with fiance (27f) about a month ago overheard her tell a friend her previous ex was the best lover she ever had. it was quite by accident that i heard this.  we had a group of our friends over and as the night went on we all kind of busted out into little groups.  some of us were in one room playing texas holdem and a couple of others were watching a lord of the ring marathon.  i thought she was watching the movies but she and one of her close friends were actually sitting in the kitchen drinking coffee and talking.  our group had run out of soda so i got up to go to the kitchen to get drinks and  a couple of snacks.  as i'm rounding the corner i hear my fiance talking and before i completely come in the room i hear her clearly say ""jason is great but he will never be the lover that bill was"" she then followed it up with ""its not really fair to jason though, bill was just really gifted down there"".

at first i thought about just walking back into the card game and pretending like we didn't have any extra soda or food but i decided to kind of make a noise and go in.  her friend caught eye of me rounding the corner and i could see her make a face to my fiance letting her know i was there.  of course she has no idea i heard her and she just stops talking to her and asks me how i'm doing and if i'm having fun.  i was tempted to say something like ""i'm having as much fun as someone who is not gifted down there can"" but i didn't.  i just said yes and proceeded to get my stuff and go back and finish the night.  i just acted like nothing was wrong the rest of the night and went to bed.

needless to say it fucked me up.  i mean fucked me up bad.  i've never been jealous or what you would call insecure about myself until that moment.  i couldn't sleep that night and i went through a myriad of emotions while laying there.  at first i was angry.  then i was humiliated.  then i was depressed.  then i was angry again.

look i realize that the male ego seems stupid to women and even guys who are totally self assured.  i would have agreed with most of this prior to that night but once it has been damaged it is a bitch.

i tried to hide any form of emotion about it or ever let her know but as the days went on i just kept getting worse and worse.  i was avoiding her at all costs and while she was suspicious she didn't really say anything.  that is until she attempted to be intimate with me a few days later and i flat out rejected her.  it wasn't by a conscious decision on my part  by the way.  i had made the decision on my own to just try and get over it and move on.  but in the moment instead of being sexually aroused i felt deeply inadequate and ashamed.  nothing was happening no matter how much either of us tried.

she asked me what was wrong and i just told her i must have been stressed from work but she would not believe that or let it go.

so much to my humiliation there i laid, naked in bed, unable to get an erection.  i came clean and told her what i heard.

well this did not go over well at all.  at first she tried to tell me i did not hear her correctly.  but i just repeated to her verbatim what she had told her friend.  well once she couldn't deny it she then tried to apologize and to her credit she tried to listen to my feelings on the matter.  which once again i am sure was more of a big turn off for her because i was a wreck emotionally.

she tried to tell me how much of a better person i was and how i satisfied her and she wanted nobody else.  but all i could hear was charlie browns teacher noise.

it's been almost a month and i have zero desire to be with her sexually.  none.  she is now getting frustrated about this as well but no matter what i have tried i just can not get past this.  it's not like she said we were both good lovers or anything like that.  she clearly said he was far superior and my guess is that being gifted down there means he was significantly larger than me as well.  well i know i can do all kinds of things with my hands, tongue and whatever else.  but no matter what i do i can't grow in size.  obviously she refuses to talk about that with me saying that no matter what she say's it will only make things worse because even if she say's something positive about me i won't believe her.  she's most likely right.

some back story here.  he dumped her.  it was not a mutual breakup, he flat out dumped her and broke her heart.  i know this because early on in our relationship she told me this.  she said she wasn't ready to be serious about anybody because her previous ex left her and emotionally broke her.  so this is not a case of me even being able to say ""well she's with me because she wants to be"".  if he hadn't dumped her she would never have left him.  now i have no idea if after all of these years she would leave me for him if he would come back but i don't think she would.

i just don't know what to do here.  i can feel myself checking out of the relationship.  i know this is petty as shit but hearing the person you love tell someone else they prefer to have sex with someone else is just devastating to me.  her telling me all of my other good qualities has only made it worse because she is saying things that i think appeal to her and maybe other women but being told i am a good provider and will make a great husband makes me feel like shit.  like what would happen if i lost my good paying job or better yet what if i were to get injured and couldn't make anything more than state assistance, would she be there to support and help me?  basically what i feel like right now is a really good friend who she just allowed to have sex with.  i know in my head that this is not correct but in my heart that is what i feel.

i'm sorry for the length here and i don't even know what i am asking here.  i am totally lost and if this continues i just think i am going to break our engagement.

tl;dr:  heard fiance tell her friend that previous ex was superior in the sack (presumable due to size among other things), relationship has gone to hell since and i need advice.

&#x200b;

edit:  holy god.  i made this post last night and answered a couple of questions and then went to bed and got up today and went christmas shopping hoping to make me forget my troubles and didn't even log in until just now.  i have not even started to read the (at this point) 7.7 thousand comments on this post.  i don't know what anyone has said yet but thank you all for commenting either way.  i am now going to begin the massive undertaking of looking at the comments.  also thank you for the gold and silver kind internet strangers.

edit 2:  dear god.  i read all the way down to the bottom of the page thinking i had gotten through most of everything and then at the bottom it said load the 5.5k more posts.  i'm stopping for the night (well morning actually).   i was going to respond to people individually but there is just no way.  i haven't even started reading the direct messages to me yet nor have i opened any of the 20 chat screens.  there are issues i want out there because there are a couple of things that are being said that are not accurate.

1.  she was to use the barney gumble phrase using ""sweet sweet drunk talk"".  in other words her and her friend were drunk while talking.  nope, neither of us drink.  we don't even have it in the house.
2. that i am upset she told her friend.  well this is an odd thing, before i posted this honestly i wasn't that upset about this part.  i was then and am still far more upset that this is how she feels.  however now reading a lot of the post i have become somewhat aggravated that she did share this with her friend.  i would never say anything about her to anyone that would put her in a lesser light.
3. that i am an insecure man child who should just man up and learn to do better.  well i'm certain the first part is true, being insecure and all.  but the last part is just out of my control.  no matter what i do i will only ever be 7"" long.  we have talked about this btw, when she was trying to build me up.  she said that i was already great with everything but the one thing i can't control. (okay, so i gave myself about a half inch to feel better)
4. no i'm not going to do anything rash.  it's already been a month so its not like this happened last week.  but yes i have to decide what i am going to do here before long.  it's not fair to either of us is i am just coasting through this and no longer committed.
5. she is sorry that i heard it.  she said she is sorry she said it but at the end of the day she would not be sorry if i didn't catch her saying it.  it is what it is.  but yes i do believe she is regretting it because she has basically been a mess since i first told her.  me not wanting to be with her is bothering her a lot according to her.  i don't know how much of that i believe but right now i guess i don't know why she would lie.  it really has wrecked hell on our christmas spirit this year i know that. 

edit 3:  engineer for those who keep asking what i do for a living.  she is a paralegal.  
edit 4:  people have been asking about the relationship with the ex and how i know she was heartbroken.  we met about 9 months after they separated.  i know that ultimately he wanted to be with someone else, although she has claimed he never cheated.  he just ended things so he could be with another woman.  she approached me at a local workshop and we started dating .  on our 4th date when things started to get physical she broke down crying about the ex.  it was certainly weird to hold someone while they cried about someone else but i did it.  we sporadically dated for a couple more months in which time i never tried to cross any boundaries physically because it was obvious she wasn't over him so while we just went out of dates i tried to keep myself of the mind that we were just friends because i didn't want to commit either.  after close to two months she drags me from my car to her apartment and begins to tell me how much she has appreciated my patience with her and how she felt stupid about dragging me along for so long.  obviously that was our first night together.  within 3 months of that she is telling me that she loves me.  so yes, she was still hung up on her ex for fact when we got together.  i had thought/hoped she was over him before this happened.

edit 5:  okay i posted it below in the mass of other posts but i have also started a new post and hopefully the mods let it stay open.  https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/a55jy1/posting_general_response_here_i_28m_with_fiance/?

"for kicking out my girlfriend because she said my relationship with my brother was disgusting.. i'm(22m) a legal guardian of my 15 year old brother. we're very close and we have always been like that. he lives with me now obviously. he often gets really sad, we recently lost our parents, so i comfort him as best as i can. 

so, about my girlfriend, we have been together for 2 years. she doesn't live with me, she stays over really often tho, so she has the house keys.

2 days ago, she came over without warning me. me and my brother were asleep on couch, he wasn't wearing a shirt because it was hot, and he was laying on top of me. she woke us up and made a scene in front of him. she said that our relationship was weird and disgusting and it's extremely concerning that he's so affectionate towards me. my brother was in tears and he even apologized to her. i brought him to his room and calmed him down. 

i went back to living room, she was sitting on couch, watching tv and acting like nothing happened. i told her to get the fuck out. she got defensive again and said that she was just stating her opinion without hurting anyone. i grabbed her wrist and brought her to door. i didn't hurt her, she was following me, i didn't use any force. she left, she called me few times but i didn't answer.


update: thanks for all the comments. i talked to her, she still said that she didn't do anything wrong,she didn't hurt my brother and it wasn't her fault that he started crying. i broke up with her. 

also little info: this doesn't happen often, we were on couch, watching tv and fell asleep. he laid on top of me after he fell asleep, he moves around a lot while sleeping.",3

to me this is a foul in public however i just ignored it and put my earbuds in. 

after a while i made a phone call using my earbuds. literally 30 seconds into my call she interrupts me and asks me to quit being rude and talk quietly so she can hear her show.

i was as polite as i could and said that not only herself but everyone for about 10 feet and i could hear her show word for word and that making a phone call isn't rude but watching a show on your device full volume in a public waiting area is actually very rude and that is why people use headphones. 

she said she has every right to enjoy her show without being interrupted by a rude and selfish phone call or having to use headphones. 

i said she was absolutely right and i am completely wrong, please enjoy your show while we  wait for the plane and i will do  the same.       i then proceeded to take out my ipad and open ice cubes good cop bad cop music video and play it full volume on my device without my earbuds.

thank you to everyone pointing out i was an idiot and i should have called the police to make a report.

a long story short i went to station made a report, gave them all the details i had along with showing them a copy of the security camera footage of both incidents that my landlord was kind enough to send to me. thee police officer didn't seem to really care from my impression, but he made a report. no one to my knowledge ever came out or anything. 

anyways today the father, and son came to my door today and he basically apologized for accusing me of lying, and made his son apologize to me (awkward..), and gave me a bag consisting of my clothing. i told him i didn't particularly want to that stuff again, and was going to throw it out (just the idea of keeping it made me disgusted). so the father kindly gave me the cash value for a rough estimate of the items and then some, then told me if stuff goes missing to come to him first.

"aita? my husband and i are getting my stepson a car for his birthday. his mother wants to chip in and say that the car is from all of us, but i don't want to do that.. my stepson is turning 18 soon and my husband and i decided that we will be getting him a car. i make more than my husband does and we will be splitting the cost of the car 70/30. that's fine with me.

his mother is a woman who i make the effort to be civil with but don't like. i am much younger than she and my husband are, and come from a more privileged background; she had a lot of things to say about that. she called me her ex's cash cow and that's one of the better things she said about me. we are not friends and i won't even describe her as nice to me.

when my husband told her that we will buy my stepson a car for his birthday, she said she wants to chip in 5% of the cost and then we could tell my stepson that the gift is from all of his parents and step parents. 

i don't want to do that. i don't need her 5% and my stepson knows that his mom and step dad are not in a position to equally share the cost of buying the car. i don't want recognition for paying 70% of his gift's cost but i don't want to share my and my husband's gift to my stepson with a woman who has always been antagonistic to me.

i don't know why she wants us to gift the car jointly now because we've never given my stepson a gift jointly before. and i don't understand what's so bad about getting separate gifts from me and his dad, and his mom and his stepdad.

i know that many people will say that it's better for my stepson to see that all his parents and step parents are getting along. i'm civil to his mom and i never talk negatively about her to him. is that not enough? am i incapable of being a good step mother to him if i'm not best friends with his mom? do i have to let his mom get her way whenever she asks in the name of all parents getting along?",3

my sister and i have a strained relationship with our mother and have not had contact with her for months. our mother took it upon herself to show up to my niece's school to have lunch with her and brought her a slushy to drink, without my sister's knowledge or permission. my niece told my sister about it when she got home. my sister called the school and come to find out, our mother is not on the list at all for anything. so they allowed a stranger into the school and allowed this person to give a drink to a 5 year old all without my sister's knowledge. 

the principal is calling my sister later and so far they are trying to make it seem like it's not a big deal, we feel differently. the only thing i can think for her to do is maybe call the school board? they risked my niece's safety and i think they need to realize the gravity of the situation but i'm not sure what could be done.

update: my sister called the school board and they assured her that the policy states only approved people from the list should be let in. the board called the school and reiterated the rules and how they should be followed. the school also flagged our mother's name as an extra precaution. thank you to the people who were helpful!",2

"for telling someone that his art sucks and he won't amount to much in life in front of his friends and family.. i have a small group of close friends (all males around the age of 25) that i hang out with almost every day. we've all known each other almost all our lives and recently (~1.5 years) got a new addition to our group, john. 

i never really liked john. he was rude, obnoxious, and would always talk like he knows everything. he was also incredibly pretentious. a friend of mine said ""einstein"" once and john interrupted him to say, ""i have no idea who you are talking about. do you mean the reknown scientist albert einshtein?"". i once put up a snapchat story saying, ""i love college football!"", and he replied to my story with ""it's called gridiron you moron"".  i don't understand how but my friends readily accepted him into our friends circle. 

on one night about 5-6 months ago, we had a little get-together and were just drinking and having fun. john was kind of tipsy. we had some new girls show up so i was kinda working my charm on them. they asked me what i did and i went ""i'm a biomed engineer"". i don't know why that triggered john so much, but he went on this hour long tirade about how i'm just a drone in a rat race. he kept telling me about how i'm just like every other person and lacked creativity. he later passed out, but his little tirade became a running joke in our group.

every time i mention work or anything, john would start roasting me. he nicknamed me 'drone' and kept calling me that even though i expressed multiple times that i dont like to be called a drone. he would keep telling me about how easy engineering is (he watched some intro to engineering courses online) and that any monkey with a brain can do what i do. that really pissed me off. once i told him to shut the fuck up but he was like, ""what are you going to do, fight me? i dare you to swing"". i didn't want to fight him so now i started getting referred to as a 'pussy'. 

over the last few months or so i kinda went frontpage a couple of times on reddit and everyone was like, ""damn m0shka you famous now"" (as a joke). that triggered him even more. he'd say stuff like ""his posts suck. they're not even funny. reddit is now just filled with stupid facebookers who upvote stupid clickbait shit and downvote meaningful talent."" 


at this point it is relevant to bring up what john does. he's a 'photographer' who works as a barista at starbucks. how good is he? honestly, he started off as an annoying kid with a dslr, no talent, and a facebook page where he uploaded 3/10 pictures. over the years he got slightly better but it's still terrible. i'd say he's more of a 5/10 now. 2 weeks ago, he got rejected from his dream job and made an instagram post about how national georgraphy discriminated him because of his skin color (brown). 

last week, we had a surprise birthday party at his place with his family (he lives with his parents) and friends. at the party, i apologized to him (i hadn't met him since the post) and said, ""i'm sorry you didn't get nat geo"". to which he got angry again and said, ""i'd rather eat my own shit than be a drone like you. what i'm doing is making real art and it's something your robot brain won't ever understand now or in the future, so i actually feel sorry for you"". he said stuff like this in front of a girl i was with who got so enraged that she left and told me to tell them that shes sick or something. 

that's it. i fucking lost it. we were handing out mics to talk about our favorite memory with john and i took that opportunity to say, ""well john, your pictures fucking suck, no wonder nat geo rejected you. you're a 27 year old barista with no college degree, mooching off your parents, and taking worse pictures than any jackass with an iphone camera. you're not going to amount to anything in life so just --- *i get cut off here*"" 

his dad grabbed the mic and shoved me. john came charging at me but everyone just held him back. the rest of the guys were like get him out of here, and i got kicked out. no one has talked to me since the incident and john blocked me from all social media. our group chat has been pretty silent too. john also apparently made a roast post about me. idk if i should apologize to him or not. sorry for the long post. i know john is an asshole, but aita?

edit 2: wow rip my inbox. thank you kindly for the golds and even a silver!  im glad this lpt has reached so many people because that means so many people are more aware about the joy of adopting adult dogs from shelters, and it's also been great reading the comments about how people have adopted adult dogs and are so loving in their families.

edit 3: don't forget about cats!

edit last:  man i've loved seeing all the sweet stories of adoption in all the comments. and i've learned a lot from the not so sweet stories as well, they are a great balance to the rose tinted glasses as it were.

"for having a wedding and not disclosing we were already legally married?. about two months ago, my husband and i got ""married"" in a beautiful ceremony. it was so much fun. we went on a honeymoon after. the price tag makes me wheeze, but my parents were insistent on paying for 95% of it, saying it's their only daughter's wedding. as a result, the wedding was way more fancy than something my husband or i could afford! my husband and i paid the rest â his family did not contribute (which is fine!). 

the wedding was lovely, but missing one piece - the marriage license. about a year and a half ago, i was going through some serious health issues (the issues are resolved now, thankfully!). i had recently graduated from school and didn't have health insurance. my husband and i decided to get married so i could join his health insurance. it was a quick justice of the peace ceremony. we were always planning to have a ceremony at some point in the future. a few months after that, he ""proposed"" (something i didn't see coming!), the wedding occurred, and here we are today, planning for kids. 

very few people knew we got legally married about a year and a half ago. we weren't trying to be deceptive. however, part of it was that i wasn't comfortable revealing my health issues. my husband respected this. my parents knew about our legal marriage, but his mother did not. his mom (i'll call her carol) and i aren't close. she's fine enough in low doses, but...

we're currently in the process of moving. this past weekend, his mother came to help us pack up things. as we were packing files (birth certificate, social security cards, etc.), somehow our marriage license must've slipped out. carol picked it up and kept insisting we need to frame it. and then she noticed the date. 

carol lost it. she insisted we lied to everyone. she said our wedding ceremony was just a ""gift grab"" (our wedding website stated that someone's presence was gift enoughâ we still got many generous gifts and we are forever grateful). carol went and called her twin sister, my husband's aunt, and the sister called and lashed out at us. she said we were sneaky and deceptive. she is saying she may want her gift backâsomething we are fine with giving her. 

for me and my husband, the legal wedding was just so i could get insurance. a means to an end. our wedding date is what we will celebrate. are we assholes for not being more upfront? i've been really upset and confused and waffle back and forth. my husband insists we are not assholes.",3
"by starting small talk with a kind little dude on the subway.. yesterday i got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. i squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. i notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where i'm standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. he looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. as a larger human, 6'3"" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn't quite fit me.

though i couldn't let his kindness go unnoticed so i decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. as i sat down i thanked him for making room and told him i really appreciated the gesture. we high-fived and in hindsight i should have ended it there.

i noticed he had his backpack with him so i asked how school was that day. he told me it was just alright. then i asked the fatal question, ""do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?"" he let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.

her eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. she yelled ""oooo boy!! you told me you finished that yesterday! guess who doesn't get to play his video games this weekend?! you, ya little liar!!!"" his head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. 

a few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. he looked back at me as they departed, a look that said ""bro, i thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???"" his look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. 

hang in there little buddy! one weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies!

"by telling my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me. this happened approximately six years ago, i was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that i post it here. 

&#x200b;

so, flashback to undergrad, things are good and i just started dating this beautiful girl that i had met in class. i was enamored with her, shocked that i loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. the first months are amazing, we can't keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. 

&#x200b;

after a few months into our relationship, i started to notice some concerning symptoms. as you can probably hypothesize, when i pee'd, it burned. at first, i just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, i decided to stop taking creatine just in case. but, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. i would literally be struggling to stand while i pee'd because the pain was so intense. after, i would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. it was bad. 

&#x200b;

well, at this point, i was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. no, it had to be what i thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. i hadn't been with anyone else. i hadn't been with anyone else since i began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. i was shocked. things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had i gone wrong? the thought made my blood boil, until i outright confronted her. i told her i knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. she told me no. i demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. she said sure. (looking back at this i feel like a complete dick). we agreed that we would go the next day.

&#x200b;

the same night i confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. she was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. around this time my roommates and i had just moved into a new house. in the process all our belongings got shuffled around. as she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed ""why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!"" i heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, i've been pissing out bleach?!?! i instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. she took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. 

&#x200b;

tl;dr - months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when i pee'd. i told my girlfriend i knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an std test. the night before we went, i inadvertently discovered that i had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap.

"a male friend is a licensed massage therapist and has been working for the same high-end spa for 14 years. he just found out that company policy does not allow minors to receive massages with male therapists.. spa is in maryland. a friend would like to know if this is a discrimination case because his spa does not allow minors to be massaged by male therapists even with parents in the room but it's ok for female therapists to give massages to minors. he is losing out on an income when parents specifically request him for their athletic children but company policy states male therapist cannot treat minors. he has not spoken with management yet. he just found out because a friend requested him but was told her child had to see a female and the parent told him. any suggestions on how to approach management would be appreciated.

edit: policy states that parent must be in the room while minor is being treated by female therapist but they will not even allow a minor to be treated by a male therapist even with the parent present. 

minor update: i advised him of his many options after reading the comments. he went to management (it's a very large salon/spa) and they told him is was an error/misunderstanding on the receptionists part and that they would call the client/mom and schedule an appointment for her son with him. mom is a client of the therapist and will be present during massage. 

i'm guessing that they know they set themselves up for a lawsuit and covered it up by saying it was an error. the mom was specifically told that boys or girls can only be seen by female therapists with a parent in the room. 

thank you everyone for the comments. if this  issue comes up again he will be going over their heads to handle this legally. ",2
"update: i 24f am dating a 25m almost unreasonably picky eater and i'm pretty much at the end of my rope. previous post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/c3ev1n/i_24f_am_dating_a_25m_an_almost_unreasonably/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

this happened last night.

&#x200b;

this update is way more dramatic and unpleasant than i had hoped but it is what it is. i read what you all wrote and i appreciate all the comments left for me. despite a few outlandish ones, they were all very helpful and reaffirming of my beliefs that i'm not being nit picky about this issue. 

i decided to give it one last shot at broaching this issue with him and letting him know how serious it was to me. he needed help and so long as i saw that he was trying that was all i asked for. we were out to dinner (i'm sure you can all guess what we had to eat) when he brought up his trip to germany and how he would have to find a supermarket stat in order to stock up on frozen pizzas to keep his ""streak going."" i was hoping to do it after the trip so as not to ruin his good time but i figured now was as good a time as any: 

me: maybe you don't have to continue to the streak. maybe you can just try new german cuisine without worrying about having to get pizza into your diet the entire time. have you talked with your therapist about your avoidant eating?

j: no way. i have people depending on me to continue this streak. i don't want to let them down.

me: i don't think anybody really cares about this streak as much as you do and frankly, i'm worried about you. this is really unhealthy and it's consuming your life. you're about to go on this incredible trip to germany and the forefront of your mind is to get to a grocery store to pick up frozen pizzas. i think you really need to discuss this with your therapist again.

we had a back and forth the rest of our meal about his diet and how it was affecting our relationship. he doesn't think it's a problem because his health is fine (keep in mind he's only 25) and how i was being a busy body and needed to mind my own business. i let him know how this is my business because it affects me. we can only go out to eat one thing, we can never have a meal at home together, and if we did decide to move forth and have children the example he is setting is awful. 

we let the issue go for the rest of dinner not wanting to escalate it, and ate in silence. the plan after was to go back to his place where i would spend the night. the entire trip home he was silent but very obviously simmering while i wished i had just gone home. i should have gone home. i guess i didn't expect the shitstorm that waited when i got to his place.

he flipped.

he began screaming how he was so sick of me bringing this up and how it was his life and how i couldn't control what he did or ate. i told him i cared about him and his health and wanted him to recognize what he was doing was not healthy. i ultimately agreed that he was right, i couldn't control what he did or what he ate, but he can't expect that i stick around and watch and enable him like i had been doing in the past. 

it escalated from there how he had been there for me the entire time when i was an active alcoholic and through my relapses. i could not and still cannot dispute that. he was. i guess the only difference between him and i is that i wanted to change. i acknowledged the issue and knew i could not go on like this any longer. obviously though, it is much quicker to see the downfall of someone suffering from alcoholism vs someone who is suffering from this kind of eating disorder. one spirals much faster than the other so i was able to recognize it much quicker. 

i told him i was going to leave because i couldn't deal with this anymore. we kept fighting and fighting and he let me know he would ""expose"" me. he has a blog and he told me how he would write one about what it was to live with an alcoholic and use my name. he would be sharing it on facebook. i completely panicked. i cried and begged that he didn't use my most vulnerable moments against me. he told me if i walked out he absolutely would. 

that was all i needed to hear. he was going to blackmail me. i think this snapped me awake to realize this isn't love. if i leave he's going to humiliate me on the internet to get back at me, that absolutely isn't love.

so i left. i don't have many possessions there but he can keep them for all i care. he emailed me a draft of the post (blocked him on everything else) and the subject was ""last chance.""

let him post it. fuck it. i can't control other people i can only control myself and how i react. i deactivated all my social media and i'm ready to move on with my life. it hurts that somebody i trusted so much would explicitly broadcast my past, but it's a learning lesson. thank you all for reading.

"update: my 20 fiance's 27m behavior while online gaming is destroying our relationship. i made this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cu4pbd/my_20_fiances_27m_behavior_while_online_gaming_is/) a few weeks ago as i felt my fiance's behavior around video games had started to spiral out of control. a lot of the comments mentioned red flags like age difference, his other 'vices' like drinking and drugs, the fact that he might get violent with me, etc.. 

i spent a few days thinking about what others had said, and ended up reaching out to my cousin who i am quite close with and telling her a watered-down version of events. she expressed some concern and agreed that i should speak with fiance's brother. fiance continued acting the same (no surprises there)in terms of gaming, with the yelling and late nights. that sunday (several days after posting here) he became very upset because i went out to lunch with a few girls from school and he called me 4 times because he wanted me to pick up a takeout pizza and a case of beers and was upset and yelling at me, accusing me of being selfish because i didn't leave my girls lunch to get them. i got them on the way home and was met with accussations of being selfish and even cheating because i was 'late' and the beer was the wrong kind. i just shut down and went into the bathroom and cried for a while. i knew that something really needed to change.

the next day fiance left for work and i left for school just as usual. i called fiance's brother during my break between school and work and i basically told him that i had noticed some concerning behavior around the video games and that i was worried that it might spiral like the drugs and alcohol had. fiance's brother pretty much agreed and stated he thinks fiance has an 'addictive personality' and might need some kind of professional help for this. then, to my shock, he told me that fiance was *at his house* and asked if i wanted to speak with him. i was extremely taken aback because fiance was meant to be at work. i hung up with fiance's brother and called fiance's workplace. i was extremely nervous and felt like i was doing something sneaky and horrible, but i needed to know what was going on. i spoke with his manager and learned that he had quit his job weeks ago!! he told his manager his dad had a medical emergency and he had to move across the state to take care of him. wtf! so i guess he would just leave the house and fake going to work on the days he said he was working. after work i went home and fiance was gaming. i told him that we needed to talk and he tried to shut me down because he was in the middle of a match. he finally agreed to mute the game so he could hear me. i was literally shaking at this point and told him that i was worried about his gaming destroying the relationship. i said that i was seeing a pattern with the pills, the drinking, and the gaming. i said that i was worried about going through with the marriage when he treats me like a servant and is so disrespectful towards me and our apartment. at this point he unmuted the game and started ignoring me again. so i did something stupid and stood in front of the tv and said that i knew about him quitting his job to game all day. he flipped out. he got violent and pushed me away from the tv. there was a lot of hitting and kicking (hit me with the controller). i got outside and was standing in the wet pavement with socks on for an hour or so as he locked the door behind me. he eventually came and apologized. he offered to get uber eats and watch a movie. i literally felt sick. i locked myself in the bathroom and just cried and looked at my county's domestic violence help page. he literally just kept gaming until i went to sleep.

the next day i couldn't go to school because i had a bad black eye, it was not something i could explain away. i wanted to just disappear. i got on the bus and went to the women's center. my cousin met me there and she was speechless at how bad i looked. i was very adament that i don't want to press charges or anything, i just needed help with the next steps of getting away. the social worker there was so nice and helpful, and didn't judge me at all. she helped me figure out how to get my stuff out of the apartment (cousin's husband and his friend went) and sat with my while i drafted and sent fiance a text stating that i cannot be with or marry someone who treats me this way. he called me nearly 20 times during the time i was at the center. i didn't answer the phone and the social worker encouraged me to block his number. for the short term i am staying with my cousin and her husband and i'm working on finding an apartment. next month i'm meeting with a counselor who treats people who have escaped domestic violence through the center. i still feel hurt, sad, confused, and like i'm living in a nightmare. but for the past week or so i haven't been screamed at, sworn at, or had any of my things broken. i've also gone to bed before 11 every night. someone on here sent me a pm saying that they thought fiance's behavior would escalate to him hurting or even killing me and they were right, so i'm just glad i was able to get away when i did. 

i don't expect this to get a ton of attention but pretty much no one in my real life knows how bad it was and i just wanted to put this out here.",8

"nsw australia. last month a friend began to cross a flooded river in his car with me in it. i jumped out because i'd been caught on a flooded causeway before. i now have a letter from his lawyer asking for damages because the car was washed off the causeway and written off.. long time la reader here, and i'm pretty sure this is a case of my (probably ex) friend being an idiot on a lawyer's letterhead or not telling his lawyer the whole story. when i'm in the middle of it, it feels a lot different though.

early in november we went to pick up car parts after work that my friend i'll call aaron (because his name's aaron and i think he's being an idiot) had bought on ebay. we had to go through some back roads to get to the property and picked it up and all was well.

it'd been raining for part of the day but really picked up when we were loading the parts, and we got to a causeway we'd passed only an hour before but it was now covered in what looked like half a metre of water and we stopped. i'd been navigating and knew we could back up and take another much longer route, even though the highway was just a bit on the other side of the causeway. there was no way i'd go through the water as it looked, but because i'd been caught on a causeway 20 years ago in less water and had my car pushed off into the river i didn't want to risk it. i didn't lose that car but it's one of the scariest moments of my life. i said we had to turn back and could take a different road 10km around but that would take us via a bridge over the same river.

aaron decided to push on and started moving and i panicked and got straight out. it was far more water than i'd had to go through when i near lost my car and life before. i got out well before the water though so i didn't let water in the car btw.

aaron didn't even get halfway across and the water pushed his car off the side, rolled it completely over and it ended upright on the bank 50m downstream. he was extremely lucky not to drown, and i ran down & helped him out. immediately he was aggressive and combative because he said with my weight in the car he'd have made it across. admittedly i'm 130kg+ but his car is a 1650kg commodore wagon with a couple hundred kg of ebay parts in the back so it's not like i'd have made much difference.

we phoned for help and the river went down within an hour and made it across the causeway by foot. we haven't spoken since and he's avoided me in places we usually go. but on friday i received a letter from a lawyer i know is real in our town, but sounds like it was written by my friend. it's asking for $50k for the car and personal damages because i made the car unsafe by getting out. it was a 1997 commodore, maybe worth $1500 on a good day.

i think he's being a dickhead. someone reassure me, it's not up to me to sit in someone's car when they're doing something dumb is it? ideally i'd like to post him this link and responses if they're what i think they'll be. i want to contact his lawyer to tell them aaron is either being an idiot on their letterhead but in the off chance it's for real should i get my own lawyer to draw up my own 'stop this you bunch of goons' letter?

thank you to the many commenters who offered good advice. including to call in advance and  let my parents know how it was going to go down if they wanted a role in this new part of my life. 

went like this. paraphrasing of course. 


me: hey mom and dad, you know i mentioned a girlfriend a few times. we're moving in together so i'm thinking i'll bring her out. 


mom: oh that's nice. first week of december maybe? 


me: sure. look there's one thing though. she's not thin. if you make a comment or so much as look at her weird, we're done, we're going home. i love her. and she would never intentionally make you uncomfortable, so i expect you to show her the same respect. 


mom: but you have so many prospects and a good job why would youâ


me: no. this is exactly what i'm talking about. 


mom: fine. i'm just happy i finally get to meet her. 


dad: *insulting weight related comment*


me: what the fuck dad? 


mom: oh babe give it a rest, it can't be that bad. 


me: no if there's any chance of that sort of commentary, i'll just not come. i have zero tolerance for this. you're going to treat her with the respect she deserves or you won't get the chance to screw it up. 


dad: *insulting joke* 



me: ok, bye. if you wonder why brother is buying a tux for a wedding you've heard nothing about in a year, maybe two, think back to this conversation. 



mom: no, wait, i'll make sure his act is together by the time you're out here. 


dad: *insulting comment* 



me: i'm hanging up. 


so it looks like i'm going to fly my mom out here, not sure when. probably not soon. my girlfriend saw how much stress this was causing me and i started a more in-depth conversation about it and she basically said ""it would be nice if i could meet your parents and we could get along but it sounds like that won't be possible and it definitely isn't worth putting you through this.""

so thanks for the comments and help. for now it's a non issue it turns out.

he follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and
trot across the road to a bus-stop.
the dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench.
when a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus.
the butcher follows, dumbstruck.
as the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery.
after awhile he stands on his back paws to push the ""stop"" bell,
then the butcher follows him off.
the dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step.
he goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door.
he does this again and again. no answer.
so he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window,
jumps off, and waits at the front door.
a big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog.
the butcher runs up and screams at the guy: ""what the hell are you doing?
this dog's a genius!""
the owner responds, ""genius, my ass.........
it's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!""",0

an example of what i'm talking about here is that i used to make my husband a cup of coffee and bring it to him every morning. often he would barely even acknowledge me putting down the coffee much less thank me for it.  at first, this bothered me, how could he not appreciate this nice, loving gesture and getting fresh coffee served to you in the morning?  the answer is that he really doesn't mind making his own coffee and doesn't notice much whether i do it or not. now i don't bother and it's one less thing on my mind in the morning.

i also noticed that i was organizing a lot of light social events at work - birthday lunches, holiday parties, happy hours, etc. people would come but nobody ever really made a point to say  that they appreciated i was doing it. i stopped bothering most of the time and nobody really noticed and it frees up a lot of my time. now i only do it if i feel like having drinks out or giving a friend a lunch party.

"by taking lsd and pretending to be french for 10 months. throwaway for reasons.
tl;dr at the bottom.

so this was more of a fu that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.

about 11 months ago i moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until i could get the money together to sort something out properly, i was hoping to have already moved out by this point. on my second day after i'd finished unpacking i decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, i'd brought some with me that i'd recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.

things were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and i quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than i had been told they were, and i thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn't helping me relax. so i figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because i was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. 

so i left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. it's a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door's door is about one meter away from mine. i'd not met anybody on my street yet and didn't realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. she said something along the lines of ""hello nice to meet you, my name's (her name), are you new to the area?""

so basically i do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where i pretend i can't speak english. i remember a few words from my gcse french so i just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. in the state i was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and french just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. my exact words were ""je voudrais une boulangerie"" (one of my favourite lines to use) and i shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. she pretty much just left me to it after that and i got on my way. i did my walk and got home about two hours later, i was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. when i got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. i tried to keep my head down because i couldn't handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said ""bonjour"", so i instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. when i got in i started freaking out straight away because i realised that i'd just become french and now two of the neighbours think i can't speak any english. the next day when i woke up i realised the best thing i could do (as an englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be french for seemingly no reason. 

fast forward 10 months, i still live here, and at this point i'm in deep. my life on this street is a web of lies. i've perfected my french accent and over the course of 10 months french me has learnt a decent amount of english so he can hold disjointed conversation.
i'd gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and i was the nice quirky french guy on the street. i didn't let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation i had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered i wasn't french. if i had friends come over (i don't have many so it wasn't too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. most of them found it amusing, at least. 

things were going okay and i wasn't too worried about being exposed anymore because i'd gotten so used to it. i'm not home that much and when i am i rarely leave the house for any reason so i only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when i was out on my street. if anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when i got to take on my french persona. french me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his english was a bit limited.

but then there was the day it all came crashing down. i was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her i didn't recognise. she stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend ""this is f7tj78, the guy i was telling you about"". you might be able to see where this is going. 

her friend hits me with a question in french that i didn't understand a word of, and i knew he was actually french straight away because his accent was way better than mine. i didn't know what to do and i just froze. every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause i just decided i had to come clean. i told her i wasn't actually french and couldn't speak french and then i tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke i'd been doing on everyone. nobody was buying that. i fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.

i haven't spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which i'd  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. i make sure nobody is around now whenever i leave the house, and i do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when i get home so that i never come into contact with them. every time i think about the day i was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.

tl;dr: pretended to be french to avoid human interaction on lsd, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a french man.

edit: i didn't think this post was going to catch much attention, and i'm praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. some people seem to have a hard time believing that i thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, i'd like to remind people that when i made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me.",4

5. ""i'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. he even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? you keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. so maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""short and fat isn't a good combination""

and so on. on average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. i've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. it's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",8

"by attempting suicide without realizing it. so, as i was making myself breakfast this morning, i for some reason started wondering what would happen if i touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. being the very intelligent man i am, i of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. i instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. a small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.

the worst part is, i still didn't realize what i had actually just done. i just thought, ""uh huh, whatever"" and put the fork back into the drawer. as i grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that i had almost electrocuted myself. maybe i was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. if i had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, i would have gotten an electric shock.

oof. i was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. i'm not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. especially if you're wearing loose pants. i locked eyes with the passenger next to me. she wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. it had the words ""best mom ever"" on the pillow case. *of course it had*. at that point i realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. i was too embarrassed to really speak, but i managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. she shook her head as if to say ""don't mention it"". and then she said this fucking shit: 

""don't worry, you've said enough in your sleep""

""i'm sorry?""

""i have a son who's also into x-men""

"my gf of 3 years returned the engagement ring because she didn't like where i proposed.. i decided to propose to my gf of three years on our three year anniversary. i flew her to vietnam and after a couple of weeks traveling we ended up in cambodia. she had wanted to see angkor wat and some other temples that were on her bucket list. after a long day of hiking in the heat through ruins we retired back to our hotel and when we were alone together i proposed and she said yes. we kissed and i had planned to take her to the waterfall the next day to celebrate. it's really beautiful. she took a shower and i laid in bed thinking what an amazing day i just had and how i would get to spend the rest of my life with the women i loved. when she came out of the shower however she was in tears. she handed me back the ring saying she couldn't accept it because she didn't want her memory of my proposal to be in a hotel room.

i played it cool and said i understood but truthfully it hurt. it seems to me that i had offered her something of value. a lifelong commitment and partner. i took her halfway around the world and helped her cross off something she had wanted to do most of her adult life. i felt that if she valued me it wouldn't matter that the proposal wasn't exactly what she wanted. it was me and our future together she was saying yes to and not my delivery. if she had found a million dollars in a dumpster she wouldn't throw it back because of where it came from. so she can't possibly value me or what i have to offer as an individual if she's willing to reject it because she didn't like the place i asked. 

i'm preparing to end things when we get back. she wants me to propose again and better and then she'll say yes, but i'm done. am i wrong? should i do it over? what do you think.

"update girlfriend (now ex) is pregnant and wants to give up for adoption. i don't. what are my rights?

short version: i'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!

long version:

if you remember, i asked about how i should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. i listened to the suggestions. got a lawyer. put myself on the registry as well.

she really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. i was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. but in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. so we had no messy legal right over it.

the childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. my lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.

so i have my baby daughter!

taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. i feel like i have something to live for! my family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. i also got a promotion at work. i realized that i need to be more ambitious because i now have a baby to provide for. a higher position was open at my work and i asked for the promotion but they told me i'm too young. i offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that i can do it. after a month they gave me the job! 

as most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), i had my lawyer file for child support after i had full custody. my ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. she actually called me names and various insults and all of that. but i didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. she said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. i don't know. i didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but i think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. i didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, i'm not good at studying) but i want to make sure my daughter has the chance! my sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and i think i'll send most of the child support payments there once i start receiving them.

thank you all. ",2

"tifu- by not knowing about sunblock expiration dates. i applied spf 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. i was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. 

i pretty much had no idea that i had a problem until i scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. i considered for a split second that i had a burn but like an idiot, i rationalized it as ""sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch"". 

the blisters formed by the next day and i started reading the can to see if i missed something about applying it. i found the customer service number and called it. before talking to anyone, i heard a recording tell me that the fda doesn't require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. this bottle was easily 4-5 years old.

i had no clue. 

i went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. 

it was easily one of the most painful things i have ever experienced. except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. i soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. 


this was preventable- sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions.

edit- i want to clear up: i'm naturally, very pale person, i was at high altitude while on and in the water. i do not blame anyone but myself for this. whether expired or i stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. i should have been careful with making sure the things i use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. 
i agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, i just don't blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. 
this isn't a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. 

i'm not planning to sue anyone although i appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. 
i just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! be safe! skin cancer is a real danger.

"the husband leans over and asks his wife. ""do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? we went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and i made love to you.""

yes, she says, ""i remember it well.""

ok, he says, ""how about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?""

""oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.

the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. 

then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. 

the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.

she proceeded to tell me that she had been meditating, praying to my guardian spirits daily, and talking to the ""leaders"". all to to help me ""open my third eye to see the truth and understand i was being used by evil.""during these sessions apparently she finally ""realized the truth"" and saw me for the ""evil spawn i was."" according to her i am a ""evil seed"" and that i not only was brought here to bring evil spirits onto her and her ""good children"". i also infected the womb and corrupted my sister. she told me to send my uncle down and pick up all of my ""worldly possessions"" that were infected and to not come with him or ever contact her or her family again. she ended by telling me that i was never her child and that she hopes ""the universe deals with me"". the last contact i know about was her telling my dad she wants to revoke her parental rights.

at the end of last month they moved to the compound with my 3 step siblings. i moved out to live with my dad and have been in therapy since then. things are still pretty raw right now and i really don't feel like getting into the emotions i feel towards this. but i feel like at least updating this may be a start. thank you everyone who gave advice and sent me kind messages on here offering help. i really do appreciate it :)",2

"by not making the bed and causing my wife's entire family to panic. throwaway because i'm still embarrassed and i don't want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.

for background, i usually make the bed in the mornings, but i didn't yesterday morning because i was running late.

i went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn't feeling well so she stayed home. i got back at around 8:30 and couldn't find her anywhere. i checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and i just couldn't find her. her wallet was there so i figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that's active into the night. i started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn't answering her phone. i called a few of her friends and asked if they'd seen her but none had. i called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. my father in law told me to track her phone, so i went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. i turn on the find my iphone sound and start running through the apartment thinking i should call the cops.

i hear the sound coming from our bedroom so i go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell i'm doing. turns out the small lump that i thought was just a pile of blankets since i didn't make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn't feel well. she sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn't hear me in the apartment.

i had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.

"exwife is going off the deep end. this is in nj, usa. can i do anything here?. i get my daughter every other weekend. she's 9 years old and her mother bought her a cell phone, obviously to keep tabs on my daughter. 

this weekend, we were watching a movie when i got a text from my ex wife asking to speak to my daughter. 

now, i don't attach myself to my phone (unless i'm working) and i got the text about 30 minutes after it came through. 

when i saw it, i told my daughter that her mom wants to speak to her and i also texted my ex, saying that we were watching a movie but that i told our daughter that she wants to talk. 

the movie ended around 9:10 pm and i had my daughter go shower/brush teeth/ go to bed. i told her i'd be up to tuck her in. 

i went into my daughters room at about 9:40 and she was on the phone with her mother. 

he mother was screaming into the phone ""you tell him fuck you! you can say that! i say its ok for you to tell your father fuck you!!""

i took the phone from my daughter and i said to my ex wife that she was acting very inappropriately and that if she has a problem with me she should bring it up with me, not our daughter. 

she yelled at me about not allowing our daughter to use her phone, which isn't true at all. 

i asked her to calm down and to keep in mind the effect her words are having on our daughter. my ex was furious and was breathing heavily, obviously biting her tongue.  

i handed the phone back to my daughter, and said loudly enough for my ex wife to hear ""daddy is going to leave the room now, please don't stay on the phone long, it's way past your bedtime."" (bed time is usually 9:00 but the movie ran over a tiny bit and it was saturday night so i bent the bedtime a bit). 

i had to get my stepson to bed (he's a little bit older, so he can stay up a little longer). 

i walked by my daughters room maybe 10/15 minutes later and she's repeating ""i'm sorry"" into the phone. i fought my instinct to take that phone away because of the torment my daughter was experiencing. 

i walked downstairs to do some chores and distract myself from my anger. 

it wasn't until 10:50 that my daughter came downstairs. she had obviously been crying and was exhausted. 

i sat with her in her room, prayed with her, and tried to talk to her about what happened. she was really upset and wouldn't speak much. i hugged her. my daughter told me there was 11 missed calls from her mother and that her mother said she was just worried about her. 

i'm sick of my limited time with my daughter being questioned. divorce is hard enough on children, and i think my exwife is making it a lot harder on my daughter than it needs to be.

"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house?. so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40Â°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"giving my 17 yr old nephew advice on how to meet women.. a few weeks ago i flew out to fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since i havent seen them in 4 years. the first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. they gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. the conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. the older son ,""alec"", was enjoying thus far his senior year at hs and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. on the other hand is my nephew ""dan"" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. when i pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more ""robust"" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and dan. being the cool uncle i let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. as she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my marine corps days. if he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. but dont go empty handed. i suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. now that i think of it i was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. so the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.
 a few days later it occured to all of us dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. when his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. i however was not buying it. i pulled him aside and got the truth. the boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. he would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. he met a girl and they had been seeing each other. i was happy i could help and could not believe it actually worked. however things went south. 
 a few days after my return to the east coast i received a very emotional call from my sister. she explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a ""have you seen this man"" flier on the door. it was a grainy surveillance photo of dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. the flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. when she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. now dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and i told i am not invited for christmas. poor dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.

tl;dr.  i royally fucked up by telling my 17 year old nephew to meet big girls by hanging out in front of womens plus sized stores with food causing him to be forever grounded and causing  possible restraining orders, as well as me no longer invited to my sisters.",4

"i f25 received a letter from my mother f49 yesterday in the mail. i've never cried harder.. so around a week ago i posted on reddit that i was having issues with my mother. my husband and i took in my best friends two children after she past from cancer. we are now working on adopting them. she has been totally unsupportive and down right mean to my children, husband and myself. so i decided to take a step back from her.

i've been ignoring her phone calls and today get a letter in the mail addressed about a week ago. it broke my heart and i broke down in tears. probably the most i've cried in so long.

it was such a heartbreaking letter. she said that ""i was a worthless space of a human"" and that ""those kids would be better off in foster care then with me"". it was a full page of just insults. the one that really got to me was ""you've never accomplished anything and you've never made me proud"". i broke down that line. throughout my life all i wanted was to make her proud.

i ended up booking an appointment earlier with my therapist just to let these emotions out. i'm glad that the kids nor my husband were home at that time. i talked to him last night and he just let me cry to him. he truly is my rock.

"for dropping the ""we're not having kids, now stop bringing it up"" bomb on my mil?.  my husband and i don't want kids. my mil is big into family in the traditional sense. she has been pushy with us about having kids since we got married. literally the week after we got engaged, she started asking.

my husband has always changed the subject, and has even told her that it's really none of her business. every time we see her, she asks. everything we do is built around the idea of use having kids. 3 years into our marriage, my husband said ""we might not even have kids"" and mil would *not*hear it. at year 4, husband had a vasectomy and i had a tubal.

so this weekend we were all at their home enjoying some bbq and drinks and everything. when i get up to grab a beer, my mil asks me if maybe i should drink water instead, because wink wink nudge nudge, you never know.

i was annoyed by this and said ""there's really no chance.""

mil, all wide-grin, said, ""oh come on! it's time for you two to finally get serious! put down the beer and tell us when we can finally expect you two to finally make your family official!""

i said ""we've been official for about 5 years now, mil,"" and drink the beer. husband laughs with me.

mil gets more annoyed and says ""well, you won't be real (lastnames) until you bless us with babies!""

husband said, ""mom, enough."" mil pushed again. husband repeated.

after about fifteen minutes of the usual comments, i finally snapped and said ""mil, husband got snipped. i had my tubes tied. we're not having kids. you need to stop bringing it up. period.""

well, i thought i started wwiii. she started crying and stormed off. family looked at us with disgust and stormed off to comfort her. we left. party kinda ended. the social media bullshit started shortly after. vague posts, links about how motherhood is a woman's greatest calling, listicles about how unhappy childless women are, etc. some meme about how ""i guess i wasn't a good enough mother and won't be graduating to grandmother."" it's obnoxious to the point that i just muted all of them.

my mil finally called me this morning and told me that she was willing to put this all behind us if husband and i came over and listened to her reasons that we really ""need"" to have kids. i told her no, that we are tired of her pushing this on us, and then she said ""well then, i guess you two aren't prepared to be real (lastname)s. i'd like a refund for what we paid for the wedding."" (it wasn't that much. it was like $400 for the rehearsal dinner.)

"my ex (29m) decided to end things by trickle ghosting me (28f), i was starting to heal until i found out the reasons why he ghosted.. the past several months have been incredibly draining and hard for me. i'm not sure if i'm looking for advice or just a place to vent. 

my ex, 'tom', and i had been together for about 4 years and we were extremely happy together, or so i thought. we had been discussing the possibility of getting married, and even looking for a house for us to move in to (but we were not living together). i was happy, and i thought he was too. we had a lot in common, never fought, we traveled together, my friends liked him, his friends like me, our families got along together, etc, i could go on. 

everything was fine until our last trip together. we went to a destination where i had always wanted to go, but because of cost and distance it seemed like something i'd have to wait longer to do. it was his idea for us to go here, we saved a lot of money and were able to make this 2 week trip. once we got back from this vacation, things started to get weird. 

after we landed (the last time i saw him) he told me he was feeling unwell and sick from the trip and wanted to go home to sleep. i didn't think this was too unusual so we said our goodbyes. i tried texting and calling him the following day to see if he was feeling better and he didn't respond. i started to worry, but he finally sent me a single text saying he was fine but tired about two and half days after our trip ended. from there our communication basically broke down. i can't say he fully ghosted me, because he would occasionally send me a message, and didn't remove me from any social media. from that point i'd try to contact him by calling, texting, sending a message on facebook and he didn't respond. after about 4-6 days of no communication, he would end up sending me a couple of texts and then i wouldn't hear from him for several more days. what hurt even more was this ghosting period overlapped with new years, valentine's day and my birthday - days on which nothing happened and he didn't even wish me a happy whatever. 

i felt like i was going crazy. i had no idea what was going on and just wanted some sort of answer from him.  i was also extremely embarassed to talk to anyone about what was happening. i stopped going out as much, and didn't really see my friends for the 2+ months he was trickle ghosting me. i found myself lying to my friends and family about his whereabouts - telling them he was busy with work, visiting his family, he was sick, or any excuse i could think of whenever i showed up somewhere without him. 

i eventually broke down, i contacted one of his good friends who i felt comfortable with and asked her to meet up with me. i told her that tom had barely spoken to me in the 2+ months, he's only sent me a few text messages and i have no idea what's going on. i told her i didn't know if he was mad at me, if we were broken up or still together, or if there was something else going on that i needed to know about. she looked kinda shocked and confused and told me that tom had told told all of his friends that we had broken up and i that i was taking it really hard, and out of respect for me not to bring it up if anyone saw me. this was soul crushing to hear and i felt humiliated and worthless. i told her this wasn't the case, and that he never verbally confirmed that we were broken up. she said she was extremely angry at him and would talk to him. 

throughout march and april i felt like i was starting to heal some. i felt broken, but i started to pick up the pieces again and began to feel a bit more whole. i told my friends and family the truth about what happened and they were nothing but supportive and helpful. then i found out some additional information about why he ghosted me and what happened on his end. 

he had apparently been cheating on me for awhile. not sure how long, but a little less than a year. i'm also hurt because i know the person he cheated on me with. she's an absolute garbage person. and i'm not saying that as a jaded ex girlfriend. she has always hung around our group but never really been a part of it. i've heard her say some extremely bigoted things about minorities, the lgbt community and non-christians. she is the type of person who is proud to take advantage of government assistance programs, when she doesn't need it. she somehow was able to claim disability, and has bragged about pulling the wool over the government's eyes. i think she was able to somehow use her obesity problem as her disability, i'm really not sure. i can't really confirm any of this, it could be a lot of talk and bullshit on her end. i've always thought you need to be drug tested in order to get some government benefits, and she does a lot of drugs. not only does she take advantage of programs meant for people who can't help themselves, but she is sent a couple of thousand dollars a month from her rich parents, which she also brags about. her parents have paid for her car and i think they pay her rent too, so the money she gets is spent on pretty much whatever she wants. she spends her days getting drunk at the bars and restaurants my friends and i frequent and will interject herself into our outings. she has also tried to sell us hard drugs in the past and usually mentions that any of us are welcome to her place to get high. 

tom apparently started to get high with her at her place, and was originally just trying to hide his drug use because he knew i wouldn't approve. then he started to get high and then have sex with her. he felt guilty and embarrassed about it, but this wasn't enough for him to stop getting high with her. his intentions were to just get high and then leave to go back to his place, but what would usually happen is they would end up having sex once they were both properly high. this woman hated my guts, and kept pushing tom to break up with me so they could be a couple. he didn't want to end things with me, but felt so guilty and disgusted with himself he thought the best thing to do was to just try to ghost me. 

tom kept their relationship secret for awhile, until she got tired of their secret relationship status. so she just started to blurt things out about them when his friends were all together at their usual bar. he came clean to his friends about it, but was so embarassed that he shortly ended things with her after his secret was found out. 

i only found out about this, because the same friend i had met up with a couple of months ago reached out to warn me that tom is going to try to get back together with me and felt that i deserved to know the truth in case he isn't forward with what happened. 

1. there is no way in hell that i'd get back together with tom
2. i can't help but feel like absolute dog shit that tom would end things with me over that kind of garbage person and i'm having a hard time understanding why he would chose some waste of space, over someone who is actually trying to be a person and is successful. 

i don't know what to do at this point. i'm dreading the possibility of seeing his face again. i don't know if i could contain my urge to slap him, or if i would just break down and sob. i was doing well from moving on from him. i was starting to feel happy again. now, i think i'm back at square 1. i'm depressed and stressed out.

"the way i (21f) met my boyfriend (20m) is a bit cringy. how do i tell people when they ask. so i met my boyfriend a year ago. i posted on my cities subreddit that i was lonely, i liked videogames and wanted to meet somebody.

i got about 50 messages all together. one guy responded that he liked fallout new vegas. i love that game so we exchanged messages about the game. i gave him my number and we texted all night. our first phone call was over an hour.

he told me he was also lonely. i mentioned how i wanted a cuddle badly. he offered to cuddle me. we decided to have a cuddle date

we met up the following week. he picked me up from my local cafe and took me to his. we got into bed and cuddled for 3 hours.

that's how we met. i know it sounds a little cringy, but to me it wasn't. people have asked how we met and i've told the truth, though an abbreviated version, and people tend to give me a weird look.  i don't want to lie, but is there a way to say it without it coming across cringy?",8
"reddit mods are the lowest form of human life there is.. mods are basically unpaid mall cops for reddit... except even mall cops know they are a joke.  i think reddit counts on the fact there are enough lonely losers out there who will moderate the site for free in exchange for the illusion of authority.  these are shameful, powerless, and deeply troubled people looking to exert a measure of power anyway they can-- the same kind of people who would become abusive police officers and border agents if they weren't already so monstrously overweight.

edit: i apologize for the bit about mall cops.  they are just trying to make a living.  comparing them to reddit mods is a slur that i regret.

"police took my minor son and questioned him alone for 9 hours and didnt allow us to see him or speak to him. this happened last week, he's only 11. at around 10am my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.

they then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. the biggest issue is no one called us. not the school, not the police no one. we got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1pm).

we called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn't a school issue anymore. we start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who's more level headed just tracked his iphone and seen where he was and we headed there.

we got there at maybe 1:15pm and were completely stonewalled. no one told us anything except he's being investigated for a planned school shooting. which is just insane, he doesn't do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. he spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing nerf guns (this is important later).

we continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. she wasn't able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30pm and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7pm. they did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.

we get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their ""guns"". nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. they never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt ""creepers"" from their minecraft game. they painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.

when they finally let him go some guy in a suit says ""sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. we've concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he's free to go"" that's not verbatim but it's pretty much what he said.

they kept offering him mcdonald's, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. they asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or ""do weird things"" after taking or smoking etc. they kept going through his phone and asking him ""where is this picture taken"" or ""who was there"" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn't let us see or talk to him.

the school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. we can't get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us ""the issue is closed"" and hangup. what the hell do we do?

"by accidentally asking my wife's sister for a three way.. this fuck up mainly involves three people me m32, my wife f27 and her sister f25.

so for context a normal saturday is for my wife and i to drop our kids off at her mothers house and go back to ours for some ""good times"" and maybe a film, games or meal etc.

this week however is ""time of the month"" as she puts it so anything sexual is off. 

so off we go to drop off our kids, when we arrive we are greeted by her mother and by chance her sister who happens to be staying there over the weekend. 

now obviously sisters talk and these two talk a lot so her sister knows what we normally do on our saturdays.

as we are about to leave her sister says ""have fun"" in a cheeky way which i completely don't pick up on.

my brain decides that as my wife and i spent thursday together for valentines and today we are just going to chillout, play some games and watch a film coupled with the fact they don't get to spend much time together anymore it would be a great idea to invight the sister along to chill out.

so straight after the ""have fun"" and without consulting my wife, i say ""you can tag along if you like""

the atmosphere drops like a lead balloon and silence descends upon the scene and i'm still there like...   ""what?"" my brain still not connecting the dots  so i double up the fuck ups by breaking the silence with. ""as you said it will be fun"".

my wife's face turns from confused and embarrassed to that look she gives me when i've done something very very wrong and the sister just looks stunned!

still didn't connect the dots until she explained in the car on the ride home.

i've apologised and explained. i know we will laugh about it later but for now i'm playing lego lotr on my own. 

tl:dr i asked my wife's sister for a three way without realising sisters talk about the things they do.

edit: well this post went nuclear! oh and thanks for the golds kind strangers. 

a couple of things i'd like to address, many of you seem to think its bad we don't spend saturday with our kids. well i work from home 4 days a week and my wife is a stay at home mom. our kids are not yet school age so it's nice for us to have time as a couple on a saturday.

"update: landlord threatening to evict me for having (gay) sex in my apartment. good news!. well, here's my update! and with good news!

so first of all, i just wanted to say: wow. the amount of support i received, both in replies and in pms, was absolutely amazing. everything from fantastic advice to hilarious commentary. the person who said ""sand is a weird name for a guy"" had me in stitches.

that said - i feel like people assumed a much worse picture of my landlord (people telling me to buy cameras, etc). he's a nice enough person, but has some very problematic views. he grew up in rural (arkansas, i think? that or alabama) and came to ma later in life. this was his first time being a landlord, so he still had the idea in his head that it was ""his house"", so to speak. that, coupled with the fact that up till now he'd avoided even talking with people who were openly gay, led to a lot of ignorance.

i know some of you were hoping i'd screw him over for all he's worth, or torment him with daily updates of my gay agenda, but alas, i decided to take the calmer approach, and it seemed to work. 

yesterday i sat down with him, and first laid out the various information that you guys helped me find. everything from sexual orientation being a protected class, treble damages, and the fact that those old laws and 100% completely unenforceable. he realized very quickly that he was in the wrong, and he has fucked up bad. he also admitted that even he didn't know what he defined as ""the sin of homosexuality"", or how he'd enforce the fine. he just kneejerk reacted to the (to him) shocking news. 

we ended up chatting for about 2 hours then, and it started with me dispelling a lot of misconceptions about gays (some of his notions were comically bad - like, if i weren't having the conversation with him i'd think he were a caricature). he's a lot older than me, and his kids recently moved across the country (and he was renting their house for him), so i think he had some notions of being a father figure to me, and thinking he could ""lay down the law"" or ""set me straight"". he seemed genuine, and seemed to be legitimately concerned for me and my soul. i reminded him to hate the sin and not the sinner, and that seemed to resonate with him.

he still doesn't agree with homosexuality or my lifestyle, but he's willing to accept it. he seemed to be earnestly trying, and in my mind that counts for a lot. he agreed to write both me and my boyfriend a letter of apology (which i will be keeping copies of in case this matter comes up again and needs to go to court).

the past few days have been super stressful, but it seems to be resolved. if things go well, i might even potentially renew the lease come september. i'll still be on guard for any shenanigans, but i think i'll leave the issue where it lies for now. if this was all a ruse or him backpedaling, i'll go at him with everything i can in the future - but for now i'm satisfied. i'm truly appreciative of all the people who offered advice and moral (and immoral!) support in the original thread.",2
"as a reaction to butt worms (almost certainly nsfw). this is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.

also: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.

for background: at some point in my childhood, i developed pin-worms. in the interest of science, i must admit that i don't know for certain that i had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70's and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that i had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.

i'm afraid that i don't know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all i remember is that as a young child i walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and i don't remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.

fast forward a decade and a half: i am living on my own. single. re-acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone i am still close to refers to as ""she-who-must-not-be-named"". i don't remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....i had worms. my butt was beyond-normally itchy. sometimes it didn't phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn't be sent away once it arrived. the confirmation came when i showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.

i hoped they would go away. i showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. but every morning, i would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.

i was horrified, but i made an appointment at my local clinic. when i told the nurse over the phone that i thought i had butt-worms, she was \*extremely\* skeptical. she said it was ""highly unlikely"", but they would do tests.

i went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly south-east indian man, reiterated the nurse's skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.

i was already frustrated, but i waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. later i drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before i would get results.

in the meantime, i remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.

i would like to say that as a liberal american male, i wouldn't have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that i did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, i dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what i had done.

now to add: i had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. we had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; i wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and i found ourselves showering. my hand drifted down to my butt-crack and i realized i \*needed\* to share my story with her, despite fears that i would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. so i spurted it out: ""uhm, so yeah, i...uh...think i have butt worms....""

she was so practical about it. she asked to see. i pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.

""see,"" i said, embarrassed. ""worms.""

...

""that's toilet paper"", she replied.

""w...what?""

""yeah,"" she said, nonchalantly"". ""that's toilet paper.""

everything fell into place. about a month ago, when finances got tight, i swapped my normal tp roll with dollar store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after i wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.

my relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . my shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.

tldr: i spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because i bought cheap toilet paper.

"for grounding my daughter because she called my sil a ""slut""?. my daughter (14yo) posted a picture of a family get together on social media. a boy from school recognized her aunt from an adult film and messaged my daughter about it. i believe he sent a video to her as well. before this, she had no idea her aunt was in the industry. it appears that boy spread this around the school and my daughter is being teased for it. i notified the school and they are looking into it and will plan to educate the students about sexism online.

&#x200b;

my husband and i are respectful and non-judgmental of my sil's profession and have tried to teach these values to our children. my daughter is understandably upset and i feel for her, but she is directing all her anger and blame towards her aunt. she unfriended my sil from social media and removed all traces of her from her profiles. she refuses to join us for weekly dinners at my sil house and when they come over, she ignores them and just sits in her room playing minecraft. i tried talking to her about tolerance, shame, and sexism, but it she is dismissive of all of it.

&#x200b;

my sil is hurt from all of this. not only did she have her privacy invaded, but she lost a good relationship with her niece. last weekend, i went upstairs to my daughters room to try and talk to her and get her to join us downstairs. my daughter refused and referred my sil as ""a vapid slut"" and her husband ""a pathetic cuck"" along with other slurs i don't want to repeat.

&#x200b;

i grounded her for three months and took away her internet. my husband definitely thinks that she should be punished for using that language, but that's too much. he also admitted he struggled accepting his sister's career path at first. he thinks she just needs space and will come around eventually because her aunt is family.

&#x200b;

edit: seems like my husband is right and i went too far with the punishment. i just never imagined those hurtful words coming from her mouth. i'm going to scale it back to two or three weeks or something like that. will decide with the husband later. we're definitely concerned for our daughter about what's happening at school and we're looking into therapy.

for clarification, as for my sil's privacy, she didn't consent to have her real name revealed to the world or have her films and her personal information be passed around by 14yo boys.",3
"for telling my gf's daughter she's not my daughter so don't expect me to pay?. me and diomara (12f) have had a rough summer.  she's been more defiant than usual.  i've been dating her mom mara (30f) for 2 years now.  9 moths ago, they moved in with me, maple (33m).  both dio and mara have an on again/off again relationship with dio's dad (dynasis).  he's pretty much never paid child support, comes and goes as he pleases into dio's life.   typical shitty-ass part time dad.  i've tried to fill the dad role in her life, while still understanding boundaries, taking things slow, etc.  

&#x200b;

this summer dynasis decides he wants to be a real dad and takes dio in for a month.  good for him, not my business, and mara agrees.  when dio came back home because school started she was a lot different.  really mean to me, very dismissive.  a few days ago she got caught shoplifting at the mall.  security took her in then called mara, who didn't answer, then called dynasis, who didn't answer, and finally me.  i answered.  they told me i had to pick her up or she'll be handed over to juvenile.  

&#x200b;

i didn't say anything to her while i picked her up.  i apologized to security, apologized to the store.  i even tipped the security guards plus the store employees because its fucked up they had to deal with that.  i assured them dio would be punished appropriately.  

&#x200b;

i'm speaking to her in a strong, affirmative, voice while we're in the car.  not yelling, but in a fatherly tone, i suppose.  i'm telling her how fucked up it is to steal, and how i dont fuck with thieves, and how i absolutely don't voluntarily fuck with any kind of police so i don't appreciate any of this nor will i accept it in my house.  she snaps back that i'm not her dad so don't ever tell her what to do.  from now on, if i wanna tell her something i need to clear it with her real father first.  

&#x200b;

that killed my soul.  for the past year or so, i've treated her as my own daughter.  i've paid for their housing, i've paid for her moms car, her schooling, her food, everything.  her bio dad dropped $100 check off one time in the past year.  the fuckin check bounced so i had to call him up and he brought cash over.  i told mara about all of this.  she was appalled at what dio said, but she never made dio apologize because ""she's not wrong, you're not her dad.""

&#x200b;

a couple of days later dio asks me for some money to pay for her uniform/accessories she needs for a sport she's involved in.  i say go ask your dad.  she scoffs and says her dad doesn't have the money for it, so i have to pay for it.  i tell her...i'm not her dad so don't ever tell me what i have to pay for.  she cried to mara, who tells me i'm not being an adult about the situation.  mind you, i never received an apology or a thanks for our entire previous situation.  mara says dio is a kid and i need to stop acting like a kid too.",3
"wife(f33) and i (m34) decided to try for kids last year. found out i'm completely infertile without surgery. 5 months later she got pregnant.. i literally do not know what to do. this is long, **tl;dr** at bottom.

my wife and i have been married for 3 years, together for 6.  she's always been one of the most amazing people i've ever met. no huge fights, love languages match up, and we're both fairly active people which has been why we've always had a really strong relationship for so long. that's why this is so difficult for me.

we've both been doing pretty well in our careers the last few years.  she's in marketing and i work independently as an it consultant, allowing me to set my own hours and be pretty flexible.  we decided last year that we wanted to start a family, her most likely keeping her job full time and me scaling back to part time.  we've both been anxious but pretty excited to have our own kids.

long story short, i was diagnosed with azoospermia last december.  blockage in the pipes just meant i wasn't actually producing any sperm when ejaculating. it's curable with surgery thankfully, and we finally got it scheduled this july.  she's got a high sex drive as do i, so we've still been very sexually active, but there should've been no way i could have gotten her pregnant.

she missed her period this week.  i couldn't imagine that she might actually be pregnant, right?  the babies are bottled in until they get the blockage out.  she took three tests though, and sure enough they're all positive.

at first i was stunned, because this shouldn't be possible. she's never been unfaithful to me in the past and never given me a reason not to trust her. i'm not the jealous type, but i'm literally stuck.  the doctors said this couldn't happen.  and i can't believe my wife would jeopardize the future we've been so excited for over some fling when we seem to have such a great emotional and physical connection.

my wife's been ecstatic. she's given no indication of any guilt or worry that she may have cheated. she was so excited when she first found out that i didn't express my worries then.  but she left for work and now i feel completely torn.  what if she did cheat?

looking back now there's a few tiny things that didn't seem to be an issue but now have me wracking my brain for clues.  her job often has her taking clients out for dinner and it's not uncommon for her to get back later in the evening. she definitely had a busy last few months, but that's not uncommon for her job. she always wears one of the same two perfumes, but she came back one night smelling completely different.  i remember seeing a text message on her lock screen of just a winky face, a different time, but assumed it was one of her girlfriends.

fuck man i don't know what to do.  i set up an appointment on monday to see if there's any chance it could be mine.  if it is mine and i accuse her of cheating i feel like the world's biggest asshole. but she's coming home in a few hours and i don't know what i'm going to say to her, i can't stop thinking of these small things that may have been her cheating and i just didn't see it.

do i wait until the doctor appointment monday before talking to her, or do bring up these insecurities while she's celebrating the pregnancy? i'm worried i won't be able to hide what's going on.

**tl;dr:  wife and i tried having a baby. my balls are blocked, surgery is in july.  wife got pregnant anyways.  it seems ridiculous to think she cheated, but i was told i shouldn't be able to be fertile until the surgery.  wife is celebrating, i can't stop thinking about small occurrences and what if she's cheating.  seeing doctor on monday to see if it could be mine.  want to wait until monday, but don't think i can hide it.  what do i tell her?**

**edit:**  i should add i've been cheated on before.  our relationship has been pretty healthy, but that old fear is creeping back in now.  i'm not sure how to just wait until the appointment.

**edit** i really hope yall are right that some freak sperm made it past.  my wife's coming home though in an hour and i have to decide if i'm going to put on a happy face until monday or not.

**edit** she texted saying she's going be home late

this is bringing up some old emotional scars i think and is just fucking with me.  i'm usually never this insecure or uncertain about being straightforward.  i think i need to just find some way to bring it up without being accusatory.

"by making my wife think i killed myself. right off the bat i want to say that i am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. this was not a prank gone wrong, or something i did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. burner for reasons.

&#x200b;

this happened a couple of weeks ago. i tripped and sprained my ankle. it's been bothering me enough that i've been taking epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. in addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, i also find it incredibly relaxing. say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, i enjoy a good soak.

&#x200b;

i also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. it's basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...i call them old man spots. they're harmless, and most of the time i don't even notice, but every once in a while...i'll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. additionally it takes foreverrr to get the bleeding to stop...its not like i can elevate my balls, let alone put a band aid on...

&#x200b;

well...on the day in question, i get a text from my wife that she's going to be working late. so, i get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. it's not really important how i did it, but i ended up nicking one of those spots. so, after cursing a reasonable amount, i start the lengthy ritual of holding tp against it and checking every so often to see if it's stopped. even after the bleeding stops i have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...well i finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. i put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...

&#x200b;

 i wasn't asleep but i was really zoned out and relaxed...until i was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. i've never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. it scared the shit out of me, and i jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. i shouted ""honey? what the fuck!""  she didn't answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  it took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting ""jesus christ!"".....i could see what it must look like to her... i had apparently not stopped the bleeding as well as i thought i had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.

&#x200b;

it took me a long time to calm her down, and i don't think that's something you just get over. hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won't be any time soon.

&#x200b;

tl;dr - nicked my nuts, didn't stop the bleeding completely even though i thought i had. took a bath, zoned out. wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact i was bleeding into the water and thought that i had killed myself. sorry honey.

i asked, and nope. the words of my father was ""be a man"" k dad. 

so i started working 40 hours a week and going to uni. long story short i failed some classes.

"update my ex girlfriend committed suicide.. i am a firefighter and had to find her body. its been a bit over 6 months since i posted that story and i want to give you a quick update on my life. im on mobile so i apologize if it makes it harder to read. 

 tl;dr my ex girlfriend got into an abusive relationship with a drug addict. she was dealing with depression for a while and killed herself. i am a firefighter in nj, but go to school in nh. i received the call and conducted research to find her. i drove back down to help with the search. we found her body in the woods and she wrote me a suicide note. 


where i left off was me upset about the situation and upset with the world, and most importantly, upset with myself. i was in a dark place for a while after that. i drank and shunned out everyone but my friends who were helping me. for a good amount of time i distanced myself from any girl who i met.

the funeral wasnt long after and jim didnt even show up. im not sure if he was invited, but it just shows the type of guy he is. 


i didnt feel comfortable with dating anyone, let alone even hooking up with them. it felt wrong and i was scared i would get close to someone and lose them again. the depression i felt was destructive.

my chief reached out to me not long after because i never told him how i knew her. he asked me to see a therapist and that he can set up a visit at the firehouse. i was in nh so i told him ill see my college counseling center and send him confirmation. 

i lied, i sent him a fake email and he believed me. i had this notion that i dont need help because i help people. 

after 3 months i was still depressed but i started to talk to girls again. i met this really nice girl named sarah. we talked  and even hooked up a couple times. after a month and a half she asked if we could start dating. i told her i couldnt. i told her my story and said i dont feel comfortable being close with anyone. she took it well and still wanted to talk, but i couldnt anymore. i felt as if she crossed a line in my mind and we couldnt go back. i didnt want to be close with anyone like that again.

fast forward another month my friend kelsey asked if i wanted to go to her sorority formal with one of her friends. i accepted and thats when i met kristen. kristen was perfect, she was really sweet and a great date. we ended up talking for a while and this time i decided it was time to be proactive. i opened up to her about what happened to me and i told her i want to take it very slow. she completely understood, instead of scaring her off she helped me more than anyone has ever had.

she convinced me that avoiding therapy is a bad move, and that there is no shame in seeking counseling. so i made an appointment and went. the therapist told me about a suicide prevention org on campus that i should join and tell my story. i joined them and they had suicide prevention events where people tell their stories  to help others. 

i did my first story and kristen and a bunch of my friends went to support me. it was one of the most touching moments of my life standing up on that stage and seeing all those people. i continued doing these events and kristen went to every single one. 

after 6 months i told her im ready to start dating, but to understand that i may be distant at first because im not use to this. she understood. weve been together for 8 months and shes amazing. shes nicest and most supportive person ive ever met. 

every time im in nj i go to lydias house and support her mom. on christmas i got a crew to come to her house and deliver presents to her moms boyfriends autistic son and her nephews. 

the way i was able to get relief for my pain was helping others. and if it wasnt for kristen i wouldnt have the guidance to do it.",8

"new york- mom and step dad died in car accident while in foreign country, while i was babysitting 4 year old step sister. hi folks

i'm a 21 year old college student. my parents separated soon after i was born, and my my mom raised me alone until i was 15. she met my step dad, a great guy, and they soon got married and had a daughter, my little sister eliza. she's grown up with me, and i often baby sit for her for short periods of time. i live with a roomate in apartments owned by the college

late last week, my stepfather's mom died. he's polish, so my mom and he left for poland leaving me to babysit eliza for a week. yesterday, i got a call from my stepfather's sister saying that both of them had died in a car accident in poland. i've tried frantically to call them, stupidly hoping that somebody was pranking me, but it's starting to sink in that this is real

i have no idea what to do. my biological dad was never really in my life, and my grandparents are dead. my mom was an only child, and my stepfather has no relatives in the usa that i am aware of. i'm studying political science (and was hoping to apply to law school one day), but i have no job and no salary. 

eliza has no family other than me that i can turn to. i'm not ready to take of a child, but i also refuse to abandon her to forster care or adoption-she's my little sister, and i've been around her since my mom was pregnant and am very fond of her. but we also look very different- my dad is jamaican, while my mom and stepdad are white. so i'm a tall, mixed race dude while eliza is a small blonde girl (i bring this up because i was once accused of kidnapping her while grocery shopping, and that didn't get sorted out till my mom showed up).

so what do i do? i'm barely keeping it together from an emotional perspective, and i haven't even told eliza yet. it just hit me that we're now alone, and i now have to step up to the plate and take care of eliza. i have no idea if my mom had a will, or a lawyer, or what to do next

edit: thank you for all you advice. i apologize if i do not respond to your post- got a lot to deal with right now

edit 2: thank you to everybody who has offered to send me financial support. however, i am currently ok, and my mom's friends, and my college friends have kindly offered to help me out, and i also have a little bit saved up. but i greatly appreciate your generosity",2

"(update) nebraska i just closed on a new house, sellers allege that i owe a portion of their 990$ security system cancellation fee because i did not take over their contract. threatening small claims court.. https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9h80ot/nebraska_i_just_closed_on_a_new_house_sellers/?ref=share&ref_source=link

thank you to all of the people who commented on the original thread. this was my first time dealing with small claims court and all of the helpful advice and information really helped set me up for success.


so, short story is that the sellers did end up taking me to court for roughly $1,400. this was for the total cost of the contract buy out for their security system, travel expenses since they moved out of state and would need to pay for gas and lodging to come back to sue us, as well as court costs. 


small claims court was surprisingly straight forward and informal. i've never been a big talker, but i honestly don't think i was able to say more than three words at a time without the plaintiff interrupting me. the judge eventually asked her to please stand in the hall way so i could speak my side fully. she absolutely refused to leave, but did stay quiet for a short minute so i could say that i never agreed to take over her security contract, and there was no documentation to suggest that i did.


the judge agreed and ended up ruling in my favor. i thought it was done there but the plaintiff swiftly appealed the decision. so now we had a new court date early this month with a different judge. 


during this time the plaintiff continues to send me hostile emails and voice messages. the seller's broker (their realtors boss) called me while i was at work to tell me he was very displeased i filed a formal complaint against his realtor. he told me i was not welcome to pursue any future business with his company, and i assured him the feeling was mutual. the broker said he supports all of his realtors and will not be acting on the complaint in any way. so i went and talked to the mayor's office about the situation. the mayor asked me what i wanted out of this, and i showed him the hostile emails from the seller and told him i felt it was the realtor's job to act as an in-between, even after the sell was complete. the mayor said he would step in and speak with the broker. (this is a fairly small town, they probably already knew each other). 


i never heard from the seller again after that, thanks mayor. so now it comes time for round 2 in small claims court. the new judge goes through and reads the write up from round 1 and asked the plaintiff if there is new evidence or information that has not been covered. long story short, there was not. the judge ended up sustaining the previous ruling in my favor, and strongly advised the plaintiff not to appeal unless there is new evidence or information that has not been seen by the court.


it's been five days and no word on an appeal so i think it's safe to say i'm finally done and ready to put this whole ugly thing behind me. once again thank you to all of you who helped me on the original thread. i'm very pleased that resources like this community exist.


on a final note, gossip, but i got a call from the mayor at 2am the night before last because there was a house fire down the street from me. (the mayor and i know each other well). so i went to go help the volunteer fire brigade put it out. we got it under control and we were winding down when a deputy from the sheriff's office comes to tell me that the lady who sued me waited around the court building the day of the appeal for the judge to get off, then tried to confront him about the ruling in the courthouse parking lot. i didn't really care to hear about it, but it sounds like she's in some pretty deep shit now. kind of cathartic.


tl;dr: they lost and i think it's finally over.

edit: thank you for all of the very kind and thoughtful messages! to clarify some common questions, the ruling stipulated that the plaintiff pays all court costs, including my own. yes, i could probably countersue, but i'm very interested in dealing with the seller and broker as little as possible for the rest of my life. :)

"for calling my body-positive co-worker ""unhealthy, deluded, and bitter"" after some rude comments she made about me?. i'm currently working part-time at a restaurant on my university's campus. i mostly work shifts with this one girl, we'll call her 'anna', who is all for the body-positivity movement. she embraces her body type and regularly posts inspiring quotes or images on her social media accounts. personally, i have nothing against this at all. i am also in full support of treating and accepting everyone no matter their body type. however, i do believe that everyone should be healthy (eating right, exercising, taking care of their mental health, etc) or at least attempting to be. i don't support those who use the body positivity movement to as a cloak to shield and justify their unhealthy and damaging behaviors.  

however, despite being a ""supporter,"" anna regularly comments on my body type. for example, i always bring food for my shifts since i personally think the food there is not the healthiest (burgers, fries, more fried food, etc.). anna will often say things like, ""you should eat a burger, you could use a few extra pounds honey!"" or ""you look skinnier than last week. i told you to stop eating salads everyday haha."" she'll sometimes even feign concern for me and ask me in private if i was ""struggling with my weight"" and then proceed to tell me that i look ""way too skinny to be healthy."" one time i was changing into my work shirt in the back and anna saw my stomach and commented that my stomach was starting to ""look like a man's."" i have no idea what that even means but i doubt it was a compliment.

these hypocritical comments have pissed me off. i enjoy eating healthy and cooking my own meals and i enjoy working out and staying toned. anna on the other hand gorges herself on the food in our restaurant, drinks about three cans of coke per shift and does not work out. i don't think this is healthy. 

finally, during yesterday's shift, this guy i kinda like came in to get some food and i was super excited to see him. he turned out to be a bit cold towards me and the whole event was a bit anti-climactic. oh well. anna witnessed the whole thing and  after he left, she said, ""maybe he's into curvier girls."" i basically blew up at her and called her out for all of her hypocrisy. i asked how she could call herself a supporter of body positivity when she regularly shamed my body. then i told her that she was unhealthy in many ways (i called her out on her eating habits), bitter and jealous of others who are in control of their health and bodies, and deluded for believing that she is healthy and fit. 

she called me insecure and told me i was being a rude bitch. it was reaching the end of our shift so i clocked out early and left so i didn't have to argue with her more. i was mad for a bit and told one of my best friends. she said that i was right and all but that i was insensitive in the way i brought it up and suggested that i apologize. i'm standing my ground but want to hear other opinions as well.",3
"i(21) found out my whole family was going on a vacation when i was told to look after the family pet.. my siblings have yet to move out of from our childhood home and i've been of to uni. 

i am so empty and it feels so godamn horrible. i've been trying to act like i didn't care but when they were driving to the airport i couldn't stop crying. my mother was so hurt and they kept saying they loved me. last time we went to a family vacation was when i was around 13. i cried so much i had cramps in my abdomen.

i wrote them a message trying to make them understand what i was feeling and that it hurt me alot. i got back that i was ruining the vacation and to just accept it. they said they thought i wanted to be ""free"". i know it might have been an asshole move to mention this at the first day of their vacation, but the pictures they sent being all happy made all my emotions i've tried to hide come through. i've never felt this left out and i feel like i'm not a family member. i'm trapped in this house taking care of an animal when they are out being a family on holliday.
i feel heartbroken.

my plan right now is to leave the pet with a relative and go back to uni and dive into school to forget.

how can i forgive them? has this happened to anyone else?

edit: 



i would have paid for myself. this is not about getting a free vacation, this about them going away on a family vacation without inviting me. they brought with them my 19 year old brother who even complained that he'd rather play games at home. they are all there. the whole family. they brought my brother so that it would be a family trip. i would not have batted an eye if only my sister went. 

i am really grateful for everyone who commented and gave me a nuanced perspective. i've come to the conclusion that my emotions are valid and that i need to communicate this to my family peacefully. 

i'm also really sorry that so many other people have gone through similar situations and i send all the hugs in the world to you! the feeling of being left out is so so fucking awful.




edit 30 juli: 

i just wanted to say that i've been thinking and given the number of people who commented that ""being an adult means that you are not invited to family trips"" i believe this is where the miscommunication might have happened. my mother probably did not consider to ask me because she had the opinion that adult children have their own families and that i wouldn't be hurt if they didn't ask me. 

for anyone who reads this and have children please do not do this. going of to college does not mean that we suddenly don't need you. being away from family is hard and i missed mine alot. being invited to a family vacation is an excellent opportunity to spend much needed time together. please include everyone, you don't lose a family when you gain another.",8

"i (26f) am an escort and i am falling in love with one of my clients (39m). if you are going to pass judgment on my profession please dont, if you are going to tell me i am being exploited please don't i am not here for that.

&#x200b;

i took on this client about a year ago. i was immediately struck with how handsome he was. as i got to know him he showed himself to be a kind, sweet, charismatic, utterly brilliant person. he is always gentle i never had to enforce any boundaries with him. over the last year i have come to look forward to visits with him above any of my other clients. if there's a scheduling conflict i will give him the priority, lately i have been more intimate with him then my other clients, cuddles, kissing, hugs, and other things i dont do with my other clients. i love my overnights with him. we have long deep talks about everything we have a lot of shared interests and we just get along really well. i feel very safe with him.

&#x200b;

i am falling in love with him. its never happened to me before. i have always kept emotion separate from my work but i cant help it with him. i will spend time with him i dont bill him for, i spend extra time with him and just love to be with him. i've been spending time with him casually, going on... dates i guess for lack of better word that i'm not billing for either and the lines are starting to become very blurry.  i dont know what to do. i think i want to move the relationship from professional to personal, truth is it's already becoming personal to me, but i cant imagine he would be ok with my work if i was his gf. i am afraid of being rejected by him and ruining our work relationship, i think i would give this up to be with him but that presents a whole new set of problems for me in finding a new career.

&#x200b;

i dont know what to do. do i go for it? risk rejection and ruining our professional relationship? do i give up my career for him if he says yes? i dont think i could continue this if i was with him personally. do i just keep silent and continue our relationship as is? or do i drop him as a client altogether? i was never looking for a guy to ""save me"" but i cant help what i'm feeling for him.

&#x200b;

\*edit\*i know why hes single. his wife died in an accident 3 years ago.

edit2 i cant believe how many responses this post has gotten. i am going for it. i'll tell him this week. now to figure out how. lots had asked if i have a back up i do.

edit 3 i'm about to leave for lunch with him. i'm not going to bring it up yet but i do intend to ask him if he ever sees himself getting married again. thanks for all the support. i didn't expect to see this much support.

edit 4 lunch was nice. we had a good time. i did ask him if he felt like he could ever be married again. he said 3 years ago the answer would be a hard no but now he wasn't so sure. then he asked me if i ever saw myself getting married and i had a similar answer, i told him i asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my place tonight, not work, personal. he said he's like that. i'm going for it.

final update 

well i truly didn't expect this post to get the reception it did. i didn't think this many people would care and become so invested in my story. i really didn't expect all the support i got. i was flooded with comments, pms and chat requests. some were about what i expected. accusations of gold digger, and ""cant turn a hoe into a housewife"" type comments thats really the response i expected. what i didn't expect were the thousands of comments and messages of support. you were all right in that i did know what i really wanted. i did know what my heart was telling me but seeing thousands of people tell me to go for it was the push i needed to not waste anymore time. shoot your shot right?

&#x200b;

i'd like to address a few things before i get into the update

&#x200b;

a few people mentioned the story about his wife might be fake and he's secretly married. i was pretty sure he wasn't married i did out-calls to his home and my married clients never take me to their home always a hotel. but i was regularly in his home, i saw the pictures of her around the house i know she was real. 

&#x200b;

how can i trust a guy who uses escorts? well this is a silly thing to judge him on considering what i do. i cant imagine judging a man for using my service. i was his first too and unless hes a good actor i know the awkwardness of a first timer and he was definitely awkward when we first met. i never asked him if he started seeing other escorts because frankly its none of my business. 

&#x200b;

i should wait for him to approach me. unfortunately this probably wouldn't work. as the lines became blurred i did tell him about a few clients who became overly possessive, obsessive and jealous i had to drop. i am sure he thought the same would happen to him if he tried to tell me he wanted a personal relationship. i had to be the one to make this move

&#x200b;

do i want to do this forever/do i really want to give it up? different variations on this theme of leaving the biz. some in favor some against. bottom line is i don't think i see myself doing this into my 30's. it used to be fun and exciting but lately it hasnt been. it just feels like work now and the only meets i look forward to anymore are the ones with him. i also don't feel good about the idea of being committed to him but still seeing clients. i heard from a lot of other sex workers and clients who were able to make that arrangement work but i just cant. even if he would be ok with it i just cant. another add on to this is a friend of mine who has never been crazy about what i do. shes given me a standing offer to go to work with her company on the sales team.

&#x200b;

a lot of people suggested we try going out as friends and doing things outside our ""working"" relationship. i imagine my comments answering this one were buried in the flood of comments so i'll put it here. we have been. for some time now. we meet for lunches, dinners, we go to the movies and make little trips to sites around where we live. we also text throughout the week. 

&#x200b;

ok on to the update. i think i left off yesterday that we had met for lunch. this was sort of a normal thing for us lately and we had a nice chat. i posed to him the question of if he ever saw himself falling in love and marrying again. he said after his wife died he didn't think it would be possible but now he thinks he might be able to with the right person. then he followed up with a question about if i would ever think about leaving the biz and getting married. and i sorta answered the same, with the right person, followed by a pointed stare. he had to go back to work by this point and i invited him to my home for dinner. this was a first. he has never been to my home. i dont bring clients back there only friends. i hoped that sent a strong signal to him. 

&#x200b;

i went back home and started getting ready, i had to go shopping for some things and get the place ready to have a guest over. i called my friend up she knows about this guy and has been on the same page as reddit pushing me to make a move and settle down into something more ""normal"" i told her about the reddit post and said i was making the jump. i also let her know i wanted to take her up on her offer. i called up my upcoming appointments and canceled. i said something had come up and i wouldn't be available. i'm out. i'm done regardless of what happened with him if i cant get my head in the game anymore and i'm getting too personal, plus now i am realizing i want to be in a relationship and i cant separate sex from my feelings like i thought, its time to call it. this isn't what i want anymore. this choice was for me not him. even if things didn't work out with him i realized i really did want to be in a committed relationship with someone. one thing that people mentioned was the idea that he could turn violent when i told him. i honestly didn't believe he would but i asked my friend to call and check on me just in case. she knows the drill we have safe and emergency words set up and we have a plan for if she gets no response from me at all.

&#x200b;

i got my shopping done and got dinner going, set the place up nice and romantic, and got myself dolled up nice and sexy and got ready to have him over. he came by at around 7. he had flowers for me and a bottle of wine. i invited him. he said he wasn't sure if he should bring payment or not and just did. i told him that wasn't necessary he wasn't here as a client. i dont bring clients to my home. i was really hoping he was getting the hint. dinner was going nicely we had our usual rapport but i could tell he was a little perplexed about what this was all about. so i put on my big girl panties gathered my courage, and ""shoot my shot"" as you all put it. i told him i was dropping him as a client. he looked surprised and hurt, he wanted to know why? what did he do wrong? did something happen. i assured him it want about him. i was leaving the biz and dropped all my clients. i told him about the job i took and he wished me good luck, he said i was attractive and charming and he was sure i would do well in sales. he said he was going to miss me. i took a big deep breath and said. ""you dont have to miss me if you dont want to"" and then i spilled it. he was the only client i brought home to tell in person. i laid it all out all the things i mentioned in the post. how i felt about him and how i didnt want to be his escort anymore. i wanted to be his girlfriend. i said i understand he paid me to leave and not stick around and now i was asking to stick around and i would understand if he didnt want to continue on. he said who told you that? that he paid me to keep coming back not to leave. he said he felt it too but he wasn't sure if it was appropriate to ask me that. he was still hurt over his wife and that he wasnt even sure if he was ready but that some of the best things in his life he started when he wasn't sure if he was ready. he asked me if i was ok with being with someone who was still hurting over his ex. i told him i could work with it and that i wasn't trying to replace her. we kissed. i led him into my bedroom and we made love. 

&#x200b;

we spent some time after in each others arms talking about what comes next. he offered to help me make the transition but i told him i wanted to try and do this on my own and not rely on him. i appreciated his offer and if i needed the help i would ask but i need to do try on my own at first. he respected that. i told him that things would change now. as his gf i would have expectations of him i never had as an escort. he was ok with that. i told him i never asked or cared if he saw other women before but now i wanted monogamy i would give it and i wanted it in return so if he was seeing other escorts that would have to end and i reminded him i dropped my clients. he said that wasn't a problem. i was the only one. he spent the night with me and left this morning.

 

&#x200b;

where is this going to lead us next? i have no idea. maybe i am making a huge mistake, maybe this was fate, maybe this was god working in mysterious ways maybe we're just two lost and lonely souls tossed around by the stormy seas of life that managed to find each other and cling to each other. fate, fairy tale or fluke we are going to see where this leads us next, and we're doing it together. i'm excited, elated and terrified all at once. my whole life has drastically changed in just a day. i didn't intend to move this fast but once this train started rolling it seemed like there was no stopping it. 

&#x200b;

to everyone who said i was a worthless whore who could never be loved, fuck you too, to everyone who expressed concern thank you, maybe this is a mistake but i have to find out, to everyone who encouraged me to go for it thank you, you were right, without the thousands of responses to go for it i would have languished in that limbo for a lot longer. 

&#x200b;

as a final thought i want to say that this isn't normal. if you see sex workers please dont see think this is the norm and that the women you see may also fall in love with you. while i'm sure it happens and ive heard from others who were in similar positions to mine its really not the norm. if you're considering sex work because you think you can find prince charming know this outcome is very unusual. oh and i hated pretty woman btw. i never thought it would be me one day.

"for insisting if i can't have my partner over, neither can anyone else?. throwaway bc flatmates have reddit. 

so i 20m live in a flat with 3 other people; childhood best friend 23f, a guy from my uni course 20m and his cousin 26f. for the most part we get along really well and rarely have disagreements. however this has been a real point of contention lately. 

about six months ago i began a relationship with a guy i've known for a couple of years 21m. i know it's still a fairly new relationship but i really like him, he makes me really happy and we're pretty serious about each other. up until recently, he would come visit me at my flat 3-4 times a week. this was mostly due to the fact that i have chronic fatigue and going on ""proper"" dates can be really challenging for me. instead of going out to dinner or a film or whatever, we'd just chill in my room or the living room, watch tv and get takeout or cook together. i didn't really consult anyone about this becsuse a) all the other flatmates have their partners over as often if not moreso and b) he rarely spends the night and usually leaves before 10pm because of his work schedule. 

so the issue: two weeks ago 26f comes to me and tells me that i need to stop having my boyfriend over because it's ""starting to get annoying"". i asked her why and she said it's irritating to have someone who doesn't live there ""skulking around all the time"". i pointed out that her boyfriend sleeps over three nights a week and thus is here more often than mine and she claimed that was different because they've been together for 11 years and are moving in together once her lease is up. she said she's discussed it with the other flatmates and they've all agreed he needs to stop coming over or he has to chip in to the rent because it's ""getting ridiculous"". note: nobody else's partner chips in on the rent. i confirmed with the other two that yes, this is an agreement they've made, though my best friend said 26f basically made her agree by threatening to cut off the wifi and utilities, which are in her name, if she didn't. i asked if this rule applies to everyone but apparently it's just me. i pointed out that it's unfair and was basically told to deal with it.

my potential assholery: i've begun loudly insisting that if my partner isn't allowed to come over, neither is anybody else's.  if i answer the door to anyone's partner i'll send them away. if i come home and someone's partner is there i'll make a point to mention that i thought we weren't having partners who don't pay rent over any more. i've asked 26f's boyfriend over and over how much rent he's paying and pretend to be affronted and make a fuss when he says he doesn't. everyone's pretty pissed at me and is telling me i'm being unreasonable. i know i'm being petty, but i think it's unreasonable that there's one rule for me and another for everyone else and i'm trying to make that point. am i really the asshole here?

eta: some questions people keep asking: 
1. if i knew of something my boyfriend was doing to be annoying/if anyone had told me that he was doing something i'd have included it. i'm not aware of anything he does and when i ask why 26f doesn't like him i just get a shrug and ""just do"". i will also state i'm bi, and she's never had an issue with any female partners i've had. 
2. we don't hang out in the living room much. we literally only use it if there's something we want to watch that i can't get on my bedroom tv and there's nobody else in there. we use the kitchen more often than the living room, but honestly even that isn't that often (we eat far too much takeout pizza rip) 
3. a lot of people seem confused so just clearing up who's who in the situation: the one who brought all this up is 26f, *not* my best friend. my best friend is 23f. not to get too much into a tangent, but basically just over a year ago i was moving out of halls at university and 23f was looking for a new place so we decided to move in together. at the same time, a dude from my course - 20m - was looking for a flatshare. we couldn't find a 3 bed but found a really nice 4 bed and he mentioned his cousin - 26f - was also looking for somewhere to live so she got on board too. i only met her last year and we don't really know each other very well.
4. by chronic fatigue i mean chronic fatigue syndrome sorry that's apparently so unclear.",3
"i don't care about school shootings, and neither should you.. using my backup account for this opinion because why the fuck wouldn't i? if i contended this in public, i'd get mowed down by angry reprimands and disappointed looks. but from an objective and statistical standpoint, it's nonsensical to give a flying fuck about school shootings. here's why.

&#x200b;

**1,153.** that's how many people have been killed in school shootings since 1965, per the washington post.(https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mass-shootings-in-america/?utm_term=.094b0180ee3a) this averages out to approximately **23 deaths per year** attributable to school shootings. below are some other contributing causes of death, measured in annual confirmed cases.

1. **68 - terrorism.** let's compare school shootings to my favorite source of wildly disproportionate panic: terrorism. notorious for being emphatically overblown after 2001, terrorism claimed 68 deaths on united states soil in 2016. this is **three times as many** deaths as school shootings. source(https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death)
2. **3,885 - falling.** whether it be falling from a cliff, ladder, stairs, or building (unintentionally), falls claimed 3,885 us lives in 2011. the amount of fucks i give about these preventable deaths are equivalent to moons orbiting around mercury. so why, considering a framework of logic and objectivity, should my newsfeed be dominated by events which claim **169 times less** lives than falling?   source(https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/06/deaths-mortality-rates-cause-death-2011)
3. **80,058 - diabetes.** if you were to analyze relative media exposure of diabetes against school shootings, the latter would dominate by a considerable margin. yet, despite diabetes claiming 80,000 more lives annually (**3480 : 1 ratio**), mainstream media remains fixated on overblowing the severity of school shootings. source(https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/2017/019.pdf)

&#x200b;

and, just for fun, here's some wildly unlikely shit that's **more likely to kill you** than being shot up in a school.

* **airplane/spacecraft crash** \- 26 deaths
* **drowning in the bathtub** \- 29 deaths
* **getting struck by a projectile** \- 33 deaths
* **pedestrian getting nailed by a lorry** \- 41 deaths
* **accidentally strangling yourself -** 116 deaths

&#x200b;

now, here's a new york times article(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/20/us/school-shootings-drills-risks.html) titled ""*new reality for high school students: calculating the risk of getting shot.*"" complete with a picture of an injured student, this article insinuates that school shootings are common enough to warrant serious consideration. why else would you need to calculate the risk of it occurring? what it conveniently leaves out, however, is the following (excerpt from the washington post:(https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/school-shootings-are-extraordinarily-rare-why-is-fear-of-them-driving-policy/2018/03/08/f4ead9f2-2247-11e8-94da-ebf9d112159c_story.html?utm_term=.c7e601c50733))

>that means the statistical likelihood of any given public school student being killedÂ by a gun, in school, on any given day since 1999 was **roughlyÂ 1 in 614,000,000**. and since the 1990s, shootings at schools have been getting less common. the chance of a childÂ being shot and killed in a public school is extraordinarily low.

&#x200b;

in percentages, the probability of a randomly-selected student getting shot tomorrow is 0.00000000016%. it's a number so remarkably small that every calculator i tried automatically expresses it in scientific notation. thus the probability of a child getting murdered at school is, by all means and measures, inconsequential. there is absolutely no reason for me or you to give a flying shit about inconsequential things, let alone national and global media.",6
"if i told a close family friend that her husband cheated on her 4 years ago?. so my situation is a little difficult so i thought i would confide in the good professional people of reddit. couple days ago me and my brother we're hanging out late night doing regular guy things drinking, watching sports, etc. we haven't seen each other in maybe 5-6 years so naturally we started talking about life and what's been going on the past few years. towards the end of our conversation we started to get to the ""secrets"" i mentioned something along the lines that i smoked weed for the first time and did various other substances (this was hard for me to tell because my whole life i was pretty much anti-drugs and such.) we both laughed about it saying ""just don't let mom find out"" the joke died out after a little bit and then he just blurted out ""i cheated on my wife..."" at first it didn't register until i saw his face and he was dead serious. i for one hate cheaters, but i try to do my best not to judge anyone for their actions. he begins explaining this was something that happened about 4 years ago when his wife was always busy with work. she would travel a lot and be away for weeks at a time. he told me they were going through a tough time back then lots of arguing, not communicating, and that he felt really lonely. during this same time my brother met a girl at his local gym, started off as friends, slowly kept bonding and you guessed they did the sex. he told me this occasion only happened once and pretty much cut her off after that night because he started to feel guilty for a short while. few months later his relationship turned for the better for him and his wife. pretty much after his wife's travels slowed down his whole relationship has been great. they've both gotten promotions, bought a house, more family vacations. (they have a kid) 
he told me life has been good to him now and he's just thankful things have finally worked out. 

as stated before i hate cheaters and i've always felt that the person being cheated on always has the right know. i know for sure this would probably destroy their marriage and there would be a fight for the kid. my heart tells me i have to tell her because it's the right thing to do, especially because i've known my brother to cheat one other time on an ex-girlfriend couple years before his current wife. my brain tells me it's none of my business and i should keep my mouth shut. i don't want to see their kid go throughout that kind pain either. on one hand i betray my brother if i say something on the other hand i betray our close family friend because i know this secret and i don't say anything. i wish he never told me, ignorance is truly bliss. so there it is, if i said something?

tldr: brother cheated on his wife years ago because he was depressed, now everything is better and he told me about it, but now i feel obligated to tell his wife because she's a close friend. wibta?

edit: i'm referring sil as close family friend because my family and her family have known each since elementary school days and thus are very close lol. i thought this iteration would make the relationship sound stronger than just sil, but it looks like i was wrong.

second edit: wow this is on the front page, i never intended nor expected this blow up as it did! i'm sorry i can't reply to everyone, but there will be some kind of update.",3

"if tinder is implementing a height setting for men, they should implement a weight setting for women.. tinder just announced a setting for men to show their height, under the reasoning that too many men lie about their height on the app and as they put it, are ""height fishing"" women. i can just about guarantee they won't do a fucking thing  about weight for women. i have friends who have been fat fished. that's essentially the same damn thing. why the hell should guys show their height if women won't show their weight. it's so fucking dumb to me. a girl doesn't like a guy because of his height? ""you go girl!"", ""girl power!"", blah blah blah. a guy doesn't like a girl because she's fat? ""asshole!"", ""so misogynistic!"", blah blah blah. it annoys the living fuck out of me that women aren't held to the same societal standards regarding attraction that men are. 

&#x200b;

let me be clear, **i have no issue with a woman if she is fat. i am just not attracted to it. also, it is totally okay with me if a woman isn't attracted to me because i'm 5'9""** 

&#x200b;

yes i'm aware that the height setting is optional, similar to bumble, and it's not as bad as something like hinge where you're required to put your height, whereas women aren't required to put their weight. while this is about tinder's new settings, i think it really opens up the societal double standard regarding attraction to the opposing sex and it just pisses me the fuck off.

"for privately asking my friend about the paternity of her children. saw another post that reminded me of this situation.

a few years ago, my close childhood friend gave birth to triplets. her husband is a light black man. of the three, two were the same skin tone as her husband, and the third was much darker. the skin tones made me a little suspicious that her husband might not be the father.

i pulled her aside privately and asked her seriously if her husband was the father. she didn't even listen or answer rationally, she just freaked out at me and acted super insulted and kicked me out. i reached out to her husband and told him about her reaction and told him he should get a paternity test and he called me an asshole and blocked me. neither has spoken to me since.

i've always thought that they dramatically over reacted and were probably hiding something because of their responses, but they're still married and sometimes i feel bad about what happened. i just felt a lot of empathy for her husband because i would be devastated if i wasn't confident that i was the father of my future children. was i an asshole for asking privately?

edit- okay i get it i'm an asshole. i want to make it clear that i didn't think the triplets had different fathers. i'm not an idiot. i thought it was possible, given the skin tone of the third triplet, that all three were fathered by a darker man and the first two were a bit lighter because my friend was very fair",3

"for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising?. so my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she's heard good things about. we get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, i'm hungry. 

i look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients i've never heard of. i order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki i think ($18). very important, these were listed as entrees on the menu. mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

so anyway we order as we are starving. my steak arrives and i am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. i joke to the waiter ""where's the rest of my steak?"" and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. i don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. when i go to restaurants i expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

i'm complaining to my girlfriend and she's getting annoyed with me. similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. granted the food was pretty good but i can not get over how tiny these portions are. i'm a big guy and i like to eat, what can i say. 

when the waiter comes back i inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. my girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, i don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

a manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. i don't end up paying as they realized i called them out on their bullshit. my girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. im still hungry so i drive through mcdonald's and get a burger, and when i did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. it's now the next day and i'm starting to think i didn't handle the situation as well as i could have (i could have probably just asked for a discount). my girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now i'm starting to think i'm an asshole.

am i the asshole?",3
"trying to force someone into atheism is just as bad as trying to force someone into christianity.. i am one of those atheists who doesn't care what religion people around me practice. i would honestly rather just let people be. i don't think i am more intelligent or better than people who do religion. i have been seeing several threads on reddit calling everyone who has done religion ""dumb"", ""detached from reality"", etc. albert einstein was a jew, does being an atheist automatically make us more intelligent than him? no.

and it also makes me cringe when atheists try to force religious people into atheism. if we are going to strongly condemn christians trying to force others into christianity, we should condemn atheists trying to force atheism on to other people.

if it doesn't affect you, just let people be.

edit: thanks for bringing einstein to my attention, with him being ethnically jewish, growing up in a jewish family, but not really believing in it too much himself. that being said, intelligent and accomplished people who are religious, do obviously exist. isaac newton, someone who was gifted with math but extremely anti-social, was a devout (un-orthodox) christian. if you don't want to use scientists as an example, james madison, who wrote the bill of rights that is idolized by many, was also christian. the conclusion i am making is that being religious doesn't equal stupidity, and atheism doesn't equal intelligence or success.",6
"by teaching my baby sign language. i go to this ""mommy and me"" thing every week with my daughter. not because it's my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as ""a christmas gift"" to my one-year-old (aka she doesn't think i am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).

anyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. but all these kids know sign language, and i thought that was pretty damn cool. so i start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it's working! suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say ""more"" and ""all done"" and ""drink""! she can call me mom and my husband, dad! holy shit! thanks pinterest moms! i take back all the shit i talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. 

well today with my husband out of town, i didn't feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants i decided to go out for a quick dinner. the kid loves french fries and so do i. so we hit the local burger joint and i order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. the server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and i set it out of her reach so she doesn't hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. so of course every time she wants some, she signs ""drink"". and every time she wants my attention, she signs ""dad"" because apparently the slightly different sign for ""mom"" isn't as fun for her. ok, whatever. 

well i notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they're looking over at us and snickering. i'm like okay, i did like 4 quick google searches, maybe i botched some of what i taught her. it's fine. but then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iphone down with a message typed out for me to read. it says something to the effect of ""she's calling you 'dumb' and telling you she wants to drink alcohol"". 

i'm like... wait... what? so she continues to show me that i have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for ""drink (non-alcoholic beverage)"" and ""drink alcohol"" and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since i am her mom. i can only imagine what the pinterest moms would've done had i shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. 

tl;dr asl is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing

eta: thanks, everyone! i'm glad you all enjoyed this post. please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that i was trying to teach my child proper asl. they were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as asl. they just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!

also please note that i literally searched ""baby sign language"" and based the signs off of still frames from google. i have no idea how close they were to the real signs. additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. she speaks english well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. we were always sure to say the words while signing them. she now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that i decided to share with you all. i'm new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen ""today"". you can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :)",4

"a bad teacher has a worse influence on society than a drug dealer. a bad teacher can make hundreds of people hate a subject, or even school, for their whole life. this means while an average drug dealer has bad influence on society and on their clients, if we compare individually one teacher and one drug dealer, it's debatable if having a bad influence on the education and professional life of hundreds of children is worse or not than selling drugs to a smaller fraction of the people. i think it is.

furthermore, a child giving up school while young because of a teacher is way more likely to die young or to go to jail, or even to become a drug dealer, which is quite ironic here, because if a bad teacher caused only one dealer, he has had a worse influence than a dealer. for those of you who will say that drug dealers actually kill people when teachers don't, a lot of people turn to drugs (excluding medicinal) in indirect consequence of quitting school, which is not to blame only on teachers, but they should take a part of the blame, and a huge one in some cases

ps: i am not defending drug dealing, i am just comparing it to teachers.

she has held onto the fingertip touch and it has taken on a life its own, a bit like a not-at-all-secret handshake for us. we always do it before she goes to sleep.

her: *puts out finger* finger!

me: *touches finger* ouch!

super cute right? well... she has now taken to doing it anywhere, at any time. it became pretty annoying and when i tried to curb the frequency of it, i was met with disaster. last weekend we were at the mall when she announced loudly in a quiet jewelry store that she was going to give me the finger. a little embarrassing but not too bad. i told her that she can't say it like that because ""the finger"" sometimes means something bad. she nods, understanding and the moment passes. a few days later, at dinner with my in-laws, the handshake returns to the forefront of her mind. mid-meal, she says, ""finger! oh no wait, that's bad..."" she then thinks for a moment and screams, ""daddy, finger me!"" if i could have turned into a flock of birds and flown away forever, i would have. my in-laws turn bright red and stare at her. i immediately say, ""no no, that's not what its called"". my daughter doubles down, ""yes! finger me! ouch! remember? ouch!"" i nearly passed out.

we are now trying to rebrand the handshake as ""et"" and ""ouch"" because jesus christ i can't take her anywhere.

i jumped out and asked what was going on and the woman said she'd found my daughter a block away (even further the opposite direction from the daycare) walking in the middle of the road and she was taking her to the police station (i have no reason to doubt the woman's intentions because there was a police station on this road.) 

i drove my daughter back to the daycare and the caregivers were unaware she was even missing.

i was in such a state of shock and panic thinking of everything that could have happened to my daughter if she had not been discovered by a good samaritan that i just calmly asked questions, gathered information, wrote it all down and sent it in an email to the owner to get a time stamp and confirmation of the events, as well as notify them we would be withdrawing her.

as the title states my wife was recently sued, she lost and we had to pay. the money is a significant amount for us, we didn't have much in savings or our emergency fund to begin with, and both of those accounts are now empty. 

my currently problem is trying to move past the resentment and anger i'm feeling towards my wife. until now i've always felt like we were a partnership in our marriage. but, since i'm the breadwinner i can't help but to feel like i'm spending ""my"" money on something that isn't my fault. i've had no problem paying the mortgage, and taking care of various financial burdens that come with being a married homeowner. however, i have been the only one to put money aside in our savings and other accounts to prepare for an emergency - like a totaled car, someone loses their job, medical bills, or an act of godâ¦ not a stupid lawsuit where i know my wife is guilty. she has a part time job and doesn't make much money, but pays for smaller things when she can (like groceries and some random bills), but she does take care of a lot of cooking, cleaning and caring for our pets. 

what did my wife do? (note: i had no idea this was going on while it was happening). 

she used linkedin to find her former ex best friend, she ended up creating a realistic looking fake linkedin profile with a vague occupation of 'recruiter'. my wife ended up sending this ex-best friend, ""laura"" a few messages pretending to be a recruiter in her line of work. laura finally responded thinking that this recruiter was real, my wife wanted her phone number but laura gave her a personal email address instead. my wife created a second fake linkedin profile and started to send messages to people with similar titles as laura at her company. these messages said derogatory things about laura, a mixture of truthful things but embarrassing and just fabricated bullshit to make laura look bad. her manager got one of these messages that claimed that laura was a heavy drug user. laura's manager talked to her about these messages and he felt like the messages were bizarre and seemed like someone was trying to troll or harass laura. well, laura team had her back and helped her saved these messages. not only that, but laura requested that she be drug tested anyway, to provide further evidence that she was clean. my wife didn't know this at this point, but laura was pregnant. several of her coworkers, including her manager testified on laura behalf. 


using the personal email address she got from the fake recruiter profile, she was able to find a few social media platforms laura was on and was able to figure out her husbands name. she did some more internet sleuthing and found laura's husband on facebook. laura's husband didn't have much on his facebook profile, but you could see his business email address on it. my wife sent him an email claiming that laura was cheating on him. the husband confronted laura about this email and laura encouraged him to keep responding to this person, and save the messages, as well as to start asking specific questions about this supposed affair.  my wife thought she was being clever and ended up telling the husband that laura was cheating on him during the work week, she even gave him specific dates. what she didn't realize was laura had something turned on in google maps where it keeps years worth of historical gps data. some of the dates my wife gave him also happened to be days where they both worked from home together. she also ended up giving him dates during a time they were on vacation together. laura had her husband keep responding as much as possible to my wife and to backup all correspondence. 


my wife was able to  find out when and where the baby shower was going to be. one of laura friends had created a public registry for her and had the invitation online. my wife decided to show up unannounced (the baby shower took place in a semi-public place, they had rented out an area connected to the public business.) she did not make herself known immediately. instead she looked for patrons that were entering and exiting the rented out room. she was able to get the attention of a few guests that had never met her and tried to gossip about laura - my wife was telling people that laura didn't actually know who the father was, among other things. this was at an event where her husband was at as well. the word got back around to laura and she spotted my wife and apparently immediately put together all the pieces of what happened. 


i'm leaving a fair amount of information out - my wife was able to find phone numbers, social media accounts and email for other people in laura circle and sent them messages about laura on multiple occasions. all the messages were trying to paint laura in an extremely derogatory light. all the events i've mentioned so far took place over a year or so.  my wife didn't think to mask her ip address, so it was pretty easy to find out that all of these made up messages came from the same ip address, ours. many of laura's friends and family testified on her behalf, laura had everyone saved as much digital evidence as possible - and it was a lot. 


laura and her husband hired a lawyer and decided to sue to my wife. they had ample evidence against her. all the saved messages, close friends and even her manager spoke on her behalf, she showed that she went to see a therapist once all the harassment started because she was depressed and anxious, she showed that she and her husband went to counseling after the accusations of her cheating. she even went above and beyond and had more drug tests done to show she was clean and my wife's accusations were 100% false, and even had a paternity test done to show that my wife was again wrong and chose to lie. 


i honestly felt awful for laura, there were lots of tears on her end. you could tell how much emotional stress she had gone through. she said that being pregnant during the majority of this was absolutely horrific and was worried the stress and anxiety would somehow hurt her baby. she was pained that her one and only baby shower was ruined by my wife and that was something that could never be truly repaid or made up for. and that my wife's harassment continued even after laura gave birth and was trying to manage a newborn child. 


my wife has never done anything this crazy before. i knew she could be a little petty and jealous of others, especially people she use to be friends with in the past, but it was only talk - no action. we've had a very happy marriage otherwise, we rarely fight, have a lot in common, we have a lot of fun together. but, she really fucked up this time. i don't know how to move forward. i know someone is going to suggest therapy, but i really want to start building up an emergency fund again. we're pretty screwed financially for awhile. 


**tl;dr** wife was sued by her former best friend, i emptied out all of our savings and sold a few things to pay for everything. i need help managing my resentment towards my wife and to move past this. funds are low and we can't afford therapy right now. what can we do to move forward?",8
"for asking my cousin not to bring his autistic son (my nephew) to my home any more because of a romantic attachment to my wife?. i know from the title, it definitely sounds like i would be the asshole but please hear me out. i have an older cousin whose son, my nephew, is in his early 20s. my nephew is autistic and holds a part time job, but is significantly delayed in many developmental areas (i don't know the specifics) and will never be independent according to his parents. 

recently, my cousin and cousin-in-law have been thinking about relocating to our state because of recent job opportunities, and we've hosted them in the past when they've visited. the first time they stayed with us (before my son was born), my nephew seemed to develop a strong attachment to my wife and always wanted to be near her. he drew a picture of a heart and picked some flowers from our yard and gave them to her before they left, saying he loved her. my wife thought this was sweet and gently handled his crush by telling him she would always love him as his aunt, but she was sure he would find another girl to fill his heart soon. he told her no, she was his girlfriend. 

this weekend, they were staying with us again and my nephew again wanted to be near my wife every chance he got. his mom and dad noticed and told him that because my wife now had to care for our son, she couldn't pay attention to him as much as before. he got upset telling us that she was his girlfriend and had a meltdown, which caused my son to start crying. when my wife got up to take our son to another room to calm him down, my nephew got up to follow and his dad had to forcibly restrain him from following them. i stood up to block the hallway into the separate room just in case he got away from his dad. 

once they calmed him down, they apologized for his behavior and said they would keep better tabs on him. here's the part where i may be the asshole. i told my cousins i didn't feel comfortable with my nephew being so possessive of my wife, and i know for sure she didn't, especially since he seemed to be so jealous of our son. i told them i couldn't allow their son in our home until he learned to control himself and understand that my wife was not his girlfriend. i apologized but asked them to get a hotel room for the rest of their stay and not to visit us again unless they left my nephew behind with people they could trust and knew would care for him, while they searched for jobs in our state. they didn't say anything but looked saddened and went to the guest room with their son to pack up their bags. 

i guess they must have told my extended family what happened because my paternal grandmother called me this afternoon, telling me that i should've been more understanding and that i was wrong to ask them to leave. 

am i the asshole?

edit for added info: 

thank you to everyone who took the time to comment or private message me with their own experiences with family members who are/were autistic. there's not nearly enough time for me to respond to each of the comments (which honestly surprised me when i saw how many had reached out to me), but i wanted to address some questions that had been asked. 

1. the first one is that technically, my cousin is my second cousin. my dad is an only child so the cousin i refer to in my post, is the son of my own dad's first cousin (my paternal grandmother and his paternal grandfather were siblings). i'm not sure if this is correct but his autistic son would technically be my third cousin(?). the reason i refer to him as my nephew is because he's the generation after mine in our family tree and it's less of a mouthful to refer to him as cousin-x-removed. a lot of people have posted that it's not correct to refer to him as my nephew but to be frank, i don't care, and my family's never followed this traditional genealogy nomenclature. i apologize if it was misleading in my post. without being specific, in the western state i was born and grew up in, it's not uncommon to refer to even close (unrelated) adults as uncles or aunts. i call him my nephew because my cousin and i were close and i still hope to have a close relationship with him if at all possible (though i don't know how after this situation). 

2. some have asked if i was jealous of my nephew calling my wife his gf. the first time, i thought it was amusing and was surprised that he had any romantic notions towards anyone, let alone my wife. remember, in my mind he's my nephew and i never thought of him as anything other than a large kid because of his developmental delays and normal (for him) childlike behavior. regarding the situation that happened this weekend, i was only concerned for my wife and son's safety. i didn't know how he would react and followed my cousin's lead, but wasn't about to let him get near my wife and son once they left the room. 

3. i don't know what was said to my paternal grandmother but i don't want to react in anger and want to talk to my cousin once we've both had time to process what happened and calmed down.",3

"by giving my boyfriend head without locking the door. throwaway account because obviously.

my boyfriend and i are staying at his parents house for a few days for the holidays. we got in a couple days ago, exchanged gifts, and are generally spending quality time. we're staying in his old bedroom and last night before bed, we were both feeling frisky. i started by giving him a blowjob but when we both started getting into it, neither of us wanted to stop, so i figured on going to completion. unfortunately we were both so caught up in the moment, we forgot about locking the door.

so there i am on my knees, arms holding onto his sides, bobbing my head in a mad dash, getting excited from how close he is and then suddenly the door opens. his mom comes in! i freak out and pull his dick out of my mouth but apparently he's past the point of no return and starts spraying my face and boobs with his baby batter, giving me my first ever facial. meanwhile his poor mom - who was apparently just checking to make sure we had everything we needed before bed - is just staring at us with a dropped jaw. eventually she just says sorry and backs out of the room. 

anyways, it's 5:40am, i've barely slept last night stressing about breakfast and any family interactions tomorrow.

tl;dr: bf's mom walked in on him giving me my first facial.

update @7:31am - thanks for all the reassuring comments. my bf is convinced that she just came in and immediately left but the image of her just standing there for a couple seconds is seared into my brain so who knows what the truth is. anyway, the family is all starting to wake up and head down to breakfast but we're still hiding out in his room. more to come.

update @8:38am - of course my first gold is on a throwaway account... anyways thanks! so breakfast started off totally fine. i mean, yeah i was super awkward around everyone but the mom didn't say anything. that is, until i excused myself to go shower. she stopped me on the way to the bathroom and apologized for not knocking, which was super sweet. but then proceeded to follow up with a conversation on understanding how important sex is in a healthy relationship and made sure we were always being ""safe"". it was sweet and cringy all at once. i guess we somehow bonded a bit, which is nice :) 

anyways, we've got one more night here and you can be damn sure the door will be locked tonight!

update: a lot of people commenting about how the mom locked the door. actually i assumed she had locked the door on the way out (from the inside, not the outside); i didn't actually see her do it. i asked my bf about it and apparently he had locked it after she left while i was...ehm...cleaning.",4

"for telling my sister to get over her daughter's achievements?. i am one of five children, and we all have grown up/late teen children. they're everything from lawyers to accountants to welders to hairdressers, and everyone is happy. 

my sister paula's daughter amy is the most successful of the bunch. she's 22 and has recently graduated from one of the best universities in the world with a degree in biochemistry and started a job as soon as she finished her course.

i don't dislike amy but she's always been trouble. i have a daughter the same age as her, charlotte. when they were younger amy did a great job convincing charlotte that she'd never be as pretty as amy, and once tried to push her out of a family photo because she wasn't pretty enough. 

when amy graduated, paula held a post-graduation party at her place, and amy was the centre of attention as she deserved to be, but ever since then paula has gone out of her way to make amy the centre of attention everywhere. over the summer my brother, his wife and their two kids went to a theme park. amy wanted to go too and paula demanded they take her, for no other reason than that ''she's just graduated from x''. amy behaved like a brat the entire time and paula excused her behaviour for the exact same reason. 

amy smoked weed at my parents house a few weeks back. i don't mind this but they do, but once again paula made them let her off due to her elite graduate status. 

the final straw came last weekend. my son mark just got engaged and we held an informal engagement party at our place. paula, her husband rob, and amy were there, and paula set about trying to convince me to let amy play a big part in the wedding, which is a while away. mark's fiancee vicky barely knows amy, and she will of course have her own people in mind for her bridal party. paula said amy deserves a big part because of her achievements, and also because she's so pretty she'd make the perfect bridesmaid. 

i was frustrated and told paula that amy's achievements do not mean she deserves special treatment, and that being an elite graduate and pretty doesn't make her better than anyone else. i told paula amy was a spoiled brat who needs to get on with her life. 

unfortunately the music wasn't very loud and everyone heard. amy heard and stormed away crying, and the whole family have been texting and calling me saying i was wrong for humiliating ''a child'' in public.

"meta you can still be the asshole if you were wronged. i've been a lurker on this subreddit for a while, and as its been getting bigger, i've been noticing a trend in what's being posted. op was wronged, probably unintentionally, and had a poor reaction. their friends are saying it was over the top, mom is mad, the bystanders are upset, etc... are they the asshole? and there is a resounding chorus of nta! you don't owe anyone anything! or someone was mean to op, and they were mean back, and their friends say they shouldn't have been. aita?  no! they were rude so you get to be as well! 

i dont think either of these really reflect how people should be engaging with others. sometimes we do things in the moment when we're upset or hurt we wouldn't do otherwise. these reactions are understandable. but just because its understandable doesn't mean op can't be the asshole. 

being wronged doesnt give you a free pass to do whatever you want without apology. people make mistakes, and people can be thoughtless or unkind.  it is possible to react to that in a way that is unnecessarily cruel or overblown.

"for refusing to accept my parents ""gift"" and then walking out.. throwaway as my dad uses reddit. 

so i'm close to graduating high school and have been applying to universities and looking at some by doing the tours and stuff. 

my parents decided to give me a gift for when i graduate, its 10,000$ toward my uni costs. i remember screaming and hugging my parents and thanking them. 

that was untill i found out the terms and conditions, i can only go to 2 universities (they are the ones closest to my parents) and they gave me a selection of courses i can pick from, surprisingly art degree is not one of them. 

so i told my parents that i cant accept the gift as i dont want to abide by some terms and conditions,i also told them it was kinda shitty to pay me to do what they want me to do. 
i explained that i now feel bad for being super excited because i definitely cant accept my gift now knowing what the rules are. 

 this caused a massive fight where i was called ungrateful and that i'm not a nice daughter. so i walked out of the house and have been staying with a friend until this cools off.

"police broke into my home because my child cried during the night while i was asleep. this has been a really weird morning... not sure if i chose the correct flair

i have a 5 year old who stays with me during the weekends. he sleeps all night without any issues (except for the very rare nightmake/sleep talking). lastnight he was the happiest little kid in the world because we put up our christmas tree. i put him to bed around 9pm and watched some movies with my fiance who lives with me. around 3am i got sleepy and wen to join her in bed. she gets up around 4:30am to go to work and leaves around 5am.

at 6:30am i am awoken by a single low knocking sound. i get up all sleepy thinking its my kid jumping on the bed (at which point i usually just get up, make sure he brushed his teeth and put some cartoons on to buy me a few more z's). as i exit my room i am greeted to 4 cops staring me down across the hallway. i dont immediatly register what is going on and wonder if i should serve them a drink. one cop asks me who i am to which i reply with my full name and ask what is going on. he continues his interrogation, asking if i live with a woman. fear slowly starts to creep up to me, thinking she was in an accident. i answer that i live with my girlfriend. the cop asks me if i have a son to which i reply yes. he asks me where he is. at this point i lean over the wall and i see my door busted upen. i am thinking someone killed my fiance and took my kid so i look at the cop, turn, head down the corridor to bis room and slowly open it fearing the worst. i see my son in bed, still tucked in and looking at me as if nothing happened. i come back down the hallway and tell the cop ""he is there, what is going on!?"" the tell me to step out into the dining room and i put my hands up as i walk past them. 2 cops walk into my room and check inside. i sit at the table and the cop sits next to me as another watches over us. i look to the door and theres the lady that guards the complex i live in with another lady i have never seen before just peaking into my home.

 the cop questioning me tells me someone heard  a child crying and called the police. he says they got there at 5am, which would mean they got there just as my fiance left for work. he claims they called at my door for an hour and a half and no one answered, then they heard detonations inside and decided to storm in. they never went outside my window to call me which would have done the trick. my apartment has weird acoustics and i cannot hear knocking in the living room from my room, if the door is locked, especially since my front door has a protective gate that doesnt allow for knocking.

he asks me why i didnt hear him and i told him i must have been deeply asleep. he asks if i am under the influence of drugs and i say i just went to bed late because i was playing red dead redemption.cop gives me a case number (not sure what they are called) and tells me to give that to administration so they fix the door (thats not how that works) and they leave. as the cops leave i could hear them talking with one of the ladies who was saying the child was crying too hard for it to be nothing. the cop told her there was no evidence of abuse or wrongdoing and she just couldnt believe it. i asked my son if he was crying and he said yes. i asked him why and he said the fan stopped working...

so now i am sitting in an apartment with my son and a broken front door. i fear when i go outside i'll be judged by my neighhbours as the child beater or worse.

i have been trying to understand the timeline of events. i went to bed at 3am and my fiance got up at 4:30 then left at 5. if the cops got there at 5am as they claim, then the call must have happened around 3:00 - 4:30. my son must have stopped crying before my fiance fo up and didnt resume his crying for the rest of the night. the cops get here at 5 and hang outside my door until 6:30 when they hear the ""detonatios"" not a crying child. my son had no signs of having been crying and he even stood next to me on his own during the police questioning.

is the police right to have broken into my home like that, leaving my household exposed and then just leave like nothing happened? what about the detonations they claim they heard in my apartment? was that just an excuse to burst in? he sort of implied the detonations where heard outside and got them freaked out.

"by going down a reddit rabbit hole.. this didn't happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and i bought a new car. i was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. don't worry, you'll understand why that's relevant soon enough.

i came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse reddit while i'm taking care of my business. most of you are probably doing just that right now....don't judge me. i can't remember what sub i was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. before i knew it i was reading about ""the donkey show."" yes that one. some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. i wasn't interested in seeing what that was all about, so i just kept reading.

someone mentioned and linked another post talking about how the donkey show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. midget porn. i thought, ""what the hell, i've never seen this sort of thing before."" so i clicked.

as weird as it sounds, i clicked out of curiosity......i swear. what i saw was exactly what i expected to see. this specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. after a minute or so, i had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub i was in.

i finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. i get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.

she was taking a while, so i grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. my wife comes out and gets in the car. immediately she says, ""what the hell is this?"" i put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. on the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of ""blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com"". i had never had a car with this feature before, so i was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. i knew i was screwed. it felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so i could change what was displayed on the screen.

after about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks i have a thing for little people. before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. all i could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. i'm pretty sure i'll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. yay me...

she said to me one day, ""i know you won't leave me for another woman, but i'm afraid you'll leave me for half of one.""

i doubt she will ever let this one go...

tl;dr i went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.

edit: damn! i fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, you guys are awesome! i'm glad you got a kick out of my mishap.

edit2: just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while i was pleading my case, we kept it very g rated.

"update: mym25 girlfriend24 of 1.5 years broke up with me to be with my roommatem25. i just heard them through the wall.. it's been about a month since my post, unfortunately the mods deleted it from /r/relationships. i don't know if this one will be allowed but i figured i'd give an update to my situation. 

original post:

https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8ykrq1/mym25_girlfriend24_of_15_years_broke_up_with_me/

> as the title says, we broke up. it was about 6 months ago and it was semi-amicable. we broke up because she was developing feelings for my roommate. admittedly they are more compatible and he's an upgraded version of me, so i can see why it happened.
> 
> this isn't an evil thing, both asked my permission to start dating and don't do any pda while i'm around. i still both consider them friends and i just want them to be happy.
> 
> for the most part, they are quiet at night. if i really listen i can hear whats going on, but they generally save it for when they are alone. except for last night. we went out to the bar for his birthday and they got pretty drunk. i was the dd because i don't really drink. anyway, last night we got home at close to 2am and all went to bed. i made sure they both got into bed, put water, advil, and buckets out just in case. i then put sleeping bags out for the other people and did the same. as i was brushing my teeth my ex walked in, hugged me and said she was sorry. she thanked me for always begin so nice and she promised to help me find a new girlfriend when i was ready. when i finally got to bed i could head muffled talking, mostly about how great the night was. then it got quiet and then it started.
> 
> i don't know how long it lasted, but it was louder than normal. i've been okay with the break up until now, i'm glad they're happy but last night i fell asleep crying.
> 
> i woke up this morning, made breakfast for everyone and started to clean up.
> 
> feel free to ignore this, i just needed to get this off my chest. i'm sad when i really think about the situation, but that's why i try not to.
> 
> tl;dr: my ex and roommate are sleeping together and they were loud last night.

taking everyone's advice i announced that i was going to be moving out. my now ex-roommate pulled me aside and asked if it was because of his relationship. i told him yes, but i'm not going to make him sacrifice his happiness just for me. he decided to help me look for a new place and we found one. it's a one bedroom apartment that is closer to my work. my landlord is xrms(ex-roommate) family friend, after xrm explained the situation i ended up getting a slight discount on rent for the first year. 

xrm and xgf and a few other friends helped me move in. i had a house warming party and was specifically asked that i not prepare anything. 7 people came over with dinner, desert and booze. xrm and xgf also cleaned up after everyone finished eating. my xgf stayed a bit later than everyone and apologized for putting me through everything. she said she didn't really think about how it made me feel. she told me that she's talked to a few friends about finding me someone and that she had set up a blind date for me. it was great. we've gone out a few times since our first date. 

the past few weeks have been the best in a long time, i never really realized how bad my situation was. obviously everything isn't perfect, and i still have to work on my self esteem and standing up for myself but i'm in an infinitely better position than before.  

tl;dr: i moved out and started dating a new girl. ",8

&#x200b;

&#x200b;

ok so i first of all want to thank everyone for your honest replies, it really helped me to get my feelings straight and get ready to confront her.

&#x200b;

so after a week of avoiding i came to her house with a picnic basket by surprise so ill have a chance to speak with her. she was happy to see me and i told her to sit down because we need to talk.

i started things with saying that i know that she has a secret that she's been hiding from me for years. her face turned red and she started crying like hell. she knew what i was talking about. i told her the story about the dna test, about jennet and basically what i told you guys in the last post.

well after she calmed down a bit she told me the truth. she told me how she got drunk at a party and slept with one of the jerks who does nothing but weed every day. he didn't really care about a future kid and was like ""yeah whatever"". apparently she found out that 10 years ago he was stabbed in prison after sitting for drug dealing, assult and armed robbery. 

she told me how her mother used to convince her father to talk me out of the idea of keeping the baby. they would constantly fight with her. when the baby was born they told her on the spot that she brought shame upon the family and they will not help raising the baby in any way, meaning she will have to work meanwhile to have money for her baby and sometimes for herself. after a couple of months of loaning from her friends and juggling between working and taking care of me she had a huge fight with her parents and told them that if they are not helping financially and barely in any sort of way, she and me are better off without them. as they sent her to her room she escaped in the middle of the night, hitchhiked to a neighboring country and by morning she was there already. she tried to take care of me for a few days, she found an old abandoned house that used to have homeless people coming around every now and then, and she took me to the mall when i started crying. she started crying too. the couple that adopted us immediately came to our aid and asked if \_we\_ lost our mother. rose jumped on the opportunity and came up with a story and an alias. police figured out we are not in the system for multiple reasons. we were raised in foster care for a year and a half until the couple that helped us decided to make the effort and adopt us so we won't be separated. it took them a few months and a couple of lawyers but they managed to adopt us both.

rose knew all along that her parents are looking for her(they came to their senses after a day or so). she reached out to them and told them in a letter that she is fine and is taking care of herself and me, she is not homeless and found a nice couple to help her with the baby. she made it clear for them that she is never coming back and they should stop looking, and a month after that they stopped.

a few years later her father went on a quest to find her(she was after 18) secretly. after so much time searching he found her and apologized and after a while she forgave him and kept secretly in touch with him. he met me a few times and i knew him as one of rose's old friends from the park. he helped us a few times and apparently they would meet up once every two months secretly. ironically i'm glad i got to know him before he passed, even if i didn't know who he really is. 

&#x200b;

btw, the adoptive family never found out about the whole thing.

&#x200b;

so after hearing this i told her we missed a lot by not knowing she is my mother and i told her i understand she did the right thing. i pulled out an ""it's a boy!"" sign from the picnic basket and some snacks for a late baby shower and we hugged for an hour or so, had a lot of fun, watched a movie and i headed off to my parents(adoptive) house to have dinner with them.

&#x200b;

i'm glad she is my mother. i feel for the first time in years - complete. i don't care she lied because she did it for the greater good and i honestly can't imagine my life right now if she didn't. thanks reddit for helping me getting my feelings straight and helping me out mentally to coop with everything that happened!",8
"if someone tells you ""i'll pray for you"" with sincerity, and you respond with a rude comment about religion, you're an asshole.. while i'm not sure just how unpopular this opinion is, i'm putting it in this sub because i've seen it happen so many times recently.

don't get me wrong, there are some exceptions to this rule--if someone has the ability to help with something, but doesn't want to get off their ass, but still wants brownie points for ""helping"" and so they pull the ""i'll pray"" card, then yes, they are the asshole.

"my (f 25) husband (m 28) said something disgusting to me. i can't stop thinking of it. i've been in the bath for a long time because i've been dreading going to bed with him. 

a few hours ago i was lying in bed feeding our baby. my husband was begging me to come do something with him. i tried to tell him just to wait a few moments.  he kept glaring at me and telling me to hurry up. 

i just gave birth a couple months ago, and my husband has been so jealous of his own son.

i could see he was starting to lose his patience and i told him ""honey i have to take care of him before you, you know that"". and what he said back was really stunning. he looked me right in the eyes and said ""if you love him so much, why don't you suck his dick instead of mine"". i couldn't say anything, i didn't know what to say. and then he stormed out of our bedroom. 

i don't even know what to make of this. what should i do? it just bothers me so deeply, it's going to be hard for me to forgive. i really don't have many other complaints about my husband, most days things are great with him but that just made sick to my stomach. am i just being sensitive? maybe i'm just emotional, but i feel like crying.",8
"update - mi, usa considering suing my uncle after he intentionally fired an air horn meant for bears in my ear, and now i have what appears to be a permanent ringing in my ear. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi\_usa\_considering\_suing\_my\_uncle\_after\_he/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/btauw7/mi_usa_considering_suing_my_uncle_after_he/)

i promised an update so here it is. first off, i want to thank everyone who strongly suggested i go see a doctor asap. i went to see an ent and audiologist approximately a week and a half after the incident occurred. my hearing test came back normal, which was very reassuring. the tinnitus was still quite bad, so i wanted to see if the doc could help with that. he put me on a steroid cycle for a week and a half, which just ended yesterday. i saw him again a week after the first visit, and we decided to try a steroid injection directly into both ear drums. (this was a very unpleasant experience, as you can probably imagine)

the ringing has gone down considerably, and i'm hopeful it will eventually be completely gone. it still bothers me at night and while i'm trying to work sometimes. the biggest problem lately has been that these steroids cause insomnia, so i haven't gotten a good night's sleep in weeks. this has caused me to have to cancel a summer project, since at this point i'm far too behind schedule to complete it.

my uncle has agreed to pay for all medical costs. i'm not planning on suing him. he knows he fucked up and was apparently crying on the phone when my parents called him to tell them what i was going through. my aunt has also had a really rough time since finding out the extent of the damage. i haven't talked to either one of them since it happened, and don't plan on talking to him any time soon. they have offered to call me and apologize but i don't want to talk to them. i just don't want to be around the guy after what he did to me. i'll probably end up spending some holidays alone, but i don't care. fuck that guy. thanks for hearing my story and for all the advice.",2

"me (m34) and fiancee (f27), i am in the process of calling a halt to our wedding as she has asked for an ""open"" relationship.. alright folks where to start, this one is tough to type and the paws are shaking as i'm doing it. as it says in the title, me and my fiancee (ex?) are 34 and 27 respectively, have been together for nearly four years overall and are a year engaged. i'll be totally honest here, just before we got engaged she had an emotional affair with a bloke that she worked with (i only found  out because one of her friend's bf contacted me and said that he overheard the friendgroup discussing it). i confronted her at the time, and after a good bit of arguing and hassle, we came to an agreement to let it go. i'll be totally honest in saying that i'm still slightly in the process of getting over that particular incident, and it discoloured my view of her. i manned up, moved on and proposed (which i had planned on doing anyway). this is just to give an overall context here and indeed to let it be known that there has been issues in the past. 

&#x200b;

fast forward to recent time. we are due married in november (travelling abroad for it with family), and back around october she started acting a bit odd. distant, not herself, away with the fairies. even stopped having sex, which was very strange. i put it down to stress around organising the wedding, and the fact that we had moved flat. forward to christmas time, and now things are coming to a head. i confronted her straight up, and she set out that she was sorry, has just been stressed. i was very considerate, and tried to help her through it. 

&#x200b;

however, it basically continued on ebbing and flowing throughout the next two months, up to yesterday. i arrived in from  work last night, and she says that she wants to talk. the vibe was bad guys, i could tell. we sat down and she set out that she had been reading, and that she wasn't having second thoughts about the marriage, but the 'nature' of our relationship. at this rate i was getting a bit agitated, and demanded that she come out with what the bloody hell she meant. basically, a few of her friends had back in october (the times matched up) conveyed to her the idea of an ""open relationship""...........basically they stay with their blokes and have one night stands on nights out if they fancy. i'll be honest, the idea made me ill. i said this to her, and she asked to be heard out. pulled out some online blog post by a blogger who had a husband and live-in boyfriend........i got half way through and told her enough of this nonsense. i wouldn't consider myself old-fashioned, but a wife or fiancee bonking other men will never be in fashion, not in my world anyway. we got into a fight, and in the end she was begging me to give it a chance and that nothing is set in stone. i basically said that i needed some headspace, and that i'd spend the weekend at my mates. it was quick after that, and i left without a fuss. i'm typing this on my mates laptop, and am in a bad mental way atm. i am seriously considering calling the whole thing off, both relationship and wedding. i suppose if anyone has been in a similar place i could do with some advice

-i always had good grades in high-school, was home on time, cleaned the house etc. i never had problems with my parents before this. 

-i went to med school, still living with parents when i was 20, i dated someone who was 23

-dad was against this because be does not believe in dating people far older than you (so like don't date far from your own age)  and says i cannot date j. 

-argument breaks out, dad says it's his house so either i agree or i move out. i say it's not fair as j has a job, goes to college, has future plans etc. dad kicks me out. mom agrees with his decision. little bro was only 14 at the time. 

-i moved with j, his family was supportive, helped me with my college (i went to another college due to financial reasons), finished my required years but still kept in touch with my lil bro

-years later, me and j (with the help of his parents) got a small house. (like really small but i'm happy with it). i ended up giving birth to a sweet baby girl. i let my lil bro know that he could come see her when he was able to.  he came a few times. 

-today, bro came to see the baby, and asked when i was going to let mom and dad see her since they wanted to reconnect. i said never and that i wasn't going to forgive them. bro says i'm being unreasonable as they were just strict and trying to protect me, i say that's bullshit because dad shouldn't have kicked me out over age. bro says i should at least let mom come because she didn't want to agree with it. i say mom was able to do something but didn't,but that bro's situation was different because he was only 15. bro is upset because he says mom and dad regret their decision and just want to reconnect and that i am dragging this entire situation. i told him that if he thinks i'm 'dragging it out' then he can stay out of my life too. he's angry and says that i need to move on and that i shouldn't be withholding them from seeing their grandchild. i say that they disowned me and so have no grandchild from a daughter that doesn't exist. 

aita? i don't hate my bro and i (kinda)  get what he is saying, but i just have a resentment for my parents. it's not like i had a baby just to put it against them,  but my lil bro thinks i'm going go die on a hill with them for something done several years ago and it's petty. i'm curious on what reddit thinks. i want a relationship with my bro, just not my mom and dad",3

the double standard makes it okay for women to commit to this kind of behavior, and we dont punish them equally, we're building two different social classes into the law. why does anyone think its ""just different"" for an older woman to have sex with a male compared for an older man?

https://youtu.be/em28yfrmdfi?t=9

here's a youtube video of snl making a joke about male students with female teachers, for instance.

there's actually reasons for making a valid reverse argument based on human development.

girls mature at 10 and boys have to wait til 20, for some things. (google brain data)

girls reach maximum (adult) height at 13-15, boys gets a 14-18 period to reach it. again showing that females mature sooner than males. 

girls are superior at emotional intelligence to boys, and ei is defined as the ability to read and understand others, their emotions, their thoughts, their intentions, etc. (google again)

therefore it would seem obvious they'd know more rather than less. because of all these verifiable facts, a 13 year old boy and 18 year old girl is leagues apart compared to a 13 year old girl and 18 year old boy, which would still be sick and disgusting. since this case deals with the reverse, and since people are praising him and her, it shows the double standard and unpopularity. it would be unanimous for an older male adult with a young girl to be considered a disgusting pedophile rapist, but on this one people equivocate because the roles are reversed. 

 the double standard throws child-males to the predatory women-wolves.

neither is acceptable. the double standard simply makes it sickening and worse, especially in light of the fact that it is males who are underdeveloped for that age period. if there were a progressive victim stack, males should be ahead of females on the list because of the developmental delay.

being a piece of shit accuser is something you'll deal with on your own time, not mine.

go after people in comments who say things like this if you're so triggered and so retarded.

>its absolutely disgusting how warped sexuality has become. your body is not a temple, its a sack of bacteria. sex is not a sacred ritual and nothing is lost when you have sex for the first time. get over yourselves. sex is as common and normal a practice as eating, sleeping and shitting.

>also, id like to know, at what age should one stop being attracted to young people? and i say stop because everyone is attracted to children at some point in their life, usually when they are a child.

>should it also be just as taboo to be 13 and want to fuck a 20 year old? why or why not?

>society does more damage to people based on judgement of a sexual act than the sexual act itself and its disgusting. you should honestly be ashamed of yourself for expressing and enforcing this opinion.

"for spiking my leftovers with ghost pepper flakes to teach my brother a lesson. so my little brother is notorious for eating other people's food knowing it's not his. after several talking to's from my parents he still doesn't care and if anything he will only eat mine and my sister's food which is still annoying. a few nights back we ordered pizzas from this one joint and we all order our own. i wasn't home that night but my dad took my order anyways knowing i'd eat it the next day. 

since all the boxes are the same and some pizzas look the same we write our names on the boxes to easily differentiate the pies, you'd think this would stop my brother but it didn't. i got home the next morning pretty hungry and dying to have some of my pizza. i open the fridge grab my box and lo and behold there's only 2 slices left. i know my sister didn't eat it because she hates pepperoni, it wasn't my mom because she's vegan, and my dad doesn't eat anyone's pizza without asking so i knew damn well it was my fatass little brother who ate not only his pizza but pretty much 3/4 of mine too. 

i'm beyond pissed at this point because the place we order from is really good and two small slices isn't going to cut it for me. knowing my brother would kill the rest of my box soon i decided to sprinkle ghost pepper flakes on the last two slices. we actually grow the peppers too so we have bunch in the freezer and a little jar of flakes for my sister and dad. so i'm in the living room minding my own and my little brother comes down to eat again and he's on his phone so he's barely paying attention. this fat fuck has the audacity to grab my pizza right in front of me too which just annoyed me even more. after he finishes nuking it he bites into one slice and i get up to the fridge to grab and hide the milk. i hear him freaking out and he didn't stop crying for an hour.",3

what i did not know was the entire time i was gone, my wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  she got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her ""fuck me"" lingerie.



so no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to surprise her.  a handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  the text told my son to stay outside.  i had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  



so my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  i told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  the look of confusion on her face was priceless.  it took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, there was our son in his dress uniform and she was estatic.  the noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  it goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess will have to suffice instead.




tl;dr  didn't tell wife that marine son was coming home, missed out on sexy times and the second half of the packers/falcons game

"by trying to buy an instant pot at target and probably ending up on a terrorist watchlist. this started yesterday but i didn't realize my fu until today.

yesterday, i stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt instant pot at target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. i decided i would get some christmas shopping done early and flip a few. i ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.

well the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. i go to target and give them my id, they look it up and can't find it at first. i give them the order number and i hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. the one says he has to let the manager know i'm there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but i didn't think much of it.

fast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. the doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. i step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the state police counter terrorism unit and they start questioning me about why i'm trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if i know what they can be used for, if i'm making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the target parking lot. i did my best to explain the price mistake and how i found it, etc. i think they accepted my explanation but i'm still nervous that i'm on a watchlist now.

tl:dr tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 instant pots at target, got interrogated by state police counter terrorism unit why i was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.

"kicked our at 16. parents took all my money.. i had posted this on other subs and was told to post here. 16f.

three nights ago my parents and i got in a huge fight. i am not a christian. they are extreme bible thumpers. i am bisexual, they believe i'm going to be burning in hell. i was forced to come out of the closet due to blackmail reasons, and my parents promptly kicked me out. 

i managed to get my dogs and my keys, took my car and left. we just moved to this state so i have no friends. my siblings all have the same beliefs as my parents. my related family is all thousands of miles away. last night, my parents cut off my phone plan and told me they're kicking me off of their insurance. right now i am on my own with my two large dogs, pitbull and american bulldog, sleeping in my car. my parents forced me to quit my job last week so i could focus more on school. last night i checked my bank account. my parents drained the 1k savings i had in it. it is completely empty. 

i'm just scared and don't know where to turn. i primarily want to be able to take care of my dogs. i do not want to give them up but i'm not sure how much longer i can without neglecting them. giving them up would be out of absolute desperation. i will not give up on them easily. having them around has protected me from many bad situations. 

i live in tennessee. any advice would be helpful.

i can't afford a lawyer to fight this in court. i said i would go to the doctor with her and get a paternity test, and she thinks i will falsify it by giving someone else's semen sample. she is trying to gaslight me into believing something that never happened, probably because the real father is a real loser like her.",2
"once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam.. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art.  their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic.  everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.  and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.  this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after.  as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... 

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved.  this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note.  people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.  words cannot do justice to the experience.  the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday.  all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note.  from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant.  sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage.  he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted!  the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains.  soon the entire monastery was aflame.  by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the order.  ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated.

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

i'm so hurt right now. she's said how sorry she is many times, and i believe her, but i feel so betrayed. 
we've had a great relationship up to this point, i've loved every minute of it. to add to it she tells me before that how she confided in him that she was scared of spending the rest of her life with someone and how she was unsure about our relationship. 
this hurts me to my core to think that someone i wanted to spend forever with could do this to me. out of all the women i've ever dated she was the one i was least worried about this happening with. 
she tells me that it was the biggest mistake she's ever made and how she regrets it, i just don't know if i can move on. 
we live together, have a dog, have built a life together which makes a breakup even more difficult.

"caretaker left cat without access to water for days and died as a result. i went out of town for 5 days and a co worker offered to check on my 4 cats while i was away. i came home to find they had no food or water and their litter box hadn't been cleaned in days. my oldest girl was in really bad shape, she couldn't move her back legs at all. i thought she just fell down the stairs and broke her back. took her to the icu and the doctor ran a lot of tests. the doctor explained to me that nothing was broken. she was extremely dehydrated, likely due to not having access to water in days. this caused a previously unknown/undiagnosed  diabetic episode which set her into shock. she suffered for two days in the icu before the doctor told me she was only getting worse and a decision had to me made. there was nothing they could do and she was terrified and suffering. i stayed by her side as they euthanized her. that was about 3 days ago. my heart is in pieces. 
there is no signed document of my friend agreeing to watch my cats. but i have text messages of when i tried to check in on them, then 42 messages in the morning and another 4 hours worth of messages from this friend trying to blame me for not reminding her and not telling her about an undiagnosed condition and even blaming me for trusting her.

i know i'm angry and grieving. but because of what this person did my cat suffered for days until i had to let her go.

"by eating the ends off a chicken wing.. yesterday i ate the ends of a chicken wing. someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so i tried it out. i never expected this to happen. 

i must not have chewed one properly. i got something lodged in my throat. to dislodge it i ate some bread and drank some softdrink. some pain persisted but i went to sleep last night hoping it'd be fine in the morning. 

this morning i woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. i walked to the public hospital down the road because i was starting to worry. 

the gp noticed i had a ""crunchy throat"" when pressing on it. he immediately sent me off to get an xray. that showed i have a perforated esophagus. that is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. the ""crunchy"" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn't be. 

to get more information i started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. 

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmc3219576/

they consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. it's so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. a few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. they said they'd read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. 

now i'm waiting on the results of the ct scan which will determine whether i get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. if i'd waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. 

tl;dr: i ate the ends off a chicken wing and now i'm in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.

**update:** a surgeon just spoke to me. i have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. they don't expect me to need surgery so that's a plus.

**update 2:** the main surgeon just spoke to me. i'll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. the critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. so i can't eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and i need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.

"by having the worst sex of my life with a complete stranger and then meeting her mom right afterwards. this actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. in 2016 i started using tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. i had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. my profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of ""not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices"" and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. 

fast forward to march of 2017 and i matched with someone. after a couple of one-off messages that don't really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. a couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. this all sounds great. except for two problems.

the first problem is that i have a beard in all of my photos. and even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. my facial hair is like if someone shaved a guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. if i grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. wiry and sparse. it's not good. for six years, i'd still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it's shorter. but for some reason, the week before we started talking, i had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. i just wanted to know what it looked like. the answer? not. fucking. good. at this point, i was 27 but still looked young for my age. shave the beard off and i look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. really fucking awkward.

so i pulled up to her house and text before i got out of my car to say, ""hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it's just me."" luckily, she's not as turned off by my baby face as i expected. all good so far.

i went inside and we end up hanging out all night. she cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. she was blown away by the fact that i'd never seen labyrinth and demanded we watch it. we ended up watching three movies that night. for labyrinth, i was about five feet away on the couch. for young frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. for the third movie (which i can't remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. and this is where the second problem comes in. 

after my breakup in 2016 and realizing i'd been battling lifelong depression, i started taking antidepressants. one of the super fun side effects of ssris is that it can be really hard to climax. like, try as you might, nothin. dust. moths. nothin. thanks, big pharma.

and so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like ""holy fuck i might have a heart attack. why are my ears ringing so loudly?"" and ""what about this position?"" ""ouch!"" ""oh my god, i need a towel. so. much. sweat. i can't see."" we were in the basement on a large three piece couch. you know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. well at one point i tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. a bruised ass. a bent dick. a lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. 

if this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven't done any cardio in your fucking life. and jesus christ the sweat. so fucking slippery and gross. this wasn't 'golden light streaming through the windows and we're both glistening' sweat. this is bog monsters come to life sweat. this is ace ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. at one point our chests become suction cupped together. i could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn't felt like it was going to explode. and the chafing. fuck. no matter how ready either of y'all are when you start out, after two hours, it's gonna wear off. we both felt like we'd attacked our bits with sandpaper. my poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn't make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. this was no climactic movie sex scene. this was a john waters film come to life. 

well, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. it's obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we're ahead and no one has died. we went outside for a smoke and at this point it's about 6am. i'm wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she's only in a bathrobe. we sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (she had just moved back home before finding a new place). so not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now i get to meet her mom for the first time! great! i'm definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. life is fucking weird.

well, the reason i am posting this on march 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we're engaged to be married on march 14th of 2020. our sex life is far better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. i mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. 

tl;dr i met up with a tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. now we're engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.




edit: just jumping in to say, holy shit y'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! i am still wholly undecided if i will ever show her this post. it's one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it's another to tell the whole internet. we'll see though. and thank you so much for the gold and silver! did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. and for those asking, i've changed my dosage on my ssri and haven't really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! and also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. he didn't pan out. within three months, her mom got hit up by several tinder guys claiming to be part of the ""oil business"" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. tinder can be amazing and terrifying...

edit2: i guess now i probably have to show this to my fiancee to which she will reply, ""i have no idea what any of that means. good for you, i guess?"" i still love her.

edit3: a few of y'all keep asking, ""why in tifu?"" well, let me tell ya, if i had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. even worse than my breakup the year before. not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? yeah, that sucked. just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn't suck asssss on the whole. i mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. thanks for coming to my tedtalk

final edit: for real y'all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. i told her about this post when i got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when i read it to her. we spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift drive-thru theater setup",4

"by kicking my son!. this happened a few weeks ago.

my ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, ""dad! kick me!""

so i did.

hear me out, please. the kick was a 3/10 on firmness. not gentle, but not painful. he's a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he's an only child, i feel like i need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. i also want him to ""lose some battles"", and to learn to ""roll with the punches"". 

anyway... i performed a front kick whilst making the bruce lee noise. i trust that you know the one. 

my son recoiled. he looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. he didn't cry,, but it was close.

he blurted out ""i said kiss me!!!""

oops!



tldr; i misheard my son, which resulted in me kicking him.",4
"serious i (26m) can't handle being a single parent. should i give my daughter (3f) up for adoption?. my girlfriend passed away two years ago unexpectedly. it was all far to quick for me to process. we were both estranged from our parents. it was hard work raising our child together but we were happy. i just can't cope anymore. i'm finding it too difficult to raise a child on my own. i work all day with two different jobs, most of that going on childcare. i spend maybe a few hours a day with her before i put her to bed. i'm ashamed to say, i don't know if i want her. i love her but i just can't handle all this pressure on my own.

if anyone has been in a similar situation, i would love to hear what you have to say.

edit: thank you for all the comments and replies. i am so grateful for all the support. the advice you have provided is amazing.


> it really looks like op is only considering this for financial reasons.

i'm in debt because of i can't afford to provide the basic necessities for my daughter. i live off paychecks and take cash in hand jobs. i skip meals. i don't regret any of it. i would take a bullet for her. this is a really hurtful comment. i just want her to have a better childhood than i did.

edit:
 > i'm ashamed to say, i don't know if i want her.

i want to clarify this. i don't know if i will be a good dad. i'm not the model dad. no real education and a criminal record to my name. i think i'm still depressed and i can't get over the fact that my other half is not here with me. i am going to act on the advice and get some therapy. however, i am still not sure if i can raise her.",8

"the body acceptance movement should be about height, not weight.. you can control your weight, but you cannot control your height. if you have weight problems you should try and help them. i can't tell you how to live your life but you shouldn't accept something that could greatly shorten your life if you can use hard work and determination to solve it. i've learned to accept my height. i can't change it, so why stress about it? i can't change girls' preferences, so i just have to live with it because there's nothing i can do about it. weight, that's a different story


edit: a lot of people are saying ""why not both"", but the answer is in the post. being obese has a direct correlation to disease and living a shorter amount of time, so i feel like it shouldn't be accepted (with the exception of metabolic diseases that cause obesity)

also i would like to add that pretty much anything you can't change like your skin color and face should be a part of it too. i have to thank some people in the comments for opening my eyes on that opportunity. the reason i chose height is because i personally feel like short people get shit on possibly more than anything else. if you think that's bullshit, scroll down and you'll see countless comments of people calling me ""manlet"", ""incel"", and ""midget""",6
"vanilla coke is the best flavor, even better than the regular flavor of coke.. to begin, what the hell even is the flavor of regular coke? sugar? it's indiscernible and, frankly, a little bland. all you really get with the base flavor is fizz. 

with the vanilla flavor, however, the whole soda gets creamier, smoother, with a flavor you can notice and a sweet after-taste reminiscent of buttercream frosting. the whole drink gets less harsh to swallow, not to mention that vanilla and whatever the base flavor is *work*. like, really well.

in fact, they work together *so* well that the combination could be it's own soda, because it has it's own taste, unlike cherry or orange coke (which just taste like regular coke with fruits shoved in them).  

the only real downfall to vanilla coke is that it's not wide-spread; only two stores in my town sell it, which is a huge shame considering how much of a blessing vanilla coke is.

"my wife cheating on our 10 year anniversary. tl;dr yesterday was our 10 year anniversary. brought flowers to wifes office. found some guy nuzzling her neck and her giggling.

yup. tl;dr  says it all. my (35m) wife (35f) and i were married ten years ago yesterday. she has been working on a big project for the last few months. the last 4 weeks or so she has been putting in extra time, staying late going in early, to finish up by deadline. this is a career maker for her.

 i work construction. with the rain we have had we have crazy hours trying to make up time that we missed. so i work 12 hrs on the days its nice, sometimes a little longer. if its raining when i get up i dont go in. somedays we get sent home when it starts, too dangerous. i usually hit the gym for an hour or two. thursday we started at 6am ,midmorning starts to rain hard. we go home. i go to the gym as usual. i cut the workout short and head downtown to see wife mehgan, to give her flowers and make plans for dinner that night if possible. we really havent seen much of each other this week. i went to bed about 9pm she wasnt home, called earlier me she is working late. not unusual for past month. 

i stopped and got some flowers and went into her building about 12:30. nichole was at the receptionist desk. i told her i got here later than i wanted could she put the flowers on mehgans desk. she said ""i dont think they went to lunch yet why not drop them off yourself?"" she buzzed the door to get back to the offices. the place was deserted. i went to her office, the door was closed . i always walk in unless the receptionist tells me she is in a meeting. i walk in some guy is standing behind her nuzzling her neck, she is reaching back over his head. she is giggling only as she can. saying""we got to get this done"".  i am gut punched. i slammed the flowers down said ""happy anniversary"" and walked out. i didnt hear what she said just went past nichole said goodbye and left. made it to elevators and out the building then my phone started ringing.

i balled my eyes out all the way home. went into garage pulled my camping gear out of the rafters and took off. i drove about 2 hours to a state park. i had no idea what to do . i just had to run. i hiked a trail we  have been on in the past about a 3 hour hike. i dont drink much so i had no booze, i just sat there thinking. looking back i am glad i was in a rush, normally i bring a 45cal. with me camping, we have black bears, which generally scare off, but get aggressive if hungary or cubs around. the way i was feeling i might have ate the barrel that night. my phone was blowing up fom mehgan so i had turned it off. i left the park to get reception turned it on to see my good friend called. i called him back. he said meghan called him to check on me, make sure i didnt do anything stupid. we talked a bit, told him i got to think this thru, would catch up on friday.

so while i am thinking about this, i go over our marriage from the beginning to see what i missed. we come from completely opposite backgrounds. my grandfather raised me with my mom. he taught me about life. he had a little saying about everyhing. he told me marriage would be the hardest job zi ever had, you had to work on it everyday. god i miss him. we did not have much,heard mom and grandpa having many discussions about bills. they worked hard and my brother and i did not miss out on anything we knew of.

mehgan was born into money. not overly rich but very comfortable. went to a great college, always great clothes, new car etc. and she is beautiful 11/10 beautiful. i would joke with her if she coughed about the silver spoon getting stuck in her throat.  we met hit off started dating. i was dumbfounded how such a woman would ever be with me. we dated quite awhile before she told me about her parents and life style. our friends called us the model couple, because they thought we were so good looking we had to be models. families were not as kind, afraid of the differences economically would come into play. her dad and i started to get along but her my mom took some convincing. 

she graduates gets her first job, we plan on getting married. we work out between us that we would expose each other to our lives that we live. i took her white water rafting, she took me to the symphony, we went ziplining, we went to an art opening etc. we agreed we had to experience the others interests. she was really enthused about the more physical things we did. i kinda like the symphony and such. i own two tuxes now.

i look back and do not see any red flags. her first two jobs she quit because the men all tried to get in her pants. she was paraded out in front for photo ops. invited to conferences when other newbies were not. at dinner at a conference a partner tried to get her drunk, then tried to force himself into her room that night. she quit, the next job the same thing, quit again . this 3rd job has women as some of the partners and none of that bs is in her workplace. she seems very happy. we seemed very happy. 

so now, friday, i am home. i called her. asked where she was, back at work. i being in a smartass mood said that the marriage is taking second place to her job. she responded since i would not talk what was she to do? fair enough. she will be home in an hour. so i wait. i want to save our marriage. if i am lacking in providing then i want to fix it. i want to ask why of course but i can not accept  a idk answer. how do i phrase this? what else should i be asking? i know i will get all emotional and forget everything so over the next few days we will be going over and over this.  what she did is wrong but please no degrading comments, she is still my wife. thank you in advance.",8

"girlfriend's little brother used my collection of '64 kennedy half dollars to buy drugs. my girlfriends little brother is 19 and not going to college or doing anything except smoking weed and playing video games. he lives with us (we are both late 20's and have ft jobs).

i have been stacking 1964 kennedy half dollars for ten years now. for those that don't know, they have a face value of $0.50 but they are made of 90% silver and so they are actually currently worth about $6 each.

i had 200, which means that his dumbass only got $100 worth of drugs yet essentially stole $1200 from me.

i insist that my girlfriend pays me back the $1200 because that is the current value in silver like i mentioned. whereas she is arguing that she only owes me $100 because that's what her brother thought he was stealing. and according to her ""he only got $100 of weed so that's fair"". okay so then what about my $1100 on top of that? what then?

she also called my silver stack ""useless and paranoid and stupid"". i collect them partially for a store of value incase of inflation or deflation, but i also just enjoy looking at them and the hobby of it.

i guess i'm looking for opinions on if she should pay the full $1200 that they're worth for the value of silver. it also seems like she is trying to make me out to be a conspiracy theorist who is hoarding silver for the end times. which is sorta true lol but what would that change anyways?",8

"during my first surgery as a 3rd year medical student. 
i'm a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship ""assisting"" on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. in this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. if you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. as this was my first laparoscopic surgery, i soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. like many of you, i had no idea this role even existed, but i quickly accepted my new job as 'vagina sealer'. i approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. i placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. after several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  the attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said ""do you know where the vagina is? get that stopper out of her ass!""

"for insulting a girl's weight after she went off on me for touching her purse on a crowded train?. train is packed, it's hot, i'm tired and looking for a place to sit. everything was occupied, but at one point i see an old lady get up and start making her way to the doors. i went over to sit in new place, but found a purse in it instead, belonging to the girl in the window seat. i asked her if she could move the purse, but she didn't respond. i noticed she had headphones in, so i figured i'll just pick up the purse and hand it to her as i'm sitting down.

as soon as i touched that thing, she went off on me with the most disgusted look and tone, asking me what the fuck i was doing. i explained. she then had the nerve to lie that she was keeping the seat for her friend. i told her i knew for a fact she was alone because i just saw the old lady get up, to which she did not respond. so i started making my way down, forcing her to pick up her purse if she didn't want it crushed under my ass.

this released an even bigger tirade and series of ""what the fuck is your problem""-s. i saw another old lady looking for a seat and approaching ours, so i figured i'd had enough petty bullshit, turned around to the girl - who was slightly overweight - locked eyes with her and told her ""oh i'm sorry, i didn't realize you actually needed two seats to be able to fit. my bad, i'll get up now"". i got up and offered my seat to the old lady, who took it with a smile, seemingly ignoring the huge shitstorm that was spewing out of the girl's mouth as i was walking away.

jack celebrated his birthday in september, and as many of you suggested, i told him that i'm sorry but my gift for him was shipped late and would be arriving in two weeks. that way it didn't look like kim made me do it, and the two of them had time to enjoy kim's gift. 

kim thanked me for understanding her situation and said she is grateful that i was gracious about her request even though we don't have the best relationship. it's flattering to read that so many of you think that joe and i are good people, but of course we aren't perfect and it took a lot of time for us to be in a civil place with kim. it was humbling for kim to ask me what she did and it also took a lot for me to let her have it. hopefully this is the beginning of a better relationship for the three of us. 

for those who are asking, i didn't put a lot of specific details in my post because i wanted to minimize the risk of being identified by someone i know in real life who might also be participating in this forum. but since a commenter in my original post already figured it out, yes, i bought jack a horse. my family has a horse farm so 'where can you hide a horse for two weeks' is thankfully not a problem. 

jack already met his new partner last week and he is very happy with him!

"my(23f) boyfriend(25f) left me on the side of the road and i deserved it.. my amazing, beautiful boyfriend had decided to treat me to dinner since we'd both had long weeks. he was making me laugh and we were talking and having a really good time. after we were done we left, and we were about half way home when i asked him if we could stop and get some dessert. he said something like ""haha, didn't we just eat?"" and keeps driving. my stupid, selfish self pushes it and says ""c'mon, please? i want something sweet."", he replies that we have ice cream at home and continues driving. after that i kept on pushing it and pushing it and pushing it, and while he's being way more patient with me than i deserve, he's firm and says no. i give up, but then i see a fast food restaurant up the road and jokingly pull the wheel to go into the parking lot. apparently i pulled harder than i thought because we actually ended up swerving, and hit another car lightly. to make things worse, he just bought this car. the driver motions for us to pull into the parking lot, and when we do he and my boyfriend get out, and the driver starts cussing him out and saying horrible things to him, even though there wasn't any damage to both the cars (the bumper has the littlest little dent on it, and the other car had no damage). they didn't even exchange any information. while he's being yelled at, i don't get out of the car and let him be punished for something i did. when he gets back in and starts driving, he's gripping the steering wheel so hard that the veins on his arms are popping out. his entire face is red and he hasn't said anything to me. to try and break the tension a little, i say ""well, that could've gone a lot worse."" as soon as i say that, he stomps on the breaks and just tells me to get out of his sight, in the angriest voice imaginable. i've never felt afraid of him, but in that moment i did. he looked like he was struggling not to hurt me. i got out and he sped off. it was starting to get dark and i was in a stretch of woods. it took almost an hour for me to walk home, but when i got there him and all his stuff was gone.

i feel so horrible. i cant even apologize to him because he hasn't been responding to my calls and texts. we've had fights before about my childish quirks when they go a little bit too far, and now i don't have a boyfriend anymore because of it. i've been getting texts like ""wtf"" and ""what the hell is wrong with you"" from our friends so i think he's told them what happened.

"my childhood ""friend"" went through my boyfriend's phone and found pictures of him having sex with me while i was sleeping. she told everyone and now my boyfriend is being ostracized from our friends. except it was my idea for him to do it in the first place. nsfw. update here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/czqc2i/update_my_childhood_friend_went_through_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

throw away because of the sensitive subject matter.

so, there are three main players in the situation; my childhood friend, sarah 31f, my long-time partner, john 34m, and myself 29f.

i've known that sarah has had a crush on john for a long time. it's kind of an open secret in our group that no one talks about, but other than some longing looks and awkward interactions, sarah has never crossed any boundaries. but because she does have this crush, she does stuff such as leaning over his shoulder to look at his phone screen and doing that playful shoulder slap that people do.

(my boyfriend and i had discussed it and decided, together, not to address it unless her crush became a problem since it seemed harmless.)

apparently when she was doing that recently, she caught a glimpse of what looked like a photo of him having sex with me, so later, she went back and went through his gallery. 

which is *full* of photos and videos of him having sex with me while i'm sleeping. she took photos with her phone and then went and told everybody - except me!!! - that my boyfriend is assaulting me in my sleep. she apparently showed them her ""evidence"" as well.

i found this out the next day when another friend messaged me, incredibly concerned.

now people are threatening to go to the cops, trying to stage interventions, and someone even told my dad i'm being abused.

but here's the thing - it's **my** fetish in the first place, not his. he took the photos and videos *for me*. the day after our ""sessions"", he sends them to me so i can watch them because it's better than porn. 

but nobody believes me. they're accusing me of protecting my boyfriend and covering for a r*pist. i don't know what to do. i'm scared that someone is going to call the police on him. 

how do i fix my friendships and convince everybody that **i'm** the one who wanted it? 

there is no text communication to exonerate my boyfriend, but i do have pages of internet history from my phone full of ""limp porn"" and sleeping fetish fantasy literature. i'm tempted to pull up my internet history and air my dirty laundry to fix this.

please help. i'm so embarrassed, frustrated, and, honestly, really, really fucking mad.

edit: since this needs to be said, yes, my boyfriend *does* have a passcode on his phone. it's a four digit code.

edit edit: 

- yes, i *know* she isn't my friend, which is why ""friend"" is in quotes.

- i have three friends on my side with this, so it's not *everybody*. just *mostly* everybody. i was upset and generalizing last night.

- i am in the us.

- my boyfriend **does have a passcode** on his phone. seriously. stop blaming him. this is *definitely* not his fault.

edit again since people just wanna try to blame my boyfriend and i: we attended a bbq where everybody left their phones inside. we *thought* we were in a trusted, safe place. 

you guys are being a little mean about this.

**edit** (again): 

went to the police and will update when i can.

## minor update 

i went to the police last night, alone. after everything that was said, i was nervous about having john with me, just in case *my consent* wasn't enough for them.

really. y'all made me nervous.

i went in and told the police that pornographic videos of me were taken from my boyfriend's phone by a woman and then distributed around to two dozen people.

at first, the officer at the window was like, ""i think that's a crime? maybe? i've gotta call my supervisor.""

that happened twice before the police were like, okay, this might be a civil suite, but we don't know. we're going to take an information report and send an officer to speak with her to ask her to delete the photos and videos. 

i gave my report and left. about fifteen minutes later, i got a phone call from the local pd. they told me that they thought my boyfriend might be the victim of a ""sexploitation crime"" based on my comments.

my comments being that sarah has a vested interest in breaking apart my relationship to sexually pursue john and this interest was probably the reason she stole the videos in the first place.

they suggested finding a lawyer since law enforcement apparently has a shaky grasp on the laws in my state. well, they told me that just in case it *was* a civil suite, i'd have a lawyer retained, and said lawyer could send a cease and desist.

so, that's about it. 

a bunch of hemming and hawing and i don't knows. they'll ""attempt"" to get the videos deleted, but cannot seize the phone without a warrant. 

i'm moving forward with both this and a social media announcement today.",8

we had a lot of talks but the chances of something like this happening again felt high. so, i decided to break off this relationship as the whole ordeal took a mental toll on both of us. no clue about her intentions though, but i am at a much better place. thank you reddit!",8
"girlfriend's work place is firing her for drinking too much water. fl. my girlfriend, type 1 diabetic and has a heart condition called dysautonomia where her doctor requires her to drink above 120 ounces of water a day. sometimes she can get dizzy and fall over however only for a couple seconds. my girlfriend isn't a quitter, she is very out going and won't use her conditions in the wrong way. she's also only 16 and she got a phone call from her manager explaining that she will most likely be let go. she told her that she should be able to go 4 hours without water and said she isn't entitled to water while working.

edit: she's job hunting now and quitting soon. thanks for all the comments and people reaching out. the place is a small 7 person business so theres no one above the owner.",2
why don't american shops just add tax to price tags so everyone knows what the actual price is?. english here.. i don't understand this.. america has a really over-the-top customer service culture so why not just change a few customer-facing systems (price-tags basically) to make everyone's lives easier?,7
"told that my eight hour shift is now thirty six hours and i'll be fired if i fall asleep. washington. like the title says. i work at a 24-hour post as a security guard and we are majorly understaffed. 

i showed up at 2pm expecting to work 2-10 and another 2-10 tomorrow. 

my boss tells me there was a call-off and could i please show up at 10am tomorrow to work 10-10. i agreed. 

my boss went home and called me two hours into my shift to tell me my relief would not be showing and that he couldn't find a replacement. 

i told him i could either work overnight or pull a 12 tomorrow, but i cannot work 32 hours straight and safely drive home. 

i also have a medical condition i need to take medication for and a missed dose will give me debilitating withdrawal symptoms. 


my boss informed me that he was going to bed and would be turning off his phone. 


it's 11:30pm and i've tried contacting everyone up the chain. nobody has so much as an estimate as to when i can go home- they're all asleep or punting the problem to someone else (who is asleep). 

if i leave, i'll be fired. if i fall asleep, i'll be fired. 

what's my best move?

(edited for spacing)

edit: it turns out what my bosses are doing isn't illegal but i seriously doubt they'll fire me when it means they'll be down three workers instead of two. 

i've informed the only person i can reach (my direct supervisor) that i'll be leaving at a set time, whether they've found a replacement or not.

second edit: i got my supervisors spoken permission to go home and take my meds/eat, and unspoken permission to curl up on the dirty floor someplace off camera to sleep. 

job hunt starts tomorrow. 

thank you everyone for your help.

final edit: i'm home and i've slept, had a good meal and taken my meds. my next shift isn't for a couple days. 

i'm completely overwhelmed. thank you everyone so much for your support. 

i'm going to be speaking with my family's lawyer about what we can do. 

the medication i'm taking is not methadone or suboxone, but best wishes to everyone who dmed me looking for solidarity in fighting that battle. i have close family members struggling with addiction as well and it's one of the hardest things anyone can do. 

please please please stop dming me to ask who i work for and where i'm working- i understand the concern but i don't want to dox myself more than i already have.",2
"for serving a pregnant woman a non-alcoholic cocktail?. i have waited tables for the last three years.

during my shift last night, a group of four women in their late 20s came in. they were a pleasure to have as customers. they ordered four of our house cocktails to start with and then went over the menu for their entrees. 

when i was on my way back to their booth with the drinks on a tray, i walked by the back side and overheard one of them talking about how she was 14 weeks along. when i rounded back, they were talking about the same topic and it was clear to me that she was pregnant. i figured her having one drink wasn't a big deal. they ordered their entrees and i went off to handle other tables.

about five minutes later, they called me over again and asked for another round. at this point i started getting concerned, but i took the order and cheerfully said i'd be right back. this time, i went to the bartender, and asked him to make one of them a virgin cocktail. he was confused but since he's a good friend of mine, i told him to just trust me. 

a few cocktails later (hers strictly virgin) they started getting rowdy, and mrs. pregnant woman was also getting into it. i figured that since she didn't notice, things were ok. the problem came when i took them their check, and they asked to split the bill at the register. when mrs. pregnant woman got to the counter, i saw her cocktails were marked with (virgin). my bartender had edited each in the system for inventory.

it was too late for me to edit them back, so i just had her pay, hoping that she wouldn't look at the receipt. they all thanked me and left, leaving a generous tip in the process. they were talking in the parking lot for the next short while, presumably waiting for an uber.

several minutes later mrs. pregnant woman came back and asked what (virgin) on the receipt meant. i fessed up that it meant non-alcoholic. she blank stared me for a few seconds and then asked if she had ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail. i said no, but told her that i assumed she wanted one seeing as she was pregnant. it was a lame lie and i'll admit it, but she looked me in the eye and asked me to return her part of the tip. i did so. then she talked to my manager. my manager took me into her office and literally shrieked at me until hoarse. 

i stood my ground and told her that i'm not going to be responsible for fas. she told me that she was taking me off the calendar until she decided what to do with me. she also informed me that i could get the restaurant in serious trouble for discrimination, and upon examination of my state's laws, she is correct. 

but when i talked to my mother and father about it tonight, they told me that they understood my position. the entire staff at the restaurant is against me and i think that i'm going to call in and tell my manager that i quit, but i still feel in the right here. i would like some perspective on this and if i'm the asshole here.",3
"if i called off my wedding because my fiance does not want my son to bring his boyfriend to the wedding?. my son was born when i was only 15 years old, and i've been a single dad since i was 18. it was hard living for a long time money-wise but i always tried to do best by my son. today i own my own gym and my son is now 22 and going to college and works at my gym full-time. he came out to me when he was 14 years old and i've always been supportive of him and his identity. 

i've been with my fiance now for about 2 years and while she does come from a very deep religious and conservative family, she has never had any issue with my son â at least nothing she has ever expressed to me. my son has been dating his boyfriend since he was 18 and i've gotten to know him really well. however my fiance told me recently that she does not want my son's boyfriend to come to the wedding nor does she want her parents to even get the inclination that my son is gay. that if they found out, they would have a complete fit. this really bothered me because i refuse to ask my son to go back in the closet. what is going to happen in the future? when my son gets married himself? will they want him and his husband barred from other family events? he's my son and will be the best man and it would be unfair to deny him a plus one because her family has an issue with gay people. when i told her this, she got very angry with me and told me that i was being selfish and over-dramatic â that it would just be for this one day, that she wants the perfect wedding. i told her that this was unacceptable and that i was not going to ask my son not to bring his boyfriend. it's my wedding too and i was his boyfriend there. 

after that i got the silent treatment for a day and since then it hasn't been discussed again. however, it has left an extremely bad taste in my mouth and has me contemplating calling the wedding off. i do not want to marry into a family that would potentially discriminate against my son. i love my fiance very much but my son will always come first. i told my brother and he said that i was being the asshole here â that it would just be for one day and that since my son is an adult, it's unlikely that he would have that much interaction with his ""step grandparents"" in the future anyway. i still don't feel comfortable about the entire situation and am really thinking about calling the wedding off. would i be the asshole if i did this? am i being unreasonable here?",3

"ne & co my mom wants to have me ""repossessed"" from college and taken home by force over state lines. can she do that?. for some backstory, my mom is a very controlling and rather horrible person. she has absolutely no tolerance for my sense of privacy, and it's gotten worse since i've moved out for college. she demands access to absolutely everything i have. this will be important later.

&#x200b;

i'm 18 years old, and i'm a college freshman. i go to college in colorado, but i was born and raised in nebraska. in nebraska, you aren't a legal adult until you're 19 years old. it was hell just convincing her to let me go to college, and it was much harder convincing her to let me go to college out of state. like i said earlier, my mom is incredibly controlling and she hates it when i do things that are outside of her reach.

&#x200b;

my mom demands my passwords for everything she knows about. email, whatsapp, facebook (even though i haven't used it in years), twitter (again, relatively unused but she always checks it and bugs me about random shit that shows up on my timeline), you name it, she'll demand the password for it and threaten me with grounding and ""a good spankin'"" if i don't give it to her. in the past, i've rolled over and taken it. it was a survival mechanism more than anything. if i'd stood up to her then, there's no way she would have let me go to college. she justifies this by claiming that because i have autism, i can't tell what's right and wrong and need to be monitored.

&#x200b;

about a month ago, i changed all my passwords. sure enough, literally less than two hours later, my mom texts me, telling me that i need to give her my new passwords. i tell her no. this is where trouble begins.

&#x200b;

over the course of the past month, she's gotten very difficult and agitated with me, and tried to guilt me into giving her my passwords. she's tried to force her way into the accounts, with no success. although in the last week, things have gotten even worse. a week ago, she showed up here and i had to have her escorted out by campus police after a brief verbal altercation. that pissed her off a bunch.

&#x200b;

recently, though, as in last night, i was on a phone call with her, and she told me that she would have me ""repossessed"" by ""the goons."" i asked her to clarify and she said that because i'm still a minor in nebraska, and i'm a resident of nebraska, i have to abide by nebraska's laws and as such, i am still a minor and she can do that. i wished her good luck with that endeavor, trying to act like i wasn't fucking terrified, seeing as i've been ""gooned"" (read: taken by force to a psych ward) before. it's not nice. i do not want to be gooned and taken home. i don't want to face my mother again.

&#x200b;

so the question is this: can she do that? is the fugitive slave act not dead after all? does my having autism change the circumstances any? if all else fails, what can i do to protect myself?",2
"i m 32 ruined christmas and i have no regrets.. is anyone else's family this dysfunctional? every year there is an argument in my family and after 32 years i was the one who blew up for the first time. 

long story short, i'm half-korean/half-white. my mom is korean. my dad side is white. so we only have my dad's side here in the us. for years, i watched my some of my dad's side speak down to my mom. they never invite her to things. me and my brother have always been treated like outsiders by some family members. to be frank, i don't care how i'm treated. every year, we always bite our tongues and survive the holidays because it's only 2-3 times a year. we repeat the process and don't expect much from these family members. my mom even buys gifts every year for these family members, she gets nothing in return and never complains. my white grandma is 80 and she's the only thing anchoring us to some of these family members.

three times today i watched a family member (aunt) raise her voice to my mom, speak to her as if she doesn't speak english and shut her down over simple questions like ""where should i sit?"". i watched my mom quietly recoil and i couldn't stand to see it again. this aunt does it the most and i finally blew up. i yelled so loud everyone stopped what they were doing. i told them enough is enough, to start treating my mom with respect and as an equal in this house. to stop speaking to my mom (who's lived in the us for 35 years) like she doesn't speak english and stop shutting her down over simple questions. i watched it happen year after year and will not allow it to happen anymore.  

my aunt stomped away and was so upset she left. as she was leaving i walked up to my aunt to hand her my mom's yearly gift to her. i said  ""for 30 years i watched my mom give you a gift every year. i watched her speak to you as an equal with respect. i've never seen you treat her with the same"".  she didn't say anything but before she left, she apologized to my mom. 

before i left, i apologized to everyone and explained why i was upset. everyone was shocked how mad i got. i felt like everyone understood why i was mad.  prior to this (around thanksgiving) i spoke to some family members about how i was hurt they never included my mom on family things or even texts about family emergencies. which they have been trying to do more. 

after blowing up, it made things awkward. people trickled out early too. now my grandma is talking about not doing christmas anymore due to the constant family drama. i feel bad, but i've never felt so proud to stand up for my mom. does anyone have any advice on this? handling rude family?  should i do something else? 


edit 12/26/2018: typos, wordiness and update below

mom's reaction: on the car ride home my mom expressed some words about my aunt which she never does about anyone. she's always taken the high road it's a very korean christian mom approach. my mom's method of being a pacifist is very much an older immigrant/korean/boomer approach too. it's taught me a valuable skill in life. i don't regret picking my battles and that's why i'm so appreciative of being korean/white. after we left, she gave me a very long mom hug. she didn't say anything and asked me if i wanted my favorite korean dish. 

where is my dad: he was in the other room. yes, my dad could have done more over the last 35 years. he's gotten in arguments with everyone my whole life including this aunt. we'd be fighting every year with someone new if we didn't pick our battles. we would have stopped going years ago but mom wants to go out of respect for my grandma. my dad is the only one who isn't petty about dumb shit. defending my mom is everyone's responsibility not just my dad. including my grandma, aunts, other family and me. as soon as i got loud my dad came into the room and stood guard (i can't describe it). there wasn't much for him to say or do because he didn't hear it. i was quick to unload and my aunt immediately walked away because she was embarrassed. my white side has a ""keep grandma"" happy approach which is dumb. for years my dad would be on the verge of saying things and my mom would demand that he didn't. 

me: reflecting on this as a whole. i can't believe the response. it shows you everyone has screwed up family in some way. after thanksgiving i started to speak to family one on one which has had good response. i have no relationship with this aunt. i should have pulled her aside even as the nephew who's 30 years younger. a small part of me regrets it and will be glad to sit down with her still. if she's not willing to try or work it out (like the other people responded), ""f*ck her"".  please don't use my experience as a reason to blow up on anyone. i should have tried to speak and i did what i felt was right, i don't regret it.. grandma's 80th bday is in two months.  i can't wait for that to be awkward. someone made the comment that people cant be educated until you give them a chance to be aware of their actions, which is fair. regardless people will now think twice to be rude to my mom. cheers and have a happy new years!

update 12/29/18
i wrote a letter to my aunt explaining further how i felt and i didn't want this to affect how our family gatherings. i explained for years she's treated my mom like an outsider in how she talks to my mom. i told her if she speaks to my mom a littler nicer she will get nothing but respect from me. i told her i wished i had a better relationship to tell her this years ago. i told her i want nothing in return but her to be nicer to my mom. i'm leaving how we move forward in her hands.

i called my grandma to let her know i sent a letter to my aunt to try and fix things. i told her i didn't want this to ruin our family gatherings. my grandma apologized for not saying something earlier to my aunt. i was right for standing up for my mom. also.. this was amazing, my grandma told me ""i never wanted your mom to ever feel like an outsider in our family"" 
 
tldr: after 32 years i finally blew up on a rude family member who disrespects my korean mom and feeling liberated for standing up for something i've been feeling for years. how do people handle their dysfunctional family when your last grandparent is alive. should i do something for blowing up?

"husband surprised me with a divorce, cleaned out bank accounts and shut off credit cards. how can i find an attorney with no money?. tonight when my husband got home from work he informed me he wants a divorce and will be leaving until it's done. this is not a huge surprise honestly, ever since our daughter was born we've just not been getting along. what is a surprise is it's suddenness.

i've been a stay at home mom since our daughter was born two years ago, it just didn't make sense to work and spend 90% of what i made on day-care.

so in talking to him before he was finished packing he told me ""good luck with the mortgage and bills, i've taken my money out of our bank account and turned off your card on my credit"". i would say i was shocked, but i really am not. he's very mean when he's angry and never has seemed to connect with his daughter, he wanted a boy and from the day we got the word we were having a daughter he's been distant. 

i obviously need an attorney, i logged into our bank account sure enough it's at $5. what resources can i begin looking into to get an attorney for free to help at least make him pay the bills and food until i can find childcare and a job? is there anything i can do myself with the courts that is semi quick to at least have him pay for the necessities since he cleaned out our joint account or at least money for an attorney? i understand it's all ""his"" money but we are married with a child. i don't see how he can just leave us with nothing all of the sudden.

"for possibly stealing from a convenience store multiple times and not saying anything about it.. for the last year i've had a rewards card to a local gas station chain that lets me get deals and store coupons. 


about a week ago i went into the store to get a beverage, and swiped my rewards card before swiping my debit, however after the card reader finished processing the rewards card the total due went to 0 and the cashier asked if i wanted a receipt. at this point i figured i had just used a deal i don't know about, but the next time i went the same thing happened. so the next several times i've gone i've made around 10 dollar purchases with a variety of different items, and every single time it's been free.


i'm thinking something is wrong and i should tell someone, but i kinda wanna keep getting free stuff. aita?

update: hi guys

i thought i had the golden ticket, i really did. 

i thought i had the coveted, all expenses paid, lifetime gas station experience moving forward. the rewards card that wouldn't stop rewarding. last night i dreamed about all the bags of mixed nuts, the hardest of the boiled eggs, the bottles of old orange juice, the not-so-hot dogs that have been rolling right next to the hispanic egg rolls for the last 6 hours, that were just sitting there waiting for me to get my grubby, stinky little paws on them.


i wanted to ask you fine people if i was the asshole real quick before i went balls deep and pilfered my way through a midwest convenience store chain. i'll be honest i didn't care what people said though. i was high on the fact that i had, more or less, the most power in the entire world.


after i made the post i made my daily trip to indulge in my kingdom, not caring that like 15 people on my post had just been like, ""i mean you kinda suck as a person overall like a 0/10 also your ugly and your posture is bad you need to fix that it's good for your spinal health and overall makes you feel better and more confident, but yeah you shouldn't steal""


i made my way around the store picking up every possible box of hard boiled eggs, and also grabbed an energy drink cause i was sleepy. and then i went to perform the maneuver. i strode passionately, arms filled to the brim with eggness, to the front counter.

it was a gift card. 


i had completely forgotten my giver of birth had given it to me like 2 months ago, and it had stayed hidden in my wallet until last week in a frantic, anxiety filled search for the rewards card, i found it and my dumb little brain couldn't read the text that said ""gift card"" on the bottom.

i'm not going to lie a tear or two fell when the cashier was like ""alright weirdo, there was $5.29 left on that, now you owe $43.82."" but i sucked it up and paid, and now all i have is sadness and a fair amount of protein and amino acids at only 77 calories per portion.

tl;dr i thought i had it all but now i just have a lot of eggs.

"for refusing to use the money i inherited from my mother to pay for medical treatment for my half-sister, who has a life threatening sickness? she is the child of my father and the woman he cheated on my mother with.. when i was 25, we found out that my father had been cheating on my mother for years and he had a 7 year old daughter with his mistress. in one split second, the happy family i knew was gone, and i went through the darkest time in my life.

my parents divorced and per their prenup, my mother walked away with most of their assets (since she also contributed more to the family income). she never forgave my dad for what he did and never talked to him again, though she grudgingly allowed me to have whatever relationship i wanted to have with him. i eventually forgave my dad mostly because i was tired of carrying so much anger and hurt in my heart. i talk to him but i want nothing to do with his mistress or my half sister.

my mother died last year and left me everything - her money, her real estate assets, and her business, which i now own and operate. i am in a relatively comfortable financial position, while my dad is... getting by. he was never a good businessman on his own and lost a lot of his money on businesses that later went belly up.

this year my half sister was diagnosed with a life threatening sickness, and she has been in the hospital for the last four months. the bills are mounting and my dad came to me for help because they are now in a situation where they are finding it difficult to come up with money for my half sister's treatment.

the thing is, i don't want to use my mother's money to pay for the treatment of the child her husband had with his other woman. though it's not my half sister's fault, it feels so unfair when i think that the money my mother worked hard all her life for will go to a child that neither my mother and i have any responsibility towards, and the very same child of the man and the woman who hurt her so much at that. i'd really rather use it to grow her company and let my dad and my half sister's mother figure out how to get money for her treatment. they are her parents after all. the only thing tying me to her is my father saying ""she is your sister"" and ""if she dies because she didn't get the treatment she needs, would you be able to sleep at night?""

"by telling a stranger i can't wait to fuck them tonight. disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. i only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, ""what was your most embarrassing moment?""

so i was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing i would get fully sloshed at the party. she was right.

on the way home, i ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. she pulls her light blue jeep into the parking lot, i stumble out of the jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. 

i (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. ""i can't wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.""

i was not expecting to get hit in the face. i also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming i've ever heard in my life. instinctively, i covered up my face and wondered what the hell i said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. 

the screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so i couldn't really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when i heard, clear as a bell, ""you fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.""

whoa whoa whoa instant sobriety. i uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although i was in a blue jeep, it was not my gfs blue jeep. my gfs identical blue jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman's blue jeep. 

i finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. she convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. 

i did not fuck anyone that night.

"by looking at my fiances location history and found out that she has been cheating on me.. obligatory ""this happened two days ago.""

i had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. i proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! or so i thought. 

about 3 weeks after our proposal, i notice she starts acting different. not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. she had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of m-f each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. i went to a few of these gatherings but didn't really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when i have work the next day, so i often opted out.

we would also share our google location with each other at all times. mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and i would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. i looked at her location one day and it was turned off. i texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. hadn't been a problem for the past year. she turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. she also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. i only had the location for the personal phone. eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.

two days ago, about a month after the proposal, i decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it's highest, and i just wanted to put it to rest. i used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. she had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. i called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. she said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.

i waited until she got home and confronted her about it. she said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn't want to tell me because she thought i would get mad. turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. i kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time i asked.

the next day when i got home from work, i asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. she said she deleted them. so i said i wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. i started recovering the data from the last backup. she sat down beside me while i was doing it, and asked what i was doing. i told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! so she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. i asked her one last time, ""before i look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?"" she was silent. i asked flat out ""did you sleep with him?"" and she said yes. turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. funny enough, the data recovery didn't even work. so that's a win i guess.

planning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. havn't told her yet. still can't believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. feels shitty but i'm keeping my head up.

tldr; by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. it has been one month since the proposal now.

"(va) my son stole a rare toy from my brother. my brother is refusing to take it back and is threatening to get the police involved. what do i do?. right now my brother is threatening to ""sue"" me for my son taking a figure from his collection and get the police involved. here is the story.

&#x200b;

last week my brother invited me and my family over for diner. while we were there my son asked to see my brothers collection of toys and figures. my brother has spent a good deal of money on his collection and from what i know it's one of his biggest hobbies. well, after diner we left and everything seemed normal

&#x200b;

well, until yesterday. my brother called me up furiously and told me my ""little shit"" stole something from his collection and i needed to return it immediately. i honestly was upset at this, but if my son had taken something that was wrong,especially if it was from my own brother. well, it turns out that my son slipped away during dinner and took a boba fett figure from his collection. he confirmed it because he has footage from his porch camera of him taking it out to our car.

&#x200b;

i was furious and took it from him. here is the problem though, after i confirmed with my brother it was his i found out that my son had removed it from it's packaging. apparently the figure is worth almost 2000$ in it's package and almost nothing out of it. so my brother broke down over the phone and refused to take it back before hanging up. well, he just called me again today and said he wanted me to pay for a replacement immediately or he will get the police involved and sue me. i told him i would help pay for one but not fully to which he said ""not good enough"" and hung up. 

&#x200b;

honestly, what are my options here? i can't afford to pay him back right now. if he does go the police will my son get arrested? he's only 15. it was very wrong of him to do but i think my brother is over reacting. what can i expect if he does take me to court or call the police?",2

"for being mad that my birthday gift was sex?. on my gf's birthday i gave her a necklace that i spent $400 on.  i wasn't expecting her to spend the same as me, but i was expecting something.

"because i finally learned how to wipe my butt. i asked my girlfriend the other day, ""why do the doors of the bathroom stalls have space on the bottom?""

she told me they're like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a ""duh\~"" tone.

i followed up by saying, ""but sometimes, people can see my butt.""

she started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.

so i had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; i wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.

i then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/(http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and i was shocked.

we were both curious where/how i even learned that from.

was it a potty training error? apparently not. we asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.

so, i've been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.

tl;dr

for 20 years, i squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt.",4
"bored middle age neighbor has been giving me a hard time because i dress like a ""hussy"", is that a crime?. i have been accused of a litany of sexual crimes, some against children because of the way i dress. my neighbor is so adamant about all of this she's got me a bit worried. 

about a month ago, i moved in with my sister and her boyfriend into a neighborhood that's mostly families. i didn't expect any trouble. my first introduction to this woman, let's call her karen, was my first week here. i went to check the mail and i wasn't wearing a bra. i had on a baggy t shirt and basketball shorts, though. karen is one of *those* southern women who spend all day in their yards, pretending to garden, but are really spying on their neighbors. you know the type. she waved at me and i waved back, trying to be pleasant. she came at me, i thought to make a proper introduction, or whatever, but she started lecturing me about not having on a bra.

it was creepy and weird. i am not at all well endowed, i go without frequently and so far, no one seems to pick up on it, but not karen. karen urged me to think of her children and jesus, who was always watching, and my parents (bless their hearts) she *knows* they raised me better than this. it was so goddamn weird, i felt like laughing in her face, but i didn't want there to be issues so i said i'd be more diligent in the future and karen went about her business.

well, wearing a bra wasn't good enough for karen, y'all, oh no. not only is blasting my nips lewd, so are regular women's shorts and any form fitting type of bottoms even if they cover my sinful legs. karen seems to have an issue with the lower half of my body. while my breasts are small and humble, i am ""aesthetic"" from the waist down.

the second time karen confronted me, her brood was playing in the street and any semblance of pleasantness was gone. she threatened to call the police on me for indecent exposure in front of her children, insinuated i got off on arousing her tween boys, called me a hussy, a jezebel and that i needed jesus. because i was wearing jean shorts.

we live in a nice area, lots of woods, by lakes and parks and i like to go out for walks, but it seems every time i step foot out of my door, there's fucking karen making snide remarks, outright threatening to call the police, or gossiping with other bored housewives. it's getting annoying. 

this is in florida, by the way.

edit: i got dressed up in my skimpiest daisy dukes that barely cover my ass and a legit camel toe, a half shirt with no bra on, my abs exposed to check the mail (i do not regularly dress like this) i must have been quite a sight to karen who immediately stormed over once she spotted me, nearly knocking over her lawn chair she stood up so fast. she started laying into me. i just stood there letting her bump her gums for a minute then i said ""you can stop the games, karen. i see the way you look at me, i know you want me."" her face went beet red and she stammered out, ""i'll pray for you."" then scurried away. actually went inside her house. ð",2

"for telling my son that if he changes his last name then i'm no longer his father?. let me start off by saying my son, adam, is 22 years old. back when my ex wife, tori, and i were trying for kids we found out that i was infertile. we decided we'd adopt then about 4 months later my ex wife is pregnant. i was thrilled because i thought maybe the doctor made a mistake. no, i was wrong. my ex wife cheated on me and i didn't find out until 20 years later. 

tori told me 2 years ago that she cheated on me, and we did a paternity test to make sure and well he's not my biological son. my ex and i divorced a few weeks later. ever since my son found out the truth he wanted to meet his biological father. he did and they started to become really close. it hurt me much more than i thought it would. 

he's an adult he can make his own decisions but it hurt really bad. they started to bond really well, and all of a sudden adam became really distant from me. it's been like this for almost a year and a half. i try to text him to make plans for dinner and he said he's busy with chris (biological father). i tried numerous times to connect with him by calling and texting but he never made plans aside from like a meal every other month. we used to do stuff every other week but it's been completely different since he found out about chris.

i couldn't stand it. my son who i raised since he was a baby treated me like i didn't matter. any time we'd actually have plans he would still be cold and distant. what i mean by that is became much more defensive of his personal life. i'd ask him how classes or friends were and he'd just say they were fine but never go deeper than that. he also changed his major from econ to computer science and didn't even mention it to me until a year later. 

i told him how much he was hurting me because of how distant he was and he apologized and said he'd do better. he never did. i told him numerous times and he never changed. he was still distant.

what was the final straw for me was the phone conversation i had with him last week. he said he was going to change his last name to chris' because he liked it so much and because they were close. i couldn't believe what i was hearing. i told him this ""i can't believe you are going to do this. that's really disappointing to me. if you decide to change your last name go ahead but if you do that then i'm no longer your father and i don't want to be involved in your life."" 

he hung up on me. i didn't even bother reaching out because i know he wouldn't respond. i stand by what i said. i meant every word and still do. the last name change to me means he no longer views me as a father and views chris as his (despite the fact he's 22).

my family told me i'm being unreasonable meanwhile my best friends think it's reasonable. i was told to post it here. so reddit am i being an asshole?

info: something to add. after i found out about chris i took a couple of days and didn't speak to my ex wife or adam. they didn't contact me. i didn't contact them. i needed a break.

edit 2: a lot of you are asking for a deeper meaning behind this and i think i finally figured out why he's been so cold. a few months before my wife told us the truth we were in a very long argument. his grandma (my mother) left a big inheritance for him that i am fully in charge of. enough to pay for college and have enough wiggle room to not stress all the time about it. after a semester of university he started dating this girl. he was head over heels in love with her. 

i never met the girl so i have zero clue how she felt about the relationship. suddenly after a few months of dating adam asked me for about $3k to be deposited into his account from the inheritance. i already paid for the semester so this was odd to me. i asked adam why he needed the money. he said his girlfriend was having trouble paying for paying for her tuition and asked my son to help. 

i told him no because it seemed to me that she was treating him like a piggy bank. he spent over 1k on her in just under a few months. he would constantly talk about how he loved going shopping with her so he could buy her things. to me she was just after my son's inheritance and i was right. what i said to him was basically this ""adam, you haven't been dating this girl for very long at all and for me to give you that much money just to spend on her after a few months doesn't sit well with me. that's the money your grandmother left you for your college career, not hers. if you 2 were more serious then i would think about it, but i'm not giving you that much money to just give your girlfriend."" turns out my guess was right and she was after his money. they broke up shortly after and have had an on again off again relationship ever since. 

he was upset with me but he eventually got over it after a few months. then we found out about my ex's affair. i don't know if that's the real reason he's so cold. that was a huge argument that went on for weeks until she left him.",3
"if ever you need a program you want for free (for example a video/photo editor) don't search for ""free"", search for ""open source"" to avoid limited trial versions, adverts and malware. the reasoning being if you type ""free"", generally you will be advertised to or get the lite version which will only have some of the functionality and then will be up-sold to.

open source does what it says on the tin - the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available in-full for free, occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined. 

this has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc. because open-source equates to peer-reviewed and open to be examined by anyone.

"update: hoarder in my building died with a bad cockroach infestation. building management's negligence has caused me to be financially impacted. (to, canada). link to original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/b4lk31/hoarder_in_my_building_died_she_was_infested_with/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app

first i want to thank everyone who provided me with some very solid advice that has led to a resolution my wife and i are quite happy with. i've been very active on reddit the last couple months as a means of support as stupid as that might sound and you all came through. it has been a very difficult few months for my wife and myself due to some other reasons so the cockroach problem really pushed us over the edge. i digress, as there is a happy update!!!! 

through the advice i received on this subreddit, i contacted the city and the health department right away. i was contacted almost immediately my a bylaw officer who asked me some more detailed questions. the more we spoke the more interested he became. he called and asked me ""if i were to walk by (deceased neighbours unit) would i be able to see cockroaches coming out of the door?"" to which i replied ""150%"". he then asked me when she passed and if to my knowledge there had been a biohazard cleaning team come in, i said ""no."" 

shortly after this phone call the building management sent their cleaners up to my floor to clean up all the diatomaceous earth we had put in front of my door. i went out and asked them why. they told me they were instructed to because they don't want people panicking etc. i told them they were to leave it there as i have called the city and they are on their way. they didn't seem happy. as if the whole floor isn't already in a panic anyway. literally every door now has diatomaceous earth in front of it now. i also made sure to let the bylaw officer know their solution so far has been to vacuum our floor multiple times a week with the same vacuum and then use the vacuum on other floors. i have learned now we are not the only floor with cockroaches now. this lack of care or concern about the cockroaches has just been pure negligence on their part. 

i explained to the bylaw officer that the building kept telling us they could not legally enter the apartment and do anything. according to toronto health and bylaws that is bullshit. the situation is a public health hazard and therefore my building management could have taken action sooner but for some reason chose not to. the bylaw officer on the phone gave me a pretty good understanding of how these things should work and let me tell you it is drastically different from the information i have been receiving from the building management. 

the bylaw officer became very concerned throughout the course of our phone call and said he would have to contact some people and then call me back. i heard nothing until monday. come monday morning i get a loud knock at the door from my building super saying that wednesday they are coming to completely spray and gut the hoarders apartment. they will also be spraying the hallways and likely replacing the carpet entirely. the cockroaches are also under the wall paper as well. i'm guessing whoever he called later the law down for my building management.

the city has been here everyday since and suddenly we are getting all these visits from head office claiming they had no idea how bad things were. i do not believe them at all. we have all our evidence compiled to disprove building managements claims that they ""didn't know"" and will be handing it over. from what i understand from the bylaw officer, this is going to be quite a headache for building management. now that the city and health department are involved they must produce a lot of paperwork and comply with the orders given to them with hard deadlines. i have the personal contact information for the officer i spoke with and he has been incredibly attentive and helpful. we went from ""submit a maintenance request"" to ""we are gutting the whole apartment and treating your unit immediately"" in literally 48 hours after months of fighting and stress. 

thank you so much reddit!!! i couldn't have done it without your help!! 

here is hoping the next few months continues on a more upward trajectory. ",2
"this morning i (27m) found out my gf (27f) cheated on me, where to go from here?. so our valentine's day plan was to get dinner and spend the night together but i asked my boss if i could come in late as i had some stuff i had to do. however i went to her place this morning to drop off a bouquet of flowers and another gift as a surprise. she gave me a key to her apartment and when i went in there was another guy eating breakfast while she was sitting half naked in a robe drinking tea.




as soon as i walked in she saw me and burst into tears. the guy looked like he wanted to be anywhere but there. i freaked out at first and the guy left. she kept asking what are you doing here, i thought you had to work and saying she was sorry. i tried asking her questions and she wouldn't answer. eventually she admitted she met him at a bar a couple weeks earlier, they chatted and wound up fooling around in her car and had slept together three times since then. 



i took the flowers and the gift and left. i'm sitting at work right now because if i went home my mind would be on her and thinking about whatever they were doing constantly. 





we've been together 3 years and were planning on moving in together later this year. i was looking up rings. she said it's because i was her first properly serious relationship and she has no idea why she did something so stupid and selfish. she thought i wouldn't find out and planned to end it eventually as it was just a brief fling. i asked if there were any others but she said no. idk what to believe at this point. 




the kicker is that my birthday was yesterday. we had lunch and got a hotel room together. we had dinner at my place with my folks and i dropped her off at her place around 9.30 as she said she had some stuff to finish doing before valentine's day. i trusted her for fucks sake.




 how and why the fuck do people do things like this to others? what am i supposed to do from here?



tl;dr spent valentines day morning learning my girlfriend is a cheater and the details of that cheating, sitting at work staring at my screen 




*edit at roughly 1:30pm. : i broke up with her, i told her i'll be by later to get my shit and to have it ready. i'll be taking her stuff over and giving her back her key.*

"update: i (28) think my girlfriend (26) has been using my gym socks to wipe after going to the bathroom.. &#x200b;

link to original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/avwpo0/i_28_think_my_girlfriend_26_has_been_using_my_gym/)

i've had a lot of time to think about what happened yesterday. i've also read through a lot of the comments. thank you to everyone who gave me advice on what to do. there's been a lot of development and a few requests to follow up, so here it goes. it's whatever at this point.

we had been texting off and on all evening. as promised, i agreed not to bring it up in person. when i got home after work her car was in the driveway and her sister's car was there as well. i was a little nervous not knowing what i might be walking into, but overall i just wanted to get whatever was going to happen over with. when i walked in it was clear so did she. her sister was helping her pack up her things. i didn't know what to say, but i never expected this. i honestly thought everything was going to be okay when i got home. her sister just looked at me and didn't say anything.

i walked by her sister and went into the bedroom where my girlfriend was. she didn't say anything either. she didn't even look at me. if she was going to leave i at least wanted us to have a discussion about it. everything i had read in the comments about buying a bidet and ocd lead me to believe there might be more to all of this than i had considered. i started to talk and she just threw down the hangars of clothes and screamed at me. ""you put this online? i told you to not talk about it!"" her sister ran into the room and told me to just leave until they were gone. she then accused me of cheating. what? this whole thing has been crazy and i feel like i had dealt with a lot up to this point but man that was it. i snapped.

i told her sister i had never cheated. not once. i would never cheat on her. enough was enough, so i told her sister the reason she was there was because earlier i had found out my girlfriend had been going to the bathroom and wiping herself with my socks. everything went silent. like, no one said a word. out of nowhere they both start crying. her sister stared yelling at me and told me i shouldn't be talking about things i don't understand. when i asked her what in the world she was talking about she just kept on yelling at me and shouted back that it was normal and that i need to mind my own business.

1. her sister knows about it. (she did not know i posted on reddit about it)
2. her sister thinks it's normal.
3. i need to mind my own business? they're my socks!

i stood there all kinds of messed up so i just left. i went to a buddy's house and stayed the night. i also called off work today. i went home and all her stuff is gone. i didn't text her back. i think i'm done.

to clarify a few things: she insisted on doing laundry to keep my suspicion of her not having many socks at rest. she told me last night through text she always throws away the socks and never washed them. she reaffirmed it's not a fetish. she won't try a bidet because she doesn't want poop water splashing on her. i can't keep up with the comments. i'm pooped. (i'm trying to find humor in this because i'm really upset :(

so yeah.

"for suggesting that my sister chose an easy love?. my younger sister and i were very close when young but no so much now. i was born in fairly well to do hindu family. i fell in love and married a muslim man and had to convert to his religion. my family was pretty pissed off that i converted but we've kept in touch.

recently my sister announced that she was in love with a guy she'd met while trekking and they had plans to marry. my mom invited me for a 'girl's day', just me, her and my sister at my parent's home for a fun day.

my sister began to talk about her fiance, how they hated each other at first but then fell in love etc etc. i was happy for her.

it all began when i asked what religion he was. imagine my surprise when she said that he was hindu and the same community as our parents. this would mean that it would make my father absolutely over the moon.

i asked her if she was sure she loved him, because it seemed unbelievable that she would meet someone from the same small community as our parents' and fall in love. she got angry and told me that she was absolutely sure she was in love with him. 
i suggested that maybe she thought she was in love because it was easy and there was no challenges involved.

i explained to her that if she was truly in love, she wouldn't choose someone so obviously a match. it was as though our parents chose him from a catalogue. 

she told me that it didn't matter, she loved him and thats it, and i was being rude. i told her that i wasn't, i was just looking out for her and didn't want her to bear the brunt of societal expectations on who to marry.  i then asked her if she was marrying him to appease our parents.
 
at this point my sister blew up on me and began fuming that she was not a kid, she didn't need to appease anyone etc etc. at this point my mom told me(not her) to get out of the house.


later my sister told me never to contact her again, nor ever see her face or come to her wedding. she called me 'toxic'.

i was just looking out for her.",3

"by relaxing too much during a sensual massage. bit of back story. i started talking to a guy on reddit last week. we hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. we decided to meet for a date on friday. i have ibs and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. i was also very tired.

the fu: so i'm at this guy's house and i've made us a very nice mac n cheese. there was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. we're then snuggling on the sofa and i feel a big fart brewing. i'm hoping i can just absorb it back in to my body if i hold on to it long enough. 

we start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. i choose a 'relaxing' oil. i'm naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. he starts rubbing my back, and turns out he's good at massages. i'm feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.

i then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart i have ever expelled. the fart i was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. it was hella loud and it was hella long. and it was right on his balls. it was so forceful, they vibrated.

his response was to tell me, through tears of laughter 'at least you didn't shit yourself'.

tldr: farted on a first date's balls.

"i'm so tired of reddit's uncontrollable need to be the funny man in the comments no matter how serious the post may be.. people on reddit have always had a great sense of humor to me, but sometimes the impulse to insert a joke or a pun or a series of weird strung along comments gets. fucking. old. 

sometimes the worst part about it is that it's so damn funny. and you just have to give credit where credits due. but lately i've been going to the comments expecting an informative and sincere conversation about a rather serious post only to find (yet again) another 4 pages of jokes or one drawn out and exhausted pun. sometimes i feel like i should laugh at the cleverness of some. but it happens so often and in so many posts that i find myself never laughing at all in the comments anymore. not unless there's just a golden moment. i've even begun to roll my eyes the moment i open the comments and see that the top comment is a joke. i never roll my eyes. at anything. 

i used to really connect to reddits sense of humor but lately i've been really turned off by it. maybe i just need a break.


edit: thank you for the gold and silver!  wow. this blew up... i just wanna add something to this. i'm not saying it's bad to have some fun in the comments. one of you pointed out that it's okay to be serious and to have fun. i agree. i'm saying that when i'm intrigued by a post sometimes i really want to see what the reddit community has to say about it... or to see if there's additional information in the comments. but a lot of the time all i see for miles is the repetitive back and forth joking. sometimes i really just wish the top comments had less to do with clever jokes and more to do with the content of that post...

his car was already a mess when he arrived. we would be late to the ball drop if we had chosen another ride. we were in the car for 6 minutes and had a nice conversation. 24 hours later i was charged $100. what can or should i do?

update: lyft has informed me that the evidence the driver gave was enough to close the claim indefinitely. also, the last email that they sent me said that my driver ""roy"" (not my driver) filed the claim promptly.... who the fuck is roy and where is my fucking money! 

looking in to get the info behind the photos. still no reply from lyft. used my debit card and the bank said they may be able to challenge the charge.

will update soon with photos .",2
"my favorite joke: everyone knows dave. dave was bragging to his boss one day, ""you know, i know everyone there is to know. just name someone, anyone, and i know them.""

tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""ok, dave, how about tom cruise?""

""no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it.""
so dave and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,

 ""dave! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!""

although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.

""no, no, just name anyone else,"" dave says.

""president obama,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""yup,"" dave says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go. 

at the white house, obama spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced.
after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""pope francis,"" his boss replies.

""sure!"" says dave. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.

dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope.""
he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.

sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, ""what happened?""

his boss looks up and says, ""it was the final straw... you and the pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with dave?'",0

"update: for refusing to give my newborn's social security number to my aunt.. link to a snapshot of my op(https://reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/bwoxwx/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_newborns_social/epz1kn2/)

i was able to speak with my aunt and my mother a week and a half ago. my aunt was actually still pretty upset about it and my mother still took her side. i explained why exactly i didn't feel good about giving her leyla's social security number. they both told me about how their aunts/uncles had opened accounts for them 40+ years ago for the exact same purpose and they didn't see anything wrong with it.

after explaining to them that 40 years ago you didn't have to worry much about someone stealing your identity, let alone before you could eat solid food, they seemed to understand. we ended up working out a compromise - my wife and i opened a bank account which lets both my aunt and my mother make deposits but not withdrawals, nor can they see any details about the account in their online banking portal. everything seemed to have worked out well.

yesterday, my mom called and told me her credit card company had called about a several hundred dollar charge from romania. she had the card cancelled, looked at her credit, saw a totally different credit card had been opened in her name. she said it completely justified my hesitation. her information was stolen in the equifax breach a couple of years ago.

moral of the story: trust your gut on financial matters. while my mom and aunt had good intentions in mind, you really can't be too careful these days.",3

"by sitting in the wrong class for an entire month and finding out a day before the first midterm.. i'm in my third year of university taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being ""that person"" in the wrong class. to start the semester i ended up missing the first week of school because i was on a last minute trip with my friends. it was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since i technically couldn't afford to go.

anyway, i came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. on both those days i have classes all day until 2pm so i usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. so my first tuesday home i ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. so as part of my degree i have to take microeconomics which all i knew about it previously was it's about the economy and money. when i get to class they're talking about supply and demand curves shifting so i just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.

this goes on for 3.5 weeks. i came to class. took notes. then did the weekly assignments. on the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is febuary 1st. so the class before the exam, january 30th, i decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. now i was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was all theory based while the class was heavy math based. i understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. i explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:

*explains above about material*
prof: ""what do you mean theory? all the assignments are filled with math. are you using launchpad?""
me: ""no the assignments are online. like the website we bought the textbook from. whats lauchpad?""
prof: ""pardon? i don't have a textbook for this course.""
me: ""it literally says in the syllabus, look!""
*shows syllabus*
prof: ""wait, what class are you supposed to be in?""
me: ""what do you mean...? this is econ 202 right?""
*prof starts laughing*
prof: ""haha this is econ 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. this is a new one, i've never experienced this before.""
me: ""well this is awkward. i better go see my actual teacher and explain.""

i then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. i caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. even showed him my econ 301 notes to prove i couldn't make this shit up. he just laughed and said the same thing ""this is a new one for me."" turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. same with the midterms. they were relevant because it was obviously a level above what i was supposed to be doing and the only thing i got wrong was the building code. they were both classroom 112, just different buildings. so basically i just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. wish me luck tomorrow!

tldr; i was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until i finally realized. then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. crazy coicidences all around.

edit: well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying ""you made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha"". the exam is in a couple hours and i will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:

1. ya, the trip wasn't the smartest but i had fun and went to tiesto's birthday in vegas amongst other kool stuff. life goes on.

2. i was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and i had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c'mon). so i do have a grasp of whats going on
.. kinda. he did everything on the board and there were online notes but i figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. 

3. i highly doubt i'll fail the course or the midterm. it's amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. i've made it through almost 3 years of engineering so i'm sure it will turn out fine. it'll be a funny story at grad when i get my ring.

thanks for all the support too. :) making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018's been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.

edit 2: just got back from the exam.. i didn't crush it but there is no way i didn't pass. it was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. the prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said ""i usually don't tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm i will take the average to make up that first exam."" so all in all i survived and live to fight another day.

just wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. i will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. in the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:

""literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life's over. but somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life."" - cz

"update dad left us and a decade later wants to reconcile because he has cancer. am i wrong to be angry?. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ax9pfk/dad_left_us_and_a_decade_later_wants_to_reconcile/)

you guys are right. i can't force my family to accept my views of no contact with my father. i resent this man so much. i can't stand the sight of him. 

after i posted yesterday, i was ""invited"" to have dinner with my family. to no one's surprise, my dad and his new family where there. i picked out the two most expensive dishes on the menu and we had a chat. i heard his thoughts on the matter of being an absent father but i didn't bring up any of our hardships. my mother and sister made more attempts to make me forgive him. i did, i forgave him but that doesn't mean i need to have a relationship with him anymore. again, my family protested that i'm being cruel and heartless. i'm not, many people survive cancer and his lung cancer is in the early stages. i told them i would not be present at any family events if he was there.

my sister shouted at me claiming ""he is our dad. you asshole"". yes he is, to which i replied that he needs to take over his responsibilities as a father. i told them i had cancelled the tenancy on the house and we need to move out by end of this month. my sisters need to return the iphone's that are on contract as i am cancelling those. driving lessons will be cancelled, gym membership will be cancelled, subscription services will be cancelled and everything else that i pay for. these are dad's responsibilities now. ate my dinner and left them the with bill as a little act of petty revenge.

i have been staying with my girlfriend and have not answered any texts and calls from them. i need a break.

i'm done. i'm done taking over dad's role. i'm done with the financial responsibilities or acting as the parent. i'm 25 and i need to live my own life now. i don't think this will burn bridges. it's just a wake up call for them.

"i (21f) found a hidden camera in my house. i suspect my sil (26f) put it there to watch me while i babysit my nephew (1m). what do i do?. i babysit my 1 year old nephew from 7am-8pm mon-fri for free because a) i love my brother and nephew and b) i'm already a sahm for my 5mo daughter and adding another kid isn't a big deal for me, i have everything he needs already at home and i love kids. 

the spare room in my apt has been transformed into a playroom with floor mats, exersaucers, toys, a nap cot, etc and that is where my daughter and nephew spend most of their time playing and napping. there is also a tv in there, and today semi hidden behind the tv i found a weird circular object with a lens in it. after some googling i found that it was a small hidden wifi enabled camera that live streams to an app. i flipped my shit, called my fiance and asked him if it was his. he vehemently denied it and suggested i called the police and explain to them that i need a bug check. the only other person with regular access to my home and the playroom in particular would be my sil; she drops nephew off in the morning and picks him up after work, and bro and our parents only come on the weekends. i suspect the camera was placed recently which rules them out. another reason i suspect sil is because i had put my nephew in a long sleeved foot pajama this morning because my apartment can get chilly, and 5 mins later she texted me ""it's going to warm up later so please don't dress (nephew) too warmly, thanks!"" it could be a coincidence, but now that i found the camera i'm not so sure.


if it's her, she knows i know since i'm assuming she saw me find it. what do i do? do i confront her and ask if its hers? i couldn't even begin to imagine why she would think to put hidden cameras in my house; i have treated my nephew like my own from the start and love him wholeheartedly. i would never think to hurt him or neglect him, my family actually compliment me quite often on what good care i take of my daughter and how happy she always is, and of course i treat my nephew the same.",8

"for kicking out my brother, who our parents have previously disowned, because he told my (now ex) fiance that i cheated 9 years ago?. for reference, my brother connor is 19, i am 26, and my (now ex) fiance hunter is 28. also for reference, already mentioned in the title, but my brother was kicked out when he was 16 because our parents snooped through his phone and found out he was in gay.

connor had a birthday last weekend, so he invited his friends over and they were all (18-22 year olds) drinking and playing games. hunter and i were about to head out to let them have the place to themselves, when connor asked if we wanted to join them. i initially refused (bit too old to be playing drinking games), but he insisted and hunter thought it'd be fun to act like college students again.

we all got pretty drunk and connor had the idea of playing never have i ever. a few rounds in, the statement ""never have i ever cheated before"" came up.

now's a good time to mention that hunter is **staunchly** against cheating. his ex-fiance cheated on him and it emotionally wrecked him. and unfortunately, as a lot of dumb, immature 17 year olds do, i cheated on my ""boyfriend"" of 5 months. it was a stupid mistake, he found out, and (understandably) ended things. this was almost a decade ago, i obviously learned my lesson, and look back at that time with shame (and obviously never cheated since).

well my brother knows about this so when i didn't drink, he went ""hey sis, what the hell? you know you cheated on (*insert ex's name*). you have to drink to that!""

my boyfriend paused, looked at me, looked at him, and just walked out of the room. i followed him and tried to talk to tell him that it was a stupid teenaged mistake, but he wasn't haven't any of it and ended things on the spot. i'm numb. i'm heartbroken. he was my everything and more and i still don't know how i'm going to move on.

connor tried to apologize, but i feel nothing but sadness and emptiness. this morning i served him an eviction notice. he begged me to stay and said he didn't mean to ruin my relationship and he just didn't think when he said those words. i just can't look at him right now. he ruined my life. after i raised him and cared for him like he was my own. i feel so hurt. am i being unreasonable?",3

"if you get a kitten, do use your hands for play so you can teach restraint when they are too rough. restraint is naturally learned in play with hands and littermates because the fun stops when a bite or scratch is too much. adult cats who didn't play this way are more likely to scratch or bite.. obviously this only works if you shout loudly (""oww!"") and stop playing if a bite or scratch is too hard.

i've only been scratched or bitten by cats that weren't properly socialized in this way. cats that have been socialized this way have always shown amazing skill at not scratching or biting. for example, i have a cat who goes nuts over a hair tie and i can hold it in my hand as the bats at it without fear because she perfectly and expertly keeps her claws in to avoid scratching my hand, even in the fervor of the chase. but once the hair tie is away from my hand, all claws are out.

similarly, there was i time i had to quickly grab my cat in a way that hurt her, and she had a natural reaction to crane around and bite my hand in her pain, but it was just a gentile mouth touch, even in her distress. this goes for vet visits, holding cats down to take medicine, cleaning wounds, etc. properly trained cats will have better restraint around bites or scratches, but cats that never learned restraint are more likely to.",9
"my 45m wife 42f revealed she was unfaithful and i'm divorcing her. our children 15f & 17m hate me for it.. edit: guys, i appreciate the advice. but i'm not asking on how to get past the infidelity. i've made my decision, and it's not something i'm willing to forgive. i'm looking for advice on how to handle this with my kids, and how to reassure them we can still be a family even if we aren't married.

my wife and i have been together for 18 years. we had our ups and downs but overall our marriage has been solid and she was my best friend. we've always been very close with our children and have raised them very much as a unit, and in turn they're very close to us.

about two weeks ago i brought up an advice column in the paper i had read regarding infidelity and talked about it for a bit, and i could see she had clearly started to tear up and was attempting to hide it, so i asked her what was bothering her. she confessed that about 7 years ago she cheated on me with a former coworker on a business trip, and then once with him after that before breaking it off due to guilt. this was around the time she left that job for a new one which she had told me back then was due to feeling like it wasn't a good fit but now confesses was because she didn't want to work with him anymore. she says she never had a good reason for it, she knew it was wrong then but gave into the urge and nothing has ever happened since. claims she confessed now as she can't live with the guilt of hiding it from me. we talked about for the next three days when the kids were in school while trying our best not to let them know while they were home. i realized i knew i'd never be able to let this go, nor would i be able to forgive her. she's distraught.

we sat our kids down to tell them about the fact our marriage was ending. obviously this was extremely tough. they acted as one could expect and blame was thrown at both of us. my wife and i agreed to tell them it was mutual, but i guess guilt got the better of her again because she ends up crying and telling them not to blame me, that she ""betrayed my trust"" in the past and just told me now, and that it's all her fault. this had the opposite effect that she intended, and now both our kids absolutely resent me for not ""forgiving mom"" and ruining our family. my wife has repeatedly tried to put blame back on herself, which only makes the kids double down and defend her more as if she's the victim. i don't want to drag their mother through the mud, so i'm being trying to explain as tactfully as i can, but they're gone as far as saying that when i get my own apartment they don't want to see me anymore and refuse my suggestion of seeing a therapist together and reject the idea that i still plan to see them on a regular basis and be on good terms with their mother. my wife isn't helping matters as she's been an emotional wreck since i've told her of my plan to leave.

i love my kids, but i don't know how to make them understand this without dragging their mother through the mud. i don't know how to assure them this has nothing to do with them or that i'm not trying to punish or hurt their mom. i just know that i cannot get past this, and for my own happiness i need to leave. any suggestions on how to get them to stop seeing me as the villain would be helpful.

"us, ok disgruntled neighbor has installed a strobe light to stop epileptic kids from using a school bus stop.. to give some context on where we live: we're in a small neighborhood of about 5 homes; it's a very small cul-de-sac area in the middle of farmland. there aren't other homes or buildings for about 2 miles.

i have 3, young, elementary aged children that all have a very serious case of epilepsy: it does not take much to cause an episode. by some luck, two of our neighbor's kids also have epilepsy, and are also around the same age as our kids. for the past few years they have been able to successfully group together and go to the end of our community to catch the bus.

the family who used to own the house at the street recently moved out, and there is a new owner who has been an absolute hell to everyone. from the second day on, he has harassed our kids telling them to get off his property, even though they were technically on a public road. through the grapevine he somehow learned that a majority of the kids were epileptic, and has installed strobe lights in his front lawn. these are very powerful, very fast lights that you can not avoid walking by.

we've contacted the police, and they won't even come out to talk to the guy. we've contacted the school to see if they could come into the neighborhood to pick up our kids, and they really can't: the bus just couldn't drive into our neighborhood and easily back out. they have to be picked up on the street.

"(update) school wants my son's facebook password & email, also wants us to hand over any phone or computer that he's had access to in the last year. wtf? florida. this is an update to this post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6pcmwx/school_wants_my_sons_facebook_password_email_also/).

i went to school and asked what's going on. i did that both to confirm that the call was genuine and to see why they want to violate my son and our family's privacy on such a massive scale.

first, the call was genuine and it wasn't a scam. second, the principal explained the situation to me. it had to do with another student who attempted suicide because of bullying during the summer. thank goodness she is now alright (and has since moved to another school) but this was part of the school's investigation to figure out how it happened.

when i asked how is it any of my son's business, they said they've seen them hang out together and while they don't think my son was involved in the bullying himself, they'd like to read his conversations with her because she may have confined in him about the students involved in bullying. i asked why this information wasn't obtained from the parents of that student, the answer was that they weren't willing to work with the school about it and she had left so they had no power (strange use of words in this situation) over them.

i told them to leave my son out of this witchhunt and the way they're speaking to us they sound like they're trying to bully us into helping their anti-bullying investigation which is troubling and absurd. i told them that if they ever approach my son or try to take his phone or anything by force or threat i'm going to make a big deal out of this, talk to the superintendent and hire a lawyer.

up until this day, they haven't said or done a thing.

i talked to my son about the girl and what happened to her, he knew her and they had some mutual friends but they weren't exactly friends and he wasn't aware of her suicide attempt. he only knew that she had left the school. he showed me their conversations and there wasn't much there except talking about movies and tv shows.

in short: they backed off after i made sure they understood that i won't take any harassment or violation of our privacy lightly.

small edit; thanks for the couple of who messaged me the mistake. someone messaged me and asked me if the parents of the girl had allowed the school to share the suicide news with me. i will try talking to them to make sure. they deserve to know if the school is not respecting their privacy, it's something they seem to be good at.

""ok."" 

""oh i hope so."" as she walked away. 

i burst out crying and hate myself for expressing emotion because she got what she wanted. she won. 

there was surprisingly no police at the gate, no one to handcuff me and read my miranda rights. i made it home in one piece. still worried about the police contacting me and being banned from future aa flights. i've been an emotional wreck and can't stop crying. my thanksgiving and holiday flights are both on aa.

i can't believe this is happening to me. i'm flying from chicago to boston now and police are waiting for me when i land, so i don't have much time but am still gonna try and figure out my options. 

edit: i've looked all over the internet and can't find any faa rule stating that your feet have to be on the ground during takeoff. 

here's what happened:

..

i was on an american airlines flight from chicago to boston on november 3rd, 2019. because of low blood pressure, a foot injury, and to prevent my ankles and feet from swelling, i use a small sling that hangs from the tray table (while closed) and props your feet higher. this sling is often advertised on facebook for this exact purpose - to make flights more comfortable for us shorter passengers. 

right before takeoff, the flight attendant, who was in a very grumpy mood, yelled at me to put my feet on the ground. i am a frequent traveler and have never been instructed to put my feet on the ground before. 

""you have to put your feet on the ground!"" i cannot emphasize how rudely she barked at me. 

""no i don't but okay."" as i put my feet down. emphasizing again. **i complied and put my feet down the first and only time she asked.** although i had never been instructed to put my feet down in the 100+ flights i've taken with my foot sling, i complied. i put my feet down immediately. 

even if it's technically not allowed by some rule i'm not aware of, the flight attendant unnecessarily escalated the situation. 

she immediately escalated: 
""would you like to go back to the gate? we're gonna go back to the gate!"" and immediately ran down the cabin to her crew members in the back. 

but right after she said that, the captain announced that we were taking off. 

she came back to my seat and barked: 
""police will be waiting for you when we land in boston.""

my seatmates were equally shocked at her escalating behavior. i had put my feet down when she asked, and my 5 words, ""no i don't but okay"" are now the cause of a police interrogation. 

her statement caused me to panic inside. i'm now mid-flight with no idea what will await me at the gate. 

so i took some time-stamped photos immediately and stowed my foot sling back into my backpack for the remainder of the flight. 

am i fucked?",2
"alcohol is overrated and drinking in general is not that fun.. i personaly think drinking kinda sucks it taste like watered down aloe to me i personally dont like the feeling you get after drinking a lot it's pretty shit aswell. i never saw the appeal in drinking but almost every other person goes on about how they're gonna be be drinking all night, sometimes talking about how drunk they'll get and talking about how great it is, am i missing something ?

and before someone says its about socializing, the people and having fun with your friends i doubt that since i have what could be described as a drunk as a older brother. hes probably part of the reason i dont see the appeal in it but ive never enjoyed having him and his friends around when they started drinking but absolutely loved them when they where sober and could hold a proper conversation.

im trying not to come off as someone saying im holier than thou, this is just something i couldn't understand why its as popular as it is.

(not part of my opinion just a bit of detail and a big old thank you to the awesome community!)

1) beforehand, i jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and i got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). she replies ""don't worry, if that were you and i, we'd make the most of it"" with a wink face after. i laughed it off and forgot about it. 

2) driving home, she tells me about her friends which 'know of every hidden fucking-spot' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. i replied, ""i guess that's an interesting thing to know"" with a laugh. she then looks to my backseat and goes ""yeah, there's not much you could do in my car though"". i then replied ""you know probably not"" and thought no more of it.

"update: my wife (30f) suffers from extreme germophobia and anxiety. i (30m) take as many as 30 showers a week to ease her fear of infection. our relationship is not sustainable and i need help.. edit:  here is the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/azwevy/my_wife_30f_suffers_from_extreme_germophobia_and/), for those that havent seen it

&#x200b;

its been awhile since my original post, but i didnt want to post until there was substantial progress.

since then, not much has improved. i decided to convince her to attend out patient behavioral therapy. to my surprise, she agreed and i was so happy.

unfortunately, she refused to attend the session last night and became violent and suicidal.  i had no choice but to get the police involved and have her committed to in patient therapy.

this was the hardest thing i have ever had to do.  i feel so broken right now.  i'm going to see a counselor in hopes that i can figure out what to do.

i dont know how long they are going to keep her in patient yet but i pray that she takes advantage of it because i still love her and i did this because i still do.

i told myself i would stop enabling her, mainly because i just cannot sustain this life. i am physically and mentally exhausted.  my kids are my top priority but i cant take care of them if i dont first take care of myself.

i thank all of you who reached out to me on the original post and and recommended things to try. she was set to attend group cognitive behavioral therapy today and i hope that it will help her.

thanks for reading.",8
"for using money we ""earmarked"" for our 6 month old's college fund to buy back the exact 1972 ford bronco i owned as a teenager?. so how to begin with this...i realize that on paper i am totally the asshole but when you dig deeper into my motivations i'm hoping its more of a grey area that anything else and maybe even i did the right thing. 

when i was a teenager my dad bought me a classic 1972 ford bronco. it was my true passion and i don't recall a memory from high school that somehow doesn't involve that truck. plus my dad and i would spend hours and hours working on it together and we went through that especially father/son rough patch when i was teenager it was always that bronco that brought us back together. i made a huge mistake and sold the truck when i turned 19 and my dad died of a heart attack two months later so while not logical, i've always felt a karmic connection between the two events. 

we had a baby in early february. she is our first and the light of my life. my wife is doing well but she's back at work and she's realized that she hates all the day cares we've tried and really wants to be a stay at home mom and plus she's still very hormonal from delivery, lack of sleep and breastfeeding so she's having a rough time and is angry a lot. i guess i need to say this. 

two weeks ago i was driving through our town's warehouse district and saw a bronco that was pretty beat up but resembled mine. i stopped just for nostalgias sake and the owner came out and let me take a look inside. my dad and i had glued a wheat penny under the dash as sort of security measure so i just sort of checked and goddamned if it wasn't my bronco! 

i asked him if he'd ever consider selling it, he said actually someone was on i-25 as we spoke from colorado to buy it for $21000. i freaked out and asked him if i could buy it right then and there for $23000. he said if i could come up with the cash, yes. i had been procrastinating setting up a 529 so i had $12000 in savings that my wife's parents had given us, i maxed out my credit card to venmo and my mom bought down a check for $4000 and i fucking drove away in my old car. it was like a dream come true. like a literal dream come true. it needs a lot of work i can't afford right now but it's mine. like in my driveway mine. again. i can't even describe what a joy this is. 

my wife and her parents are furious with me. they feel i was deceptive, that a ""real"" man would have sacrificed anything and everything so my wife could go stay at home with his kids and that's setting aside that they gave us the money for a college fund. my point is my daughter is only 6 months old, we have 18 years to set up a college fund of her. but this bronco means everything to me and if i wouldn't have acted it would have been gone forever. now it can be that same connection between me and my kids. to me it's the literal meaning of happiness.

like i said on paper--asshole...whole story--grey area. how do you guys see it?

edit: had no idea this would go so one way. i guess i messed up. i talked with my mom and she is basically going to buy the bronco from me in order to refill the college fund and pay off the credit card. the $4k will be a gift and she's going to give me whatever i need to restore it. she's always been awesome to me and she's rather the money be spent now than wait for me and my sisters inheritance. sorry to get everyone so mad at me, i was thinking with my emotions and acted badly

edit2: are the ""mommy bailed you out"" comments really necessary ? i found a solution and it's coming from me and my sisters inheritance so it's not like i'm not paying for it on my own eventually.

edit 3: my inbox is so buried i have no idea what those icons are that are where gold used to be. does anyone know what those are ?

edit4: i'm getting a 403 error whenever i try to respond, not sure what that means but i'm still reading because honestly i'm afraid to go home even with the great news i know my wife is going to be upset for one reason or another

edit5: does anyone know what 403 error means? i messaged the moderators but they must be busy /u/snausagefest since you're a mod, do you know? i can't respond to any posts and get the ""status 403"" whenever i try. thanks!

edit in the morning: i couldn't figure out why i was getting so many private's  but i guess this must be locked now. i didn't tell my wife that my mom bailed me out and lied and said i found a buyer for the bronco. i'll figure out how to cross that bridge when i get there but my wife was so relieved that i ""had come to your senses"" i don't want to disappoint her. it's going to take all my lying skills to pull this one off over the next few years.",3
"by stumbling on my 19 y/o sons reddit and reading through it.. dear lord. on my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so i clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  i click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...

this is my sons account. it has to be. the comment he posted is about something that happened while i was there. he had a more detailed post about that specific day. he had another previous post about an event in his life i knew about and knew some details about. he had a few other posts which i also read. 

i now know what gets him going sexually. not something i needed to know.

i know what his girlfriend likes sexually. also, not something i needed to know. also quite surprising. 

i know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. i feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.

i know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife's room.

in reading through the comments he's made to others, i've learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. i feel very proud about that.

overall, i wish i never clicked that first comment. i know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.

tl;dr. accidentally discovered my son on reddit. found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.

**edited to add: yes, i shouldn't have read all of it. and some posts i stayed away from. and honestly, i didn't realize it right-right away. the first post i read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. it was after another that i really put the pieces together. and yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. but hey, life isn't always fair. i also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything i read.**",4

"just became homeless and have $130 and a bike, what do i do?. so a few hours ago i was kicked out of my parents house. i've been ""disowned"" or something. they made it really clear they wont be taking me back. im 20, no job, no real friends and no family at all.

i was able to get my bike from my parents' since i did buy it with my own money and took my life savings which so happen to only be $130. maybe it hasnt hit me yet cause its only been a few hours but its starting to get really late and i have nowhere to go or sleep. i was considering a hotel but that would take a huge chunk out of my money so im considering just doing an all nighter in a 24h mcdonalds. im guessing i'll have to buy something every few hours so i won't get kicked out. 

so basically what the fuck do i do next? im considering maybe odd jobs but i have no idea how to find them. so if there's an app or a website for that i'll take recommendations.




edit: im saved!! well not yet, but i was able to contact an old high school friend of mine. he works night shifts and he said he can pick me up after so it won't be until 5 or 6 am. right now my plan is just to stay at the mcdonalds until then. im really thankful for everyone who commented and tried helping. this post was kind of dramatic but im glad i wont have to sleep in the streets

edit2: wow this blew up fast. i see a lot of people doubting that my parents just kicked me out overnight. i never really got along with them, i worked at a car-wash for a while until a few weeks ago and thats when the arguments started happening. i wasnt paying for rent anymore and i did get a little bit depressed and didnt really care about anything. im not saying it isnt my fault what happened, it absolutely is, this was a wake up call. i'm extremely grateful to my friend, he is allowing me to stay up to 2 months to get my shit together. as long as i pay for the internet and my own food.

a lot of people think that the fact my life savings is only  $130 is because im a drug addict, that isnt it. i worked a minimum wage job while parents asked me for rent and internet (i dont blame them).

a lot of people were recommending joining the military. i've considered the navy when i was younger and i might as well do it now, better than never so im going to meet up with a recruiter tomorrow (already talked on the phone)


((edit3)) a lot of people have asked if i have a paypal or venmo. im very glad that there are many nice people here on reddit, but i would much rather you keep your money or use it for someone who needs it more than me. my situation isnt that bad. and again, thanks to everyone for all the advice",7

"my mom's defibrillator malfunctioned and shocked her 40+ times at 600v. the doctor's all denied responsibility for the cause. it put my parents hundreds of thousands of dollars into medical debt.. location: us. original incident happened in indiana.

i should first and foremost say that this happened about 10 years ago, so at this point i doubt it's possible to do anything about the situation.

&#x200b;

when i was 16, my mom was driving me to a friend's house when her defibrillator starting shocking her repeatedly every few seconds. she thought it was just doing its job, until the shocking continued where it surpassed 40 shocks at 600 volts. this led to severe heart damage  and required multiple open-heart surgeries to fix. it turned out that the wires that connected to her box malfunctioned and were sending signals that her heartbeat was off.

&#x200b;

it could be some form of ptsd i suffered from seeing my mom nearly die in my arms, but her defibrillator almost triggered again today and it brought back those memories. she told me that her and my dad tried to pinpoint who was responsible (the company who made the wires, the defibrillator company, etc.) but all of the doctors she saw denied responsibility.

"for allowing two teenagers to be spit on by a llama?. i work at a petting zoo here, and this weekend we had two teenager (around 16, boyfriend and girlfriend) who were antagonizing a llama.

i told them ""you might want to cut that out! llamas spit in self-defense."" but they kind of laughed my warning off.

now, i knew that llama spit was a whole lot worse than they probably thought it was. but i decided not to tell them about that. i figured if they persisted, i'd trust the llama to teach them a lesson.

the llama was being patient. at one point it gave them a ""warning spit"" (just saliva) and they went ""eww"" and laughed about it and brushed it off, and then kept going at it.

finally, the llama had enough...and unleashed its green, defensive spit that llamas are known for. it got the girl square in the face. she dropped to her knees and started retching, and eventually threw up. her boyfriend was gagging and ran away, towards the building that i was in.

to make things worse for them, i didn't even let them come in to wash up in the petting zoo's only bathroom! it was a slow day, so i just locked the doors. i told them i didn't want that smell inside, and made them leave the farm without washing up.

aita? the girl's parents called me the next day and yelled at me saying that was too harsh. maybe it was...i knew that if you don't wash out llama spit right away the smell sinks into your skin and becomes extremely hard to remove, but i wanted the lesson to sink in as well.",3

obviously i think he's gorgeous and handsome but even though i've been saying this for years, he does not believe me. so, for some stupid reason, i decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. i set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. 

after a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after i showed this to him, i saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. 

queue my surprise when a couple of days later i check the tinder account i had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and i could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. 

i confronted him and he denied it but i mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity i checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. so now the tinder i made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool

tl;dr: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with

"was i sexually assaulted? if so, what should i do?. for the past couple of months, i've been working in a restaurant. there's this girl there who keeps flirting with me and harrasing me, touching my arms, openly announcing she's looking through my social media profiles, won't stop snapping me or facebooking me, i've since deleted her snapchat and blocked her on facebook. 

anyway, yesterday during lunch hour, she kept feeling my arms. i moved my arm away to which she responded ""don't you like to be touched?"" to which i responded ""not by you"". so she went to kick me in the balls but i moved out of the way and said ""no chance"". 

as we all went to leave work later that day, there was a slight hold up at the door so we were all just jammed up and stood in a line, she was in front of me. she moved her ass against my crotch and touched it with her hands to which i pushed her away from me and warned her not to do it again. she said ""i'm only joking"" before trying to do it again in fucking plain sight of the others. i told her to fuck off and leave me alone and then she laughed and accused me of being gay. all the girls laughed, while all the guys looked disgusted. the manager wasn't present during this.

anyway, we all left and me and a friend were walking and he turned to me and said ""dude, isn't that basically sexual assault?"" i responded ""is it?"" he said ""man, she literally molested you and tried again"" 

honestly, i don't know what to think. i am contemplating telling the manager but i feel she'll laugh it off and class it as a joke because i'm a man. and no offence to us guys, but harrassment and sexual assualt isn't taken as seriously if a man is getting harrassed. just think of it, if i had done that, i'd be fired on the spot and have the cops on my case.

"for not giving my empty row of plane seats to a mother with toddlers?. this happened a couple weeks ago, but i'm still conflicted about it, so here goes. 

i travel a lot for work, mostly one route between the east and west coasts. most recently, i was out on the west coast and had to push my flight back by a few hours, and ended up switching to a red eye that would get me home at around 5:30am. this wouldn't be a problem except that i had a client meeting at 8:30 that morning, so while switching my ticket i paid out of pocket to upgrade to a window seat in an exit row, because the whole row was empty and that way i had a decent shot of getting at least a little bit of sleep. (because i take this specific route and airline a lot, i knew a few things about this particular row - namely that you can't recline the seats more than an inch or two and the window is usually kind of weird, which was fine by me since i just wanted to get on the plane and conk out.)

of course, when it came time to board, i get to my row and find that a woman is sitting in the middle with her two young daughters, maybe 2 and 4, on either side of her. i politely told her that she'd made a mistake and was sitting in my seat. her response was that she was seated a row up and across the aisle, on the aisle seat, but her two kids were across from her on the aisle and middle, and she saw the empty row before i got there, and would i do her the favor of just switching?

here's the thing: if circumstances were different, i would have! but i explained that i had a meeting at 8:30 and paid extra for that ticket so that i could sleep. i really thought that would be the end of it, but she huffed and shook her head and buckled her kids' seatbelts right then and there. 

by this point the plane is filling up, i'm blocking the aisle, it's causing a whole thing, so i just flag down a flight attendant and explain the situation. the mom stops ignoring me long enough to pipe up and say she needs a row where the three of them can sit together. the flight attendant (who looked exhausted and totally done and clearly just wanted to get home as much as i did) goes, ""this is an exit row. your kids can't sit there because they're not capable of performing the exit row responsibilities in case of an emergency landing. there's not going to *be* another empty row. please sit in the seat indicated on your ticket.""

so i sit down in my window seat and she takes her kids and moves up a row, and i figure that's the last of it, but of course, no one else comes to sit down in my row (the gamble paid off), and so when we finally take off and hit cruising altitude, i push the arm rests up and stretch out across the row and just pass out. when we land, i'm getting my bag out of the overhead, and the woman stands up and mutters to me, ""you look like you slept well, bitch.""

so, reddit. am i the asshole (or bitch, as it were)?

**edited to add:** okay, thanks reddit, i think most of you agree that i'm not the asshole here. but please do me a favor and don't refer to her kids as brats or assume they were ill-behaved. the kids were just fine. they watched something on their ipad and went to sleep as soon as we took off. kids don't like flying more than anyone else, and it's not these girls' fault their mom acted like a jerk.",3

"if i started calling my white coworkers by random 'white' names?. i moved from georgia to the pacific northwest last year for a dream job after i graduated college. it was a little bit of a culture shock, because i went from being one of many black people around at any given time to often being the only non-white person in a room, let alone black person. there hasn't been a lot of overt racism, but there's been a lot of strange borderline situations that are amusing and race-related but not necessarily racist. for example, every white woman i meet mentions beyonce to me within the first five minutes. when i was sitting for my driver's license photo the woman taking my picture opened with, 'so... beyonce.'

so the problem in the post title is that i am the only black woman at my office, and i am constantly, constantly being called the wrong name at work, and i'm coming up on my one-year anniversary. my name is tina, short for christina. pronounced just like it looks, very easy name. for some reason, a handful of people at work call me tiana, tiara, or tia, i think assuming that my name has to be more 'black sounding' than it is. i am most often called tiana, especially by one of the guys on our development team and by the 'big boss' for another team, which i think then confuses their team members back into calling me the wrong name again. the other thing is that apparently another black woman (elderly, not in the same position i'm in) used to work there and i get called her name (mary) sometimes too. sometimes people will look at my name plate and ask me, ""how do you pronounce that?"" it's tina!

i have tried politely correcting this and i correct it immediately every time. from polite, ""just for the record, my name is tina!"" to lighthearted, ""tina, like tina belcher!"" in e-mails from me that say tina in a million places, including my e-mail address, i still get, ""thanks tiana!"" sooo... i'm considering doing the twitter approach, where i just respond to coworkers who call me the wrong name with the wrong name. like:

chuck: thanks, tiana

tina: no problem, chad!

jessica: hi tiara!

tina: good morning, jennifer!

would i be the asshole if i did this? i know it's passive aggressive, but every form of polite correction hasn't worked, and i feel really disrespected by this, so i may as well have some fun with it.

edit: i am pretty overwhelmed by the responses so i just want to add a couple of things:

a lot of people have suggested that i gently and firmly remind people of my name. that's what i've been doing, and was my first line of defense!

a lot of people have suggested i go to hr. this is the kind of nebulous thing hr doesn't really help with, and it isn't as serious as it could be.

a lot of people who identify themselves as white have informed me that this isn't race-related. it is. i have been black for 25 years, and i have a lot of firsthand experience with racism, and i can identify it in my own life. it isn't overt racism, like a slur or an assault, but it is still race-related. i feel like a few people are almost getting it. a lot of people are referencing that key and peele sketch with the substitute teacher, which is literally a joke about how white people do this to black people, turned on its head!

and finally, a few people have asked why i don't use tina turner as an example, since she's also a black tina. first, i thought young-ish white people would be more familiar with tina belcher, but i used 'tina turner' as an example for our dean and he then 'affectionately' nicknamed me tina turner, which took deprogramming from his ea to get over.

edit #2:

no, i don't have a southern accent. i'm from atlanta, and black people from atlanta don't really have an indecipherable country twang. plus, my 'working in an office' voice is pretty practiced/neutral. more to the point, no accent makes the name 'tina' sound like 'tiana' or ""tiara""

no, the people i work with aren't just 'idiots.' as annoying as this is, they are not stupid people.

no, i can't wear a 'hi, my name is' sticker or a nametag. we have a business professional dress code!

yes, i correct them every time.

no, it's not because i'm not 'memorable' or a bad employee!

responding to this post saying, 'okay shaniqua' or some other racist caricature of a name truly misses the point, as this is already what my coworkers are doing ('tiana' being the 'shaniqua' in this instance). several people have alarmingly said, 'okay, trayvon' and invoking the name of a dead black child at the idea of me calling a white guy 'chad' is very weird!",3

"men who leave after learning their kids aren't theirs aren't doing anything wrong. i was reading a post saying that if a man is with a woman raising a family and she tells him the kids aren't his, that he would be in the wrong to leave because ""the kid is innocent"" and that he is still obligated to be a parent to that kid because the woman trapped him by lying to him.

so as long as a woman is able to keep up a lie for several years, she should be able to trap any man to be a dad to her kids?

"the death of a young adult is generally sadder than the death of a child.. generally speaking, everyone seems to think that a life that ends at its very beginning is the saddest thing ever. frankly, i believe that dying of sickness or an accident when you're a young adult (20-35 years old more or less) is way out more brutal.

the child leaves almost nothing behind. it's terrible for the family, that's for sure, but at the same time that person hasn't brought anything to the world yet and most of children don't even know what's happening while they're dying.   on the other hand a young adult leaves friends, sometimes a companion or children. they had something to live for, absolute lucidity on the matter and a half fulfilled life that they will never be able to put a good ending to.

i don't mean to say that children deserve more to die than young adults, that's obvious, but generally speaking i think that the death of a person who already lived half a life and leaves it all behind  is way out sadder than just a kid that has no or very little conscience of what's happening and most of the time does not have something to live for other than the only fact of living.

- i'm not saying the death of a child is worthless. to those who told me i should kill myself because i'm advocating the death of children (?), just know that you can't even fucking read
- of course  it depends on the situation, that's why a put ""generally"".
- it's not a competition but it doesn't mean things can't be discussed 
- english is not my first language, so if you think my grammar is shit i'm sorry but couldn't care less.

"there needs to be a small dick acceptance movement before i even begin to give a shit about fat acceptance for women.. perhaps this isnt an unpopular opinion, but i'm a bi man who hasn't ever gotten with another man but i talk to gay men a lot. (i've never engaged with it for my own personal reasons but that's besides the point)

i don't think many women realize how fucking horrible it is for a man to have a small dick. how emasculating it is to be judged solely on something that you have absolutely no control over. my size isn't great either but i've come to accept it, however, i know many men who simply can't and most women and society at large do **nothing** to support a person with a small dick. 

when i see all the normal shit about fat acceptance or otherwise loving women no matter what size they are, i laugh because they can fucking *change* their size. a man can't. a woman can get larger breasts, a man can't increase his size. why should i focus my energy on making those who can change their situation or otherwise in the case of fat people **put themselves in the situation to begin with** feel more comfortable about themselves while those who can't do **anything** to help their situation aren't even fucking mentioned in the mainstream until it's convenient.

the rise in hookup culture is only doing more harm. many men can't stack up, what's considered ""average"" size is in many cases thought of as small. while it's taboo to shame a woman for their body, small dick jokes seem as if they are completely fair game and the hypocrisy is absolutely disgusting to me.

edit: as an addendum, i'd like to also take the time to bitch about men with bigger dicks. 

all i can say is fuck most of you. you treat your smaller brothers like shit most of the time. thinking you're fucking special or you did something to earn your sexual prowess, fuck off. it was luck of the god damn draw you should be getting on your knees and thanking whatever cosmic force responsible for bestowing your prowess unto you. while the rest of the population has to carefully disclose their size to every partner, wondering in the back of their mind if they *truly* don't care. even though i accept my size (it's about 5 and a half inches) i know i could have it a lot worse and many men do. i still have it in the back of my mind that whoever i'm with isn't actually satisfied with my size like they say they are. i'm glad you fucks don't ever have to deal with that because i wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy to be honest. 

**edit 2: i would like to address some comments and common replies and also give a brief overview of my thoughts thus far.**

i didn't think this was going to blow up like it did. i'm glad it did to be honest because it really put some things in perspective for me. 

firstly i'd like to address this ludicrous notion that i hate women. i dont know how i can prove to any of you that i dont hate women other than me saying i dont. i may have used harsh words but my words were not to disparage any one group just for existing. my problem was purely with the double standards, with the non-inclusion of men in the mainstream body positive movement. 

i understand and agree that fat acceptance is something we should be concerned about. no one *should* be made to feel horrible about themselves based on their body by other people. my main point was i believe we should be striving for an all inclusive body positive movement that encompasses everyone from burn victims to people with major deformaties, to men and women whom have insecurities. **i never said one couldn't have a fat positive movement.** (despite my disagreements with it due to the unhealthy side effects encouraging obesity can lead to but that's besides the point) i simply *longed for an all inclusive body positive movement* to be pushed just as much if not more than the fat acceptance movement. i get that caring about one thing within a movement doesnt necessarily negate your concern for other issues. but from where i'm sitting it doesnt seem like a lot of men get the same amount of support for their body issues by comparison of women. perhaps that's just my confirmation bias, and if that's the case i apologize and acknowledge my fault. and before anyone addresses it, i'm not even necessarily advocating for a small dick movement despite the title. that was mostly just for flair and to discuss the notion of body positive movements not including men, and i used penis size as an example. what i really want is inclusivity. of everyone. 

another topic i'd like to address is the idea that ""women can't hide the fact that they're fat, men dont broadcast their dick size so it's not as much of a daily struggle by comparison of fat people."" while i understand the logic, i dont really see how its productive. sexual relationships is a *huge* part of humanity as a whole. many of us crave it, strive for it. make it the focus of our daily lives in some cases whether we want to or not. when a person feels inadequate about themselves this can have **major** implications on a persons psyche. if left untreated it can have damaging effects on ones personality and mental state which ultimately harms them on the day to day. i understand that's not a healthy way to go about it, they should be seeking help themselves. but i feel many men are discouraged from talking about it, it's made out to be as if it doesn't matter. which is why i'm encouraging an all inclusive body positive movement. but i feel the main point those who say this are trying to make is that there's more pressure put on society to accept ones outward appearance that is visible to the naked eye. and i agree with that, but all i'm really saying is we should be reaching higher. 

i obviously can't be the judge of my own character, but i believe i'm a bit of an idealist. for better or worse, i sincerely believe humanity coming together as a whole is not only possible, but necessary for humanity to advance in any meaningful way. whether it was your intent or not, having a body positive movement that is pushed in the mainstream that is only really geared towards supporting one group can lead to feelings of neglect for another. 

another topic that was brought up was about my abrasiveness. many thought i was an asshole in my post and i would agree with that. i admit i'm a bit of a douchebag but that's why i dont want to be the one ""leading the charge"" so to speak. many suggested that i should start the movement myself, but i'm simply not the right person for the job. i'm hot headed, i sometimes don't think before i speak and many people tend to vehemently disagree with my opinions. i'm a private person, despite how i am online with anonymity, in real life i am a bit of a hermit and have horrible anxiety when placed in uncomfortable positions. i also dont feel it would even be taken seriously given the replies. i see posts of people posting this post on other subs to bitch about it. ""r/unpopularopinion where white men go to whine about shit no one cares about."" i knew there would be opposition to this post and i was prepared for it, but some of the replies honestly make me feel like shit. perhaps rightly so, because i'm a bit of a dick. but love me or hate me, i stand by most of what i said. 

i sincerely hope that if you take away anything from this, it's that we shouldnt be focusing on advancing one particular group. supporting one particular group. (culturally speaking i'm not talking about specific diseases or aggretious physical phenomena) i care about people despite what many of you may believe. and all i really want is peace and acceptance of everybody. (aside from douchebags who think they're better than everyone else i.e in regards to the first edit about people who flaunt their bigger dicks)

the last major point i'd like to address is many people believe me to be insecure. somehow me being insecure invalidates the very real lack of support for males in this department. i'll admit that sure, i wish i had a bigger dick. i feel a bit shitty about it at times but for the most part i can tolerate it. i've had partners who didn't care and i genuinely believe them. i know they're out there it's just a matter of finding them. so you can call me an insecure whiny little bitch all you want but you're only proving my point.  

one last thing is i really do appreciate the discussion. there are a lot of points i strongly disagree with that i didn't address here, and there are many ideas i really should think over and reevaluate myself. and i thank  everyone for giving me the opportunity.",6

and because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a unesco heritage site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against ddt.

"by not going to the hospital when i knew something was wrong with me. as usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. i'd like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident i was 29 years old. first, a little back story...

sunday, april 2, 2017 started like any other sunday for me. i woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend's oil changed, as well as my own. i drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. i drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. i was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.

as i watched the video i felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. having never had a migraine before, i assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. the pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though i was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. they finished the oil and as they did, i texted my girlfriend to let her know that i had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.

i got back to her house, popped a couple ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. i woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. i decided i would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning i would be good to go to work.

i woke up monday morning still feeling like shit and decided i was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. my girlfriend tried her best to convince me that i needed to go to the er but i told her i just needed more rest and would be fine. she reluctantly let me try to rest as much as i could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. the only relief i could find was taking pain killers, which i'm not a big fan of, and napping.

i woke up tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, ""enough is enough."" against my protest, she dragged me to the er...and saved my life.

i went in to the er and told them my symptoms, also telling them that i have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. they sent me to do a ct scan of my head, without the contrast because i wouldn't let them tap an iv on my arm. the ct scan was performed and i was brought back to the room to await the results. as i sat there i caught the dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. ""it was at this point i knew....something was fucked up!"" (dave chappelle voice)

the dr. came flying into the room and said, ""hey listen man, you've had a stroke and you've got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. i need to tap an iv on you right now, do another ct scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to stanford asap!""

my life stopped. ""a stroke? i'm 29? how could i have had a stroke?"" i couldn't comprehend what was happening but i looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. i got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (side note: i live in california but grew up in new jersey which is where all my family still resides) i quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. i asked her to please call my dad and hung up.

what happened next is a whirlwind. they tapped an iv, did a ct scan then i was transported by ambulance to stanford icu. i was greeted by the entire neurology department, both residents and students alike. the first woman i met said she, ""couldn't believe i was even still awake, let alone walking and talking."" she told me, ""usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.""

as i laid in icu they tapped an a-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more iv's (for a total of 4) into my other arm. they had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and i wouldn't be capable of making decisions for myself. they were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.

my parents flew in from jersey by the next day and i was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (wednesday). if you've never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. i've had 3. they lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are not asleep. they then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. let me repeat, you are awake for this!

the first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. the blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn't see anything. i was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and i was allowed to leave the hospital by friday morning. i used up all my fmla leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.

but wait...there's more!!!

6 weeks later i had to go back to stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. this time they found the culprit. i had what is known as an arterioveneous fistula burst inside my brain. it's when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. to my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which i did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).

6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke i went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. i was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the best neurosurgeons in the world. a 3rd angiogram was performed while i was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.

i awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain i have ever been in. while i was asleep, two more iv's had been put into my arm, an a-line had been put in my wrist again, and i had a c-line, which is an iv in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. the fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. they could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.

the surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me i would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. the next day after the surgery i realized that i had double vision so bad that i couldn't see with both my eyes open. it was either one or the other. i had to patch my eye until i could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. my surgery was on a wednesday and by friday i was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.

fast forward, to october 2, 2017.

my vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, i was finally ready to return to work. i was so excited my first day back, even though i wasn't in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. around 11:30 am i took my lunch and finished reading my book i had been reading. at 12:30 pm i returned to work and about 10 minutes later i decided i had to use the bathroom. i left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. as i walked back, i looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.

i could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what i describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. i got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. i started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. i think i tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in april) for help but i don't remember because i blacked out. next thing i remember was a foreman standing over me asking if i was alright and all i could think was, ""how'd this guy get in my bedroom?""

i was delirious, i had smashed my face on the concrete when i fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. my supervisor took me to the er where they did ct scans, blood work, ekg and chest x-rays. my white cell count was through the roof but they couldn't find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).

i did a follow up with my pcp (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to stanford neurology to talk with them. and so i have...and this is where i am today...

i was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. the issue, as i've been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. due to the amount of time i allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. had i gone to the er right when it happened, things may be different today.

what this means for me now is i'll likely lose my class a license and my career of doing physical work is over. thank god the company i work for is so large that they can move me to another position where i won't be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment i feel. working construction has been my all time favorite. i'm a blue collar guy and i get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. i've poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. my days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is done. it sucks. i'm not happy about it, but i don't let it change my outlook on life.

i refuse to give up on life. i can get through anything and i will get through this. i'm out of work until january 8, 2018 at which point i will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as i did before.

i tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. please, i'm begging you! if you ever feel like something is wrong with you...do not hesitate! go to the hospital! don't be like me, mr. toughguy, thinking you can get through it. you know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren't right.

i thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. may god bless your life and your health

update post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cc3mlx/update_my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly/)

so firstly thanks for all of your input. i read and considered every single reply. first i'll update you, then i'll tie up some loose ends from the comments in the previous post. i want to apologize for the bluntness of this post ahead of time, because despite your comments about me being calm and level headed, i'm actually quite upset about the entire situation, and i feel like me sitting and thinking about it is only marinading this anger and making it more juicy and flavorful. 

update: 

i spoke to her in person after i posted my update. from her perspective, her original idea was to make it look like she just got mad or something, grabbed a few things, and left to her friend's house, where she was going to have the party thrown. her friend has a really nice house that's perfect for a 20-30 person get-together. she was with her two friends, and made an off the cuff remark when her friend said, ""what are you going to say when he asks why?"" and she said, ""i don't know, i'll probably tell him that i feel like he got too serious when we had sex,"" or something like that. then her other friend who was with her immediately took it to social media with out the other two girls knowing, and then when they checked their phones later on that day, it was already a dumpster fire. 

i said great, all that is understandable. just one question - why did you then block me and then refuse to answer my calls, because that seemed pretty fucking intentional to me. 

she said because she didn't want to throw her idiot friend under the bus, and thought it would all go away if she just threw the party, and she hadn't realized how far it all went so quickly. 

i thanked her for telling me, and then i called off the wedding entirely. 

she cried, i cried, it was a goddamn mess. she asked where we go from here. i told her i don't know. i don't even know if the relationship is over yet, but i know that the engagement is over, and that **if** i decide to give it another chance, at the bare minimum, we need to build my trust for her from the ground up, if not the entire relationship. and now i have to decide if **i** want that. do i went to spend another 4 years being undecided? if i'm being honest with myself, i imagine it taking another couple of years before i can trust her again. do i want to get married and start *thinking* about having children at 35? 36? close to 40? 

i told her that i have a lot to think about. 

i spoke to her dad last night. we shared a case of beers and had a conversation that lasted about 5 hours. my ex (?) hasn't spoken to anyone, and has basically been locked up in her old bedroom for now. she's been crying a lot. i do believe that she's genuinely remorseful about all of this, which complicates things. 

her dad caught wind of the situation on facebook but learned what was really going on maybe like an hour later. he'd gotten my calls, but hadn't returned them because he called his daughter first. she told him, and he just didn't know what to say to her. he told me that she's not truly stupid, but that she has a history of sometimes not thinking about things before she says them, and the impact her off-hand remarks can have. he said this is the worst it's ever snowballed, but she's had situations in the past where she says something stupid or insulting, and doesn't realize the impact of what she said until hours later when the other person blows up over it. 

so that's it. i still have a lot to think about. i know a lot of you guys are telling me that i have no balls for not literally tossing her out into traffic and laughing about it or something weird like that, but you have to understand that i still love her and have loved her for a few years now. right now, i'm leaning toward moving on, but you're going to have to empathize with me here. 

as for my reputation, nobody thinks i'm an abuser. it's firmly out there now. her reputation took a much more significant and lasting hit. i haven't lost any friends, except for the idiot social media girl (whose reputation also took a severe hit), nobody called the cops, all the other posts about it have been deleted...everything is good. there's no real need for me to get a lawyer and sue anybody. 

my family agrees with a lot of you. they're 2 seconds away from slapping me upside me head for not immediately kicking her to the curb. just give me some time. i'm not going to make another update post, because i've already wasted too much of your time with this bullshit, but maybe i'll just update this post in a few days after i've decided what to do.",8

"for being honest with my nephew about where i was for most of his life?. okay, let me just get right into this. i 27m was kicked out at 16 because my older sister 37f outed me to my parents as gay. they completely cut off all contact with me and i didn't see any of my family up until last year, when my father passed away and mum had a change of heart and we started building a relationship again. when i was kicked out, my nephew was 5 years old. for the less maths savvy, that makes him 16 now. 

a couple of weeks ago, there was a family party in which he and i ended up spending most of the evening together, just chatting and stuff. he asked me why i wasn't around for so long and what happened between me and the fam to make them push me out like that. i asked him what his mum had told him and he just shrugged and said she won't talk about it. i told him he's maybe better having this conversation with her but he kept pressing until i eventually confessed i was cut off for being gay. he made a face and asked how my parents even found out. i told him i was outed by my sister, but that he must understand that this was a long time ago and that i don't think she'd do something like that *now* and that it was just a silly mistake on her part. he got a bit quiet and changed the subject. 

i got a phone call from my sister the next day furious that i'd told him and accusing me of trying to poison her not only against her but agaisnt the rest of the family too by ""pretending they're bad people"" and ""making up false homophobia accusations"". i explained to her that i didn't tell him anything but the truth because he asked and i think he's old enough to deserve honesty. she just kept yelling at me for dragging up the past and being a bad influence and has effectively banned me from hanging out with my nephew. i'm crushed because obviously i love the kid. did i do the wrong thing? should i have lied or refused to talk about it or lied to him or something?",3

"my son managed to read our will and it's destroying our family. i'm going to preface this by saying i love all three of my sons equally. they are 29, 24 and 22. it is my unequivocal truth.

it's just that that my ex wife's involvement with my oldest son has really introduced a lot of toxicity and complications in our life.

after years of emotional and financial abuse, my wife and i have made a very conscious decision to completely cut my ex-wife out of our lives once my son turned 18. we let him have his relationship with his mother without any interference from us or any negative words.

i disagree with a lot of how their relationship is but i have kept my mouth shut to keep the peace.

after losing literally everything after my divorce, i have built a new business with my wife and it's doing very well. all three of our sons work in the business.

a week ago, all the kids were over for lunch. i was stupid and left our recently drafted will on my office desk. my oldest son managed to see it.

our company and our home was willed to my two younger sons. my oldest was given a trust that pays out some money every five years. 

i feel like i have to explain myself over why the will was laid out as it was. my ex-wife still has a lot of influence over my son and at the suggestion of our lawyer, we created the will this way so she couldn't interfere in the company and home.

if she were to pass away before us, the will would be immediately rewritten to divide the company/home equally.

the plan was to explain this to our son gently and not for him to see it without any context.

my son was understandably upset but his behavior that day exceeded all levels of decency. he stormed downstairs, threw things around and used disgusting language against my wife and i. our sons nearly got into a fist fight.

i am devastated. i have already apologized and forwarded him emails to my lawyer telling him i want the will to be changed to split everything equally. but the damage is done.

he's now spreading horrible lies about us and his brothers to everyone in my family, even to the point of accusing us of being racists (he is half indian, half white). his brothers and my wife and i are so hurt hearing this. it couldn't be any further than the truth. it's the same thing my ex wife liked to accuse us of over the years.

he has refused to come in to work since the past week and i've been scrambling to do a lot of his work.

i don't know how to fix this. he won't take my calls.

my ex wife has used this situation to make absolutely insane posts on facebook that i am considering legal action over. but i know that will just add gasoline to the fire with regards to my son.

i'm not sure how to salvage this. and i am really afraid that some of the things he has said won't easily be forgotten. my younger sons have already been questioned on social media by their cousins about the racism accusations. it's a very uncomfortable thing to approach. my wife is also not over the names she was called by him, even though she says she is.

tl;dr my oldest son saw our will and is understandably upset. but now he is accusing us of racism and refusing to hear my side even after i have tried to fix it.",8
"by watching my neighbours fight while i was eating popcorn.. so i'm a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally i was watching the match on my living room little did i know there was another match going on my neighbours house. about ten minutes into my game, i started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.

between the game and the distance between us i really couldn't distinguish any words, so i just raised the volume of my tv and kept watching. during half time i got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don't watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so i lower the volume of the tv as i microwave some popcorn.

by this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as i take the popcorns out of the microwave i hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so i went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case i had to call the cops of something. now i have two dogs so i didn't wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so i brought it with me.

so here i am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. for the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. by now i could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so i thought. suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as i gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.

now try to see this from their perspective. they've been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. this got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.

""enjoying the show you \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!?""

i honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. they both flip the finger at me as walked inside ""can you believe this fucking guy!?"" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.

when i got inside i was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.

edit: i know some redditors don't really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments i've gotten.  you all made my night incredibly fun it's been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! also shut out to all the cruz azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game i was watching!

edit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn't a and it probably isn't a dramatic one i'd say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn't a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.

tl;dr my neighbours were having a big fight while i was watching a soccer game, i went out to check while she slapped her husband as i was holding a big bag of popcorn. my nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they're back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again.",4
"ketchup is fucking disgusting. a proper hamburger or cheeseburger should never have ketchup. it dominates the flavor and all you taste is shit. if i want to get the tomato profile, i will put a fucking tomato on my burger and not some pasty, corn syrup, sugary sissy bullshit. every burger place puts ketchup on the burger by default, so i have to always ask for no ketchup and have the chance of them fucking it up. you ketchup fuckers should have to ask for ketchup, not me.

putting ketchup on steak should be a capital offense and you should be sent to a reeducation camp. 

it's fat dumb people sauce. its the keystone or natty light of sauce. its putrid odor is reminiscent of filthy hooker perspiration. you can literally judge a person by how much ketchup they consume. ketchup kills more people in america then terrorism and drugs, yet we don't have a war on tomatoes. the world would be better without ketchup.",6
"neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. update: i'll be sure to post updates so please stop pming me or replying to my comments/post history outside of this sub asking me to do so or suggesting i shit-bomb them back. 

my wife noted that what we think might be his kid comes around most weekends. in the interest of remaining neighborly and with the possibility neighbor dude might be losing his mind, we're going to talk with them before lawyering up or involving the fuzz. updates forthcoming.

original post:
hey all, i have a shitty situation here that i'm hoping to get some advice about. this is in idaho.

&#x200b;

my neighbor is shit-bombing my front yard. a new neighbor bought a house across the street about 6 months ago. a few weeks back, i was working in the garage when i saw him take his dog directly across the street, into my front yard. he let it pee in my yard and then walked straight home. he didn't notice me  - my garage is set up as a shop and is pretty busy, and the garage door is up a lot - but this piqued my interest because it's goddamned weird. now, my wife and i have a dog so there are a few dog droppings from her that we pick up on a regular basis. my wife had been doing the dooty duty recently, so i asked her if there are more piles than normal. sure enough, she said there had been a ton for a while now. she figured it was assholes walking their dogs and letting them crap in our lawn. i figured it was our new weirdo neighbor.

&#x200b;

it happened again around a week later: i was in the garage as the neighbor took his dog into our lawn. this time the dog dropped a deuce and he started to walk away without picking it up. i called out to him, asking him if he needs a plastic bag to pick up after his dog, and he avoided eye contact and scurried back home.  i went across the street and knocked on his door. he didn't answer. we set up a security camera to discretely watch the front lawn and i kept an eye out for when he was next out in his yard so i could talk to him.

&#x200b;

i reviewed the footage over the next few days and, sure enough, he was consistently taking his dog to do the deed in our yard. why our yard? no clue, we've never had any interaction with this guy whatsoever. the next time i saw him walking to his car, i confronted him. i simply told him that i knew he was taking his dog to shit in our yard and if i caught him doing it again i'd call the police to report him for trespassing. he denied doing it, claiming it must be other neighbors, got in his car, and drove away with me standing in his driveway.

&#x200b;

so i review the footage from the last few days. dude is not walking his dog into my yard anymore: he's letting the dog shit in his yard. he then scoops it up, walks it across the street, and tosses it into my yard with a shovel. what the absolute fuck.

&#x200b;

how do i even begin handling this?",2
"my (26m) girlfriend (24f) found an engagement ring i was keeping safe for my friend until he was ready to propose. she thought it was for her and is furious that it wasn't.. i've been dating my girlfriend laura for just over two years. we met as i was finishing my masters and she was in her last year of undergrad as we attended the same university. we have a pretty strong relationship overall, we get along well and have pretty similar views/goals in life, and i love her a great deal. she's definitely been the healthiest relationship i've ever had and i see a strong future with her. 

this weekend has been awful, however. my best friend rob came to me about a month ago and told me that he had a plan to propose to his long term girlfriend grace of about seven years. the problem was that they live together and she's a very clean person, and he was afraid she might find the ring while cleaning before he was ready to propose. i offered to hide it for him at my house until he was ready, and he handed it over. i hid it in the back of my sock drawer and honestly kind of forgot about it until last monday when he asked for it back. he (successfully!) proposed to grace yesterday, and she posted a picture of the two of them on her instagram with the ring clearly visible.

literally five minutes after she posted, laura rang me absolutely fuming. she told me she'd found that ring three weeks ago, so why had i given it to rob for grace when i'd clearly chosen it especially for her? was grace mocking her with her post, just rubbing her nose into the fact that she'd ""stolen"" her ring? i tried to talk her down and explain that i'd just been keeping it safe for rob and that i'd never intended to propose to her with it but that only made her more upset and she starting screaming at me that i'd absolutely built up her hopes and just destroyed them. she hung up on me, then texted me that i had three months to propose to her with ""a better ring than grace's"" or she's going to break up with me. 

am i wrong for thinking this is a red flag? i know that she probably was really excited and i absolutely never meant to hurt her feelings with all of this, but the ring was never for her and she never should have known about it. we don't live together and i don't know what she was doing snooping in my drawers, or when she had the time to look in there, or what she was looking for her. more than that, i am 100% not ready for marriage. we've only been together for two years, haven't lived together, haven't even talked about marriage yet. i want to be living together for at least a year before we get engaged. 

what do i do? i totally understand why she'd be upset but i just feel like she's invaded my privacy by looking through my stuff, and that i'm being treated badly for something that was never meant as a snub towards her. this is the first big fight we've had and i'm not sure if i'm just seeing red flags because i'm hurt, or if they're really there. 

tl;dr: girlfriend snooped and found a ring that i was keeping safe for a friend. she's angry that the ring wasn't for her, is demanding a proposal by valentine's day or the relationship's off. need help determining what my next move should be.",8

"for buying an extra airline seat (and utilizing it) even though i don't need it?. i hate flying to the point that i will gladly drove 10-15 hours to avoid a 4 hour flight. it's not that i'm scared of flying, i just hate everything from the security theater to the cramped seats that leave me sore for days.

so i only fly if i can buy a second seat (or third if i'm flying with my wife). it lets me stretch my legs out if needed, not feel trapped mentally, and not sit next to annoying people etc. also a second seat is almost always cheaper than business/first class and for some reason they refund you if the flight isn't full. i'm a big guy but i 100% don't need two seats, gate agents are constantly baffled and one even said ""you're not nearly big enough to need 2 seats"".

on multiple flights i've had to argue with flight attendants and randoms that no i bought the second seat, and if they oversold the flight/some 400 lb guy didn't buy the second seat he needs and is killing his seatmate it's not my problem. 

for never backing down in this scenario that has happened 6-7 times at this point? if i was willing to fly with one seat i wouldn't have bought a second seat.

note - i do not take two seats on the train/bus ever. they are way more comfortable and you can stand whenever etc so i don't feel cramped and trapped like on a plane.",3

"often, being liked doesn't require you to be interesting/funny. it just requires you to make other people feel interesting/funny.. i'm not saying people never gain pleasure from others being interesting or funny. but the fact is in most interactions, everybody is heavily self-monitoring and will base their judgement of the success of the interaction on how people responded to *them*. if people laughed at their joke. if people found their anecdote interesting or shocking. if people agreed with their opinion. 

so the upshot for people who are shy or worry that they're boring is: you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself. honestly most times all you need to do is take an interest in whoever you're talking to. listen. ask questions/follow-up questions. laugh at their jokes. and they'll come out of it thinking you were a really cool person to talk to, when actually what they mean is you made *them* feel like a really cool person to talk to. 

edit: for those saying isn't this just ego-stroking or being fake, it's not about sucking up to the other person at all. it's just empowering you to worry less about what you're saying, because the other person is almost certainly experiencing you in terms of how you respond to what they say anyway.

"for spraying the neighborhood kids with my garden hose?. i love strawberries. i love them so much that i planted 300 strawberry plants in my garden. after i harvest, i make lots of strawberry jelly to give to my family, friends, and neighbors. i donate the leftovers to my local food bank.

lately i've had a big problem with all the neighborhood kids coming in my yard and stealing my strawberries. the last time i caught them i threatened them with the police because they was so reckless they smashed over 50 of my plants.

i caught them in my yard again this afternoon, instead of calling the police i grabbed my garden hose and sprayed them while chasing them out of my yard.

"for telling my parents i won't drive my brother to school unless he is more hygienic because his smell literally makes me sick?. i'm a high school senior and my brother is a high school freshman. i have a car that i bought with money i'd saved from work, and i pay my own gas. however my parents pay my car insurance, so they said that driving is a privilege for me, not a right.

they said i need to drive my brother to school even though there's a bus. and the problem is that i get motion sick easily; even when i'm driving. too much driving makes me vomit, and bad smells when i'm in a car make me feel ill too.

i'm not exaggerating, i've always been like this. as a kid, my family couldn't go on vacation without me puking at least once. i always make sure i know where my barf bag is on a plane. i always used to take motion sickness pills, but i'm not allowed when i'm driving because they make you tired.

anyway, i can handle the drive to school on my own fine, but when my brother is with me i literally feel so sick because of his bo. even with the windows on my side open

my friend told me i should make a checklist of what my brother needs to do before getting in my car in the morning: have a shower with shampoo and soap, brush his teeth, put on deodorant, wear clean clothes including underwear and socks, remember to use shoe antifungal spray. 

right now, he doesn't do that, he likes to sleep in to the last minute, skip showers most days, pick clothes up off the floor to wear, skip brushing his teeth, etc.

so i did that and told my mom and dad that i couldn't do it anymore unless my brother had done the hygiene list in the morning. either they could check or i would. and they blew up at me saying that i was being nasty and humiliating, that if i wouldn't drive my brother i couldn't drive. and i said fine; i'll go back to riding my bicycle to school or getting a ride from my friend.

and that caused a big fight, because i guess they were not expecting me to call their bluff and give up driving.

"returned a $1,175 computer back to walmart and they refuse to refund the money.. hi all! so i put a gaming comp on layaway with walmart a few weeks ago so i could make payments versus $1,000+ at once.

well it immediately locked her account for fraud, so we called the walmart money people and they said all we needed to do was submit the receipt as proof. 

we did and called back and the lady said that the receipt wasn't good enough?? she said that it had a ""different balance"" on all the receipts but that's because it was layaway and i made payments!

"i(22m) recently discovered my dad (50m) choose me over my former stepmother and half-sister(17f) 6 years ago. don't know how to process this.. i was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. when i was sent to live with my dad, i was broken. i barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  i wasn't mad or angry. i was null of any kind of emotion. basically i was alive but wasn't living. i kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. i was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. i was more social with my dad but i kept it to a bare minimum.  i had noting left to say to anyone. it took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. that's how withdrawn i had become.

dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  when i experienced night- terrors, i would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  he drove me to all of my therapist appointments. he made sure i was eating properly. there were days, i would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. he literally went above and beyond for me. i hated the city that were living in. because  i had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

i was so passive, it was scary. my therapist had told my dad that i was stuck in the victim's cycle; i didn't know how to get out. because of this, i was bullied quite a bit. by the time i was 15, i had been to 3 different schools. it got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. i was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. noting would motivate me.

looking back, dad did spoil me but at the time i wasn't aware of it. i was so in my own body that i barley acknowledged my surroundings.   if i asked my dad for a new bed spread, i would get me new one plus new furniture. my phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. i was grateful and thanked him. i did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. again i was being polite. i didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. i barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

by the time i was 16, dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. i didn't question it. he had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. i didn't think it was any of my business so i didn't press the issue. a year later, dad had divorced my stepmother. one of dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in boston and he took it. we moved and i felt i was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. that year was probably the best year of my life. i was coming out of my shell. there was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. it was if i was like everyone else. i felt ""normal"". i became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, i was going out more. us moving probably saved my life.

because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. there was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. you could just sense it. it got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

me and dad have always been close. when i had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, i could see my dad crying in the crowd. i lived with my dad while i attended college ( i still do for the time being) . ever since i was child, i always wanted to be a doctor. well, i just finished my first year of medical school. honestly, i feel like a normal young adult in society. i have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom i've been with for 4 years. i'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

recently, i got fb message from my half-sister. she was apologizing a lot and i had no clue what she was talking about. turns out, the reason why dad and i moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what i was watching her change........... yes. she told her mom that i was watching her change.. at the time, i was traumatized of sex. heck i was terrified of any form of intimacy. the kid was envious of what dad was doing for me. she was so envious that she tried to move me out. well i guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and i'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. because we moved out, i think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. how can someone be so cruel? what did i ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. i didn't even respond. more importantly, dad never let this to get back to me. chances are if i had heard about this when i was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. it also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

this is a lot to take in and i have a new found of respect and love for my dad. he gave up this marriage for me so i could live a normal life.dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. i'm missing him a lot lately.

should i bring it up to him when he returns? also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? at the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and i almost want to help.

tl;dr: dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. dad kept it from me for 6 years. should i bring up with him?

edit: i wasn't expecting such a huge response. i just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. it will take some time but i will read all of them or as much as i can. as i was going through the comments, i found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. this a part of my life. i don't normally like to talk about about this . aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. the fact the people are saying that it's fake.... i don't what to say. it's not my place to try and convince anyone. believe  me, they're times i wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. when i wrote this, i wasn't thinking about syntax. it was more just getting this out. people questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. forgive me but i wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

as for how i became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; i did respond to it in the comments but i'll post it here too. 

""it was very unorthodox how i became valedictorian after attending a real hs for only a year. my overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because i was in online classes for my previous hears, i wasn't eligible at the time. i met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

i broke down in front of the coordinator and i told her the truth. being named valedictorian was something i always wanted. to be that would have been my first accomplishment that i would have achieved based on my own merit. yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. it wasn't trying to be valedictorian financial reasons. money wasn't a problem (dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. this would have helped me self-worth as well.

the girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and i told her the truth. she actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. it something i'll forever be grateful for. that's actually how me and her became friends."". not many people would do that and in hs. 

i'll be posting again. i just need a few days.",8
"update overheard my girlfriend say she would leave me for someone taller. original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cvz1jc/overheard_my_girlfriend_say_she_would_leave_me/)

so i read all the comments on my last post and even after breaking up with my girlfriend, i was doubting if i made the right decesion. i wasn't going to update because i didn't see a reason to do it, but after the the last couple days i came to a final conclusion.i want to clarify that i broke up with my girlfriend because of how easy it was for her to disrespect me behind my back, not because of the actual height difference.

after i broke up with her she continued to apologize to me. she would send me letters and call me a lot. in one of the texts i actually responded to, she asked if we could meet up and talk. without going into to much detail, she wanted a second chance and overall sounded very remorseful. i was about to agree, but something she said made me realize i would be making a mistake if i did. she said, ""i'll remember to respect from now on."" that sentence made me realize that i made the right choice by breaking up. since when do you have to be reminded to have the bare minimum of respect for your partner?

either way i'm glad i didn't give her a second chance. i don't know if any of you care at this point, but there's the update.

on a sidenote, the other day i was hanging out with one of my female friends who happens to be taller and i guess she saw us and started texting me that ""she doesn't need me,"" started saying that my friend was a pig and that i moved on to fast. blocked her and had a laugh i know for a fact i made the right choice.",8
"by getting google to ban our entire company while on the toilet. **tldr; company uses google accounts that are all connected. i fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the google account, and all associated accounts. everyone in my company is now blocked by google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. google isn't helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**

preface, this happened on friday and is still on-going. i've tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so i won't be outed since i guarantee someone will read this eventually. i still do not know if i am the culprit, but i am 90% sure that i am. i feel like this is a fireable offence and i will step up and take it if it comes to that. i'm also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.

i work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. we migrated to gmail and other google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. it's safe to say that everyone is using gmail or google in one way or another. now, our gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.

i have a friend who creates android apps on the side. i do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called titanium backup. 

as a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), i buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. after that, i send him an e-mail with the cloned version through gmail with something along the lines of: ""look at this cool app i found on the store, it was completely free! try it out!"", or stupid shit like that. it was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.

recently he uploaded a new app and i did the same thing as usual. i was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. i was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. i e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.

about an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their google accounts. at the time, it didn't click with me what had happened.

one of my colleagues requested help and i went to check it out. it turns out that their account was blocked by google due to tos violations. their google payments account was blocked as well. i thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. we got banned by google, all of us. 

the afternoon was pandemonium. we were all freaking out, our it guys were trying to get a hold of google but couldn't get in touch with anyone. we could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. all our work was shared with google services.

eventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. it wasn't until yesterday that someone made the connection. anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. one of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn't access her e-mail either.

anyways, we were all told to go home on friday. i went home and looked this up myself, and i found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the google payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. it bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how i said all our work accounts were connected?

yeah...

so it's been two days now and we've been chatting over skype, no one knows what happened and the it guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that google isn't helping us out. their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. the posts i've found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...

so yeah, that's that. i'm 99% sure that i am the culprit who caused this. i do not know why google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but i fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. i might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.

**edit1:** this blew up pretty quickly. luckily, i have 3 pms from people close to, or reps who can help me out. if i missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. i am in touch with one of them now and i am getting in touch with it at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. i will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out.

"update: she20f lost her virginity while we were taking a break. original: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f\_lost\_her\_virginity\_while\_we\_were\_taking\_a/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/atuxe9/she20f_lost_her_virginity_while_we_were_taking_a/?sort=new)

hey guys. first of all, thank you all so much for your responses, it really did affect me.

so, long story short, 3 days ago i ""broke up"" with her for good.

now, you guys might not agree with the way i did it, but i did not want to have revenge sex with her, hurt her or hurt her ego. even though i am sad and disappointed, at the same time i understand she wanted to see other options and i respect she didn't outright cheat on me. that being said, i am also not a backup plan and i deserve to be someones first plan, someone that will make love with me and not consider it a ""godly gift to me""...

i didn't see her anymore and i finished it with a message, here's a translated version:

""hey \name\, first of all, i don't want to hold you in suspense, so yes, this is my final break-up message. i took some days to think about it and i realized that if we did continue where we left off that the other guy would be in my head non-stop and i would always be paranoid of you doing it again when you get bored of me. i understand we were (and still are) young when we started our relationship and that you wanted to explore other options and gain experience. sadly, in that process you lost my trust and hurt me greatly. i respect you wanted to ""take a break"" instead of cheating on me but that still doesn't make it justifiable. i wanted to thank you for all those years and i wanted to apologize for any wrongs i did to you. i want you to know that i am not mad or sad and that my head is the right place. i hope that going forward you will be okay too and please don't punish yourself for what you did. goodbye, op""

the message was supposed to be stronger and stuff, but i realized i am already getting over it and that i no longer see the point of putting more effort and thought into it. she replied with an equally long message saying she is sorry bla bla bla. so, thank you guys for opening my eyes, if it weren't for you, i am almost certain that i would accept her back. so yeah, until next time.",8

"deepthroating myself in front of my new assistant.. the update!!(https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)

&#x200b;

ohhhhh where do i begin. this happened this weekend.

let's lay out some plot points first..

\-i'm 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. she is 26.

\-i work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. i've recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.

\-i've always worked out, done yoga, i'm fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. this combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. i've been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. i know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, i've done it a lot and i know what i'm doing, lol.

&#x200b;

okay. so, the girl i am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. one of whom is getting married soon. she was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. i was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it's all in good fun, so fuck it, right? i agree to the plan. i was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.

&#x200b;

there are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, ""deepest"" of which is to put my legs over my head. this way, i would be looking up, and wouldn't really have to look at any of the girls. but the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (i can draw a diagram if needed.)

&#x200b;

so the day comes, i have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. by the time i arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like ""suck your dick!"" from the other room. i prepare myself with the girl i'm dating, and she invites her friends in. they are hooting and hollaring as i'm laying on the ground with a very erect cock. the whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, i'm really into this idea now.

&#x200b;

i throw my legs over my head as i've done many time, and start to play along with the ""show""... i circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. i put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and i hear the ghasps and woo's and girl noises coming from behind me. i'm trying to look back to see them, but i'm a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can't see past my head. i start getting more and more into it, and the girl i'm dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we've done before in our own private world. at this point i'm really into and sucking my cock like a champ. the girls really seem to be enjoying it.

&#x200b;

after a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting ""cum in your mouth! cum in your mouth!""... now to be clear, i normally don't do this. i have before, lol, but it's not my thing. but i'm the entertainment, and i aim to please, so in my mind i'm thinking lets do this. i start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. the girl i'm dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. the whole thing is so hot and i feel like i'm about to cum, and.....explode. it was a lot. i'm shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. the girl i'm dating let's go of my legs and i fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. her friends start to yell -- ""kiss him!"" ""cum swap!"" - i'm actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. so i stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and i look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. my assistant.

&#x200b;

she leaves the room, i race to the bathroom. the girl i'm dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and i tell her. she loses it laughing - ""so and so is your assistant?! ahahahah"". i'm not laughing. assistant isn't laughing and actually leaves the party.

&#x200b;

it's actually a bit of a scene, the girl i'm dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling assistant and she is not answering. the girl i'm dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.

&#x200b;

i've been working from home all week. i've talked to my assistant via slack and we've said nothing. she is in the office. i can't work from home tomorrow. i don't know what the fuck to do. the girl i'm dating said that assistant is mortified, and doesn't know what to do either. i really don't know what the fuck to do.

&#x200b;

tl:dr - i sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. we haven't spoken about it since.

&#x200b;

edit:  the diagram(https://imgur.com/a/rr31ebi)!  i'm a terrible artist, forgive me.  i'm not a turkey, i promise.

edit 2: to clarify, i don't think she was mortified at what she was watching.  i think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  the diagram above is meant to show that they couldn't really see my face until i stood up.  at least this is the logic i am convincing myself of.

edit 3:  i'm being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and ""a girl i am dating"" because honestly i wouldn't do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  i don't think either of us see a future in this relationship, we're just having fun.

edit 4:  yes, they were staring at my butthole.  i'm well groomed, no one seemed to mind. to be honest if,

edit 5:

since everyone is asking, i'll offer my thoughts.  no, i'm not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  it's my own dick, so i think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  by your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you've touched a dick like 10 times today at least.

as for the ""i've heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked"" - i bring it back to the above statement.  a handjob obviously doesn't feel the same as jerking off.  kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  i think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you ""with a friend who told you"" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  but it's become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  better than jerking off that's for sure.

and yes, i have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.

thanks for coming to my ted talk.",4
"update: old coworkers are telling me my old boss talks to them about ""all the issues i'm having."" found out my therapist is my old boss's husband. (mn). original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/anlpqr/old_coworkers_are_telling_me_my_old_boss_talks_to/)

&#x200b;

**old post summary**: my old boss was telling my old team that i was having a ton of issues. i found out my therapist is her husband, but i didn't know how she was finding this out/to what degree each person was doing bad stuff.

&#x200b;

**new developments summary**: there's still a lot of slow/bureaucratic stuff going on, but the most satisfying news is that *my therapist is no longer practicing*. i even saw the space he practiced out of listed as for sale on a real estate website while doing my own house hunting.

&#x200b;

**new developments, continued**: therapist was chatting about a client (me) to his wife (my old boss) that, it seemed, he really didn't know was his wife's old employee (large company, closely knit but not minuscule industry). i have a very peculiar family dynamic, so i think he talked about that. however, enough bits and pieces of identifying info came up that she suspected it was me. unbeknownst to him, she found my paper records in his office and dug through them, then thought it was a great idea to tell my old coworkers that i was depressed and had family issues. neat. one of my coworkers put in her two weeks because of a relocating spouse shortly after, then agreed to write a formal statement of what she heard, which also helped a lot. understandably, no one else was willing to because the company's already laid off so many people in the last year.

&#x200b;

**resolution-in-process**: therapist seems to be less in the wrong than i thought he was (though still in the wrong), old boss is still awful. therapist likely to receive some sort of reprimanding for both talking to his wife about me in that level of detail, as well as insecure recordkeeping. i don't know if he'll practice again.

&#x200b;

***thank you all -*** you were a huge help, and a confidence boost that me complaining about this would actually get it somewhere and not just create more stress in my life. it's apparently led to a ton of drama at my old workplace, which has been sort of pleasant to hear updates about from afar. glad to not be there anymore. i also found a new therapist who's great, and she's really helped validate that the old guy (and his wife) was one bag egg in a sea of otherwise well-meaning people.",2

"minnesota: landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. what now?. for some background i am renting an apartment and my lease ends on september 30th. my landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. i do have a lease that says i get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which i believe is the law itself, but in this case i did not get that notice.

last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8am saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). he asked if i could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing i'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

i did not see these messages until i took lunch at 12. i texted my landlord back saying i thought i am supposed to get notice for entry and i'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though i'm sure that doesn't legally count).

long story short they robbed me and i have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. they took everything of value such as laptop and tv and even some stupid things like my lamps.

my renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and i should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. he met them at dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. i told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place i would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

what now? push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? i would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",2

"by letting my girlfriends dad use my laptop nsfw. so today i had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, i'm still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn't make one hell of a story for you all

okay so for a bit of back story i'm 27 and i live with my girlfriend, we've been together for 2 years now and through out that time i've seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they're usually travelling so it's a little harder to spend time with them. now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and i for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. we've also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....

so on top of making porn i'm also an aspiring film editor and i am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but i also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us i'd been editing a new video, usually after editing i go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.

now fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because i'd always got the vibe they didn't like me very much. we were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, i immediately said sure and led him into the office, now i could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and i kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. so i lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as i opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst i ejaculated on her face, if that's not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.

i panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn't want her dad getting us sick also.

her dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and i are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but i hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and i'll keep you updated if anything else happens 



tl;dr i unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won't talk to us

update: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so i'll explain, as i said earlier in the post i watch the video post editing to make sure there's no problems before uploading, before going to sleep i just shut the laptop without even thinking, i do this often (i know it's not good but sshh) if you don't stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. still haven't heard from her dad yet. i honestly didn't expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and i laugh a lot so thank you

"for selling my daughter's car after discovering her texting & driving?. when my daughter was 14, wife and i decided we would buy a car for her to use on her 16th if she proved herself to be responsible, got good grades, etc. there would be a ""contract"" of sorts to ensure we were all on the same page. the stipulations were continuing good grades, good attitude, she could only bring one friend with her somewhere (to begin with), we had to know where she was, and the obvious two: don't drink & drive, and don't text and drive. 

we made it clear that **we** were buying the car, but it was for her to use. we got the car, a 2012 honda civic. she has a summer job right now, it's summer break so she's out doing stuff with her friends, etc. in a few months she will be off to college. everything was going swimmingly. until someone on that nextdoor app started posting pictures and videos of bad drivers in the area. and lo and behold, my daughter was posted with her face down as she texted and rolled through a stop sign. once with her face down in her phone at a stoplight. i was livid. my wife was the one who showed it to me. we found out there were more instances (from her instagram stories) and we decided... no.

wife and i up and sold the car. we didn't lose very much in the process, except of course our daughter completely came unraveled. it's so unfair, i didn't hurt anyone, everyone's doing it, how am i supposed to get to work, what about when i go to college? well, we said no, it's not unfair, you hurt us by being a shitty, irresponsible driver, no, not everyone's doing it, you can walk, ride your bike, or take the bus, and as for college, you don't need the car to get to and from classes, and again, ride your bike or walk. she tried to play the ""how can you send your daughter to college without her safety in mind?"" card and i said ""well, well, well, now you're concerned about safety?"" and she just up and screamed. 

this has everyone in our life up in arms and divided. her grandparents think we're being over the top and awful, that grounding her would have sufficed. they've threatened that they will buy her a car again if we try to send her to college without one. 

the car is already sold, so there's no going back. i think what we did was absolutely correct, that actions have consequences and we would be in the wrong to pull back from that. in terms of her going to college? well, she made that choice. she had a car, it came with certain stipulations, she disobeyed us, and now she pays the price.

"boyfriend and i slept through gas leak that evacuated our entire building except us. landlady basically said if we don't like it we could move out. this happened in ontario, canada.

so this past friday, our entire apartment building was evacuated after a ""bum like person"" (landlady's words) broke into the building and busted a gas pipe at around midnight. 

i found out about it the next night at work (i work across the street from our building and we're open pretty late) when my coworker asked where my boyfriend and i were the night before. he filled me in on what had happened and that everyone was outside, there were fire trucks, cops, the works. 

for more context, on the 24th of october a fire marshal inspected our alarm that's connected to the building and said it needed to be replaced. it has yet to be replaced and when my boyfriend confronted our landlady via text she refused to give us a copy of order for our replacement alarm, blamed us for not hearing the commotion and waking up (i sleep with ear plugs and boyfriend is a heavy sleeper) didn't apologize, and told us if we don't feel comfortable she'd make arrangements for us to move out. 

all we asked for was the alarm for our unit. luckily neither us or our cats are hurt or anything, but if the gas leak had been anymore serious we could've died in our sleep that night. 

boyfriend's dad is a real estate agent and the first thing he cited was the law that landlords need to have an evacuation plan for *all* tenants and units. 

i dislike confrontation and feel like we were too harsh in our texts, but we could have died if it were more serious. my dad is telling me to report the landlady to the tenant tribunal or the fire department. but i don't know. came here for advice from third parties or someone who knows more about tenant law in ontario. 

edit: more direct questions; should we pursue action and report? if we do pursue reporting them, could they evict us? i know it wouldn't be legal for them to evict us over reporting them, but the fear is still in my mind. i could also post the screen shots of the text conversation if anyone would like to read them.

tldr: boyfriend and i were only tenants not evacuated during a gas leak and landlady refuses to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. basically told us she'd rather us move out than fix our alarm.

"for choosing my brother over my marriage?. my parents divorced when i was 3, and went into separate marriages. i had a rough childhood being split between two different households, it was really messy and made me not want children at all. when i was 20, my parents reconciled after their second marriages had ended and had my brother soon after. i had already been dating my now-wife for a year, and we were eventually married, she agreed with me about not wanting kids.

five years later and my brother is now 6, and all is not well in my parents marriage. my mother had an unexpected hard attack and died. my father did not take it well, and drank himself to death. obviously my family is morning, and i've been trying to find a home for my brother, none of my half-siblings want him.

the only other option would be for him to go into foster care, and i'm not going to let that happen. i told my wife that i was going to become his guardian, and that she did not have to stick around in this marriage if she didn't want to. she did not take it well and is furious that i would choose my brother over her. i doubt my marriage will survive, but i can't let my brother go into foster care.

"for lying about my biggest fear on a quiz show and subsequently winning a car and making other contestants lose?. this is a hot topic in my family at the moment, 

i live on an obscure little island near the uk. we have a local quiz show that's aired on the telly that i appeared on a few years ago. 

the premise of the show is that you can win prizes for doing challenges. some of the challenges were physical, some psychological, and some requiring problem solving skills. i sailed through a lot of the physical part because i wasn't a fat bastard back then, and the problem solving skills required a lot of maths which is my career, so i was ok there.

as for the psychological part, you had to enter a clear box 'room' filled with something you're terrified of, and search through to find clues to the next part. 

i thought of a believable lie before i entered the show (we had to list 5 things we were afraid of) and i put down all the things i'm *not* scared of. i listed spiders, cockroaches, snakes, scorpions, and wood lice. i literally couldn't care less about any of these creatures. i grew up in rural landscape and i've had to pretty much deal with creepy crawlies my entire life so it's not an issue. my actual fear is a bit more obscure and i really honestly knew i'd fail if i was put in a room with it. 

when i entered the room there were cockroaches *everywhere* i was in my boxers and barefoot (which was incredibly gross i can't lie) and had to sift through and move the cockroaches to find clues for my next challenge.

i did it in the time period ascribed to me and got through to the next part. the rest of the contestants failed.

now, i won a pretty average car which i didn't particularly want, so as soon as i legally could i sold it and made a nice profit since it was pretty much brand new and bought myself a rather nicer car.

i told my family this recently on a drunken night when we were all at a get together, and although everybody found it uproariously funny, my family are split into 2 camps- some people think i cheated and was ethically and morally wrong, and other people think the other contestants deserved to lose if they listed their *actual* fears.

i'm obviously in the latter category, but genuinely wondering what others think.",3

"for cancelling my wedding because fiancee almost got my dog killed?. me (28m) and fiancee (27f) have been together for 4 years, engaged for 6 months. i also have a 7 year-old lab mix who is the greatest dog in existence.

on saturday, fiancee had a bachelorette party at home. i stayed with my parents but i left the dog with her because she likes having him there. however, *i made sure to tell her to put the dog in our bedroom once the party gets going*.

5am on sunday i get a frantic call that something's wrong with the dog. she was drunk, so i told her to get a taxi and go to the emergency vet clinic. when i got there, she looked like she hadn't stopped crying for hours and she couldn't even speak. two of her friends were there so they told me my dog is alive but not well. i felt sorry for her for an entire 10 minutes while waiting for the doctor.

but then, the doctor told me my dog ingested large amounts of alcohol and chocolate edibles. the girls apparently thought it would be cool to leave everything out on short coffee tables, leave the dog to wander around instead of putting him in our bedroom, and then get wasted and not notice he was going to town with the booze and edibles.

when we got home, i told my fiancee to pack and get out of my house and my life. i told her to tell her guests the wedding is off, and i'll tell mine. she was shocked, but she took her things and left.

2 hours later, i get bombarded by messages on messenger, whatsapp, by her sisters, brother, brother's wife, her mom, her friends, telling me that i am insane to do this to her after 4 years. they started off defending her, but it quickly turned into insulting me.

the logical thing for me to do was look for comfort in my friends and family. nope. they all fucking agree. my mom said: ""well, it was a mistake, she didn't do it on purpose, besides - the dog didn't die!"" lucky me, eh? my dog didn't fucking die!

my sister was appalled that i cancelled the wedding ""over *that*?!"" and even my best man said i might have overreacted. yes, our relationship has had ups and downs, but it's mostly worked fine. but i am so disgusted at my fiancee that i can't even imagine looking her in the eye, let alone spending my whole life with her. she isn't fucking 17, she is 27!

by the way, this is not the first dumb thing she has done. she likes to text while driving, she always leaves stuff on the electric stove (like kitchen towels, the cutting board etc.) even though she has turned on the wrong burner and burnt whatever was on it several times in the past, and similar dangerous things. it's not something i hold against her in the sense that i would ever mention in a fight, but i'd be lying if i said i wasn't worried that she might end up killing herself or someone else. for example, my dog.

i'm 99% sure i will stand by my decision. but am i really an asshole? literally nobody is on my side and i have no idea what to think.

&#x200b;

**edit: posting here kind of triggered me to conclude this isn't about the dog at all. she is negligent and irresponsible and i don't want to stick around and possibly see our child die in a car accident some day because she was texting or she forgot to put his seat belt on. i'd rather be an asshole now than spend years of my life worrying every time our child is left alone with her. if she'd accidentally killed a person while texting and driving, i would also leave her. i guess i realized i don't want to spend my life with someone who has such blatant disregard for human (or animal) life.**",3

"dealing with horrible and loud neighbors that are painting me as a racist in texas. how do i protect myself legally?. i have lived in my apartment for 3 years and never had a real problem with my neighbors. a few months ago some new people moved in the apartment above mine. 

the last few months have been hell. they have parties every night even week nights that never end before 3am. they are loud way past our community quiet hours. they have some sort of bass they like to turn on that literally shakes the ceiling (their floor). i have recorded it. it wakes up my 2 year old. do you know how hard it is to get a 2 year old back to sleep during a loud upstairs party. 

they leave trash outside their door for days so that smells and drips down. it has ruined my outdoor rug. i took pictures. 

they drop cigarette butts from above right on to my porch. 

they regularly park in the reserved spot i pay for monthly. it is a special fee not everyone pays but the apartment offers reserved spots. they are an extra $50 a month. the minute i leave they pull their car there and refuse to move until i threaten to involve the apt. manager.

they have a gigantic pairs of dogs that are aggressive and they let them run around without a leash even though the apartment has a leash policy and the city does too. 

they like to empty their bleach another cleaning supply water over the railing and directly on to the front stoop of my apartment door. i have 3 times walked out to sticky pinesol or the alarming and strong smell of bleach  all over my front walkway. it ruined my potted plants outside. 

i have reported all the incidents. i have tried to ask them to cut it out. they don't care. 

i recently called the police nonemergency line about the noise and it turns out i am not the first to complain that day. the police came out and found some illegal drugs in the apartment or on one of their guests (i am not sure of how it was found. i stayed in my apartment)  and arrested someone. 

since then they have taken to recording me any time i leave my apartment. they have been calling me racist and threatening to put it in the internet and get me fired. 

the woman of the couple has followed me to my car with my child in my arms and yelled about how i am impeding her ability to exist in public because i am racist. she says i call the police on her for doing nothing. i only called the police about a noise complaint at 1am because they were having a loud party and had refused my request at 12am to maybe keep it down a little because my daughter was trying to sleep. 

i understand i am white and as such have no idea of the struggle. i would never dream of telling them how to live life. 

i just don't want them to leave trash that seeps down my front door (leaving trash outside is against apartment policy) and ruins my things, park in the spot i pay for monthly, and play loud music i can clearly hear in my home during quiet hours. 

she had thrown  her dogs poop bags at my car. 

they have really upped the bleach game too. it has gotten on a few spots on my door and i am scared they might throw it at my car. 

i have asked my apartment to move me but it isn't feasible right now. i can't break the lease for at least 3 more months. 

i can't lose my job and i am not sure how protect myself legally. 

they are actually my paid space right now but i am scared to have them towed because i don't know what they are going to do. i pay for that space. i have proof. the sticker on the front inside window matches the marked spot. 

if i tell the apartment they will have the car towed but i'll look like a racist. 

all it takes is one video and a lie and i am ruined. 

i want to add that there are racist out there who deserve to be called out and the overwhelming majority of those videos are true and tragic and the white person in those videos deserves all the bad things that happen to them but i think wanting to be able to sleep in the early morning hours and park in my own space that i pay for is reasonable. but maybe not?",2

"by making a joke and losing the right to see my daughter. this just happened last week. i got home from working out of town thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. ""beth"" comes in and i can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. she feels fine though. 

i am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. i wake beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. it is more than half closed and a little red. she still feels fine. as soon as the doctor opens, i call them and they tell us to come in.  

we get there and i go to check in. the receptionist that i have never seen looks at my daughter and says ""oh. my goodness, what happened?""  so i respond as a joke ""eh, she got out of line"".   

i know!  it's horrible. i'm sorry!  i have a weird sense of humor and i'm a bit socially awkward.  anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  soon we are called in. the checkup goes as expected. it's a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter zyrtec or benadryl.  then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. 

he comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. the doctor is angry. we all head to the doctor's office to talk.  

there is a policeman and a policewoman. the policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. my daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  so she says no and buries her face in my side.  the police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. i saw one of beth's cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. the doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. 

the police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. the doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. he just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  i now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  she makes an excuse and leaves the room. he says that he thinks he has to let her go. he says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. he says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. 

the police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if i can come to the station.  a friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. 

we get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   the police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. they say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  i call my wife who goes ballistic.  

the county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if i sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. my uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. i stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that i really don't need to make for this week.  i can't wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but i'm pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.

thank you for the gold kind strangers.
wow this blew up.  i wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  i want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  for those of you saying that i am an idiot, you are probably right.

1) i will not be sleeping on the couch.  my wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  at least not at me.

2) i am heading home from boston tomorrow evening and i think everything should be resolved by then.

3) i will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  she was very young did not do this out of animosity. i do not know what if anything will happen to her job. i am not pushing for her to lose it.  

4) the other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  a few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  these lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  the receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state's department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   the dep closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for ""clean up"".  it turned out to be nothing.",4
"by letting my boyfriend have control over the lube.. we are in the middle of the polar vortex. i got a phone call last night saying that i didn't have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.

we decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. i was ready to get laid, because, well, i wanted to. so i told my boyfriend to grab the lube while i climbed on top of him.

the bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it like this(https://i.imgur.com/llijq5v.jpg). i was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.

because he was holding the bottle of lube it's right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. he squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn't turn it sideways, it didn't work. again, we were drunk, so shit happens.

while he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. he couldn't get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as i screamed and jumped off him.  the bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.

i now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. we sobered up real quick, i fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.

i decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. she immediately noticed like within ten minutes after i'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so i didn't beat around the bush, i said yes because i didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. she tried to guilt trip me about how i hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like i knew they would). she exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but i hadn't even gotten a chance to say i was worried she'd do this. she said it first so what does that say?

i told her i flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. she called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. i can't reason with her. she just never sees the problem with anything she's done. the way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

i blocked her number, i still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. but we live hours apart, so i figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

then, as for them, i also got a call from my mom soon after i blocked my sister who wanted to know what i was doing because she was upset. she'd already heard my sister's side which was just that i'd blocked her out of nowhere. so i tried to tell her my side. i did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like i said in the first post i'm not going to fall to petty revenge. i just want her to stop interfering in my life. so all i said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys i've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. my mom then wanted to know what i meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). she also got my dad on the call at this point. i told them the details didn't matter. she kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if i had been having premarital sex. it was really frustrating. 

i told them the point i'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. they began saying i should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. well i'm not exactly fighting. i'm simply not going to be in contact with her. to them it's the same thing. 

then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. i said i wasn't going to do that, that i'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. they said they'd come to me then. that brought up how they show up for random visits even when i've said i don't like it. i told them i didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again i wouldn't let them in or talk with them. so they flipped out, that was fun, i got to hear all how i'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

i ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. and blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

i don't know wtf i'm going to do about them. they did threaten to stop paying for my college if i cut them out of my life. i unblocked them to say i want to be in touch with them and do love them but i can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. i said if they stop doing that then i'm happy to have a relationship with them. they had a million reasons why i'm in the wrong. i couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. so i don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

my boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. he thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. he's really helped keep me as sane as i can be. 

overall i just feel really shitty. i wish any of them would ever listen to what i say. but if they won't then what can i do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. it just sucks it has to be so...final, i guess. i wouldn't mind a middle ground like planning a visit with them once in a while, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than i do. 

tl;dr: i'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",8

"by matching with my homophobic uncle on grindr. so i have an uncle (we will call him j) who has always been very vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. there is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn't say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.

well this weekend in between family gatherings i was looking to meet somebody . i started chatting with an older man because that's how i roll. a lot of older guys don't like to show their faces because they aren't out so i don't think much of it when he doesn't show me his face. we actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics i wish i could unsee and sending a few i wish i could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.

so i'm at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . it is at this moment i realize my fu, i've been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  he tried to play it off like a random encounter but i wasn't letting him get away with that. after some pressing he finally admits that he is the man i've been talking to and i told him i don't judge him like he does me . he apologized for the hurtful things he's said to me over the years 

he kept talking with me like he was still interested and i had to make it clear that was not going to happen . i had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him i had to go ahead and block his number. i can't believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he's a total creep and a massive hypocrite.

always get a face pic, people.

tl:dr: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . should have insisted on the face pic

edit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but i'll answer some pressing questions . i did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who i was . it is pretty disturbing to say the least. as far as blackmail goes i have everything saved but i don't plan on doing anything with it as i think that could actually put me in danger . this man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.

"for getting upset that my sister's fiance pulled me aside and patted me down at their wedding?. the title sounds so stupid but here we go anyways.

i'm 24 and i'm an addict who has been in recovery for the past six months. 

i used and used until i was basically in poverty and my older sister helped bail me out more than once. 

she's my best friend and i know it hurt her a lot to see me like that. 

she also met her fiance two years ago and he really only knew me as the junkie brother then. he's not my biggest fan to say the least considering how much i put my sister through. 

despite this she still invited me to her wedding last week because i am her brother and she wanted me to be there. 

when i get to the reception, my brother in law is greeting people as they walk in. 

when i walk by he pulls me to the side and in front of everyone starts patting me down and says that he needs to check me to make sure i ""didn't bring anything in"".  i instinctively pull away, because why wouldn't i, and i tell him not to touch me. 

he tells me to ""calm down"" and that if i want to be here then he needs to do this. i tell him he's being ridiculous and i try to push past him. he stops me and tells me that he doesn't want to throw me out but he ""will if he has to."" i told him that he's trying to look tough but it's just making him look stupid. 

at this point i'm getting more and more angry and i'm practically yelling in his face at this point. bystanders came between us and separated us and told my bil to just ""drop it."" he said he would but that ""they can deal with it when i get out of hand.""

i just went to go find a seat after that. 

after the reception, a lot of my family told me that i should've let him just do it and that i was acting like a huge asshole and like i had ""something to hide."" 

i don't think he had any right to pat me down, especially in front of people and i don't think my reaction was over the top. if anything, he was the one acting like a huge douche by trying to start drama so he can look tough. my sister has refused to take any sides in this.

"i suspect my step-mom attempted to poison my dying dad's food. i managed to procure specimen in question. what do i do now?. not sure if this is the right subreddit. sorry for the wall of text, but my head is spinning and i don't know what to do. let me break down some background first:

&#x200b;

my dad is currently dying of liver failure. he's in end-stage, at-home hospice care.  we have nurses and social workers that visit every single day in the hospital bed we set up to help care and clean him up. the man is incontinent and can barely move unassisted. he's taking light doses of morphine and lorazepam so that he can sleep. the consensus seems to be that he'll be lucky to make to thanksgiving....

&#x200b;

my step-mom has a very shady history....she has three dead husbands  prior to my dad from whom she collects monthly in the sums of many thousands combined.  there was a fourth man after that she got engaged to after a mere 6 months, who died under mysterious circumstances, and she fought to take as many of his valuable possessions from under the noses of his children as she could. (my dad would be the 5th man)

she's euthanized 2 of her own dogs and 1 of her own cats....herself. not through any vet or other official. she is barred from every animal shelter and adoption agency in the state as a result.

so with that pre-established pattern in mind....let me bring you to last night.

&#x200b;

she brought in a ""home-made"" tuna fish sandwich to feed my dad, because he barely eats anymore, and it's somewhat of a thrill when he requests something. he was lucid and alert, laughing and joking. in a matter of less than a minute after devouring half the sandwich, he began to have the most extreme reaction i've ever seen him have:  his eyes rolled back, he began to seriously convulse, let out a series of loud groans and moans....his face contorted, and he was completely unresponsive to all outside stimuli - lights, loud voices, touch, you name it. before i even put two and two together, she's asking him (a little too enthusiastically) ""do you see the light yet??? do you see all the pretty angels??"" (wtf????). he's been in an essentially catatonic state since. out cold for the past 12 hours. it was a transformation that happened mid-sentence as he was speaking. in tears, i begged him to squeeze my hand if he could hear me, but....no dice. i was truly scared and genuinely thought i was going to lose him right then and there. we called hospice to send a nurse over (instead of calling 911, which is what we've been instructed to do. they are on staff 24/7). she wasn't sure what the catalyst for this episode was, but she did say that his vitals were okay and that this is a normal part of the dying process, and that if anything, we will be seeing things like this more often, and that it could also possibly be the drugs.

but he's been on them for weeks, at low, very controlled doses, and nothing like this has ever happened. i'm just a lay person, but that did not seem normal, and it's very suspicious to me that it happened immediately following the food, like flipping a light switch.

maybe i'm crazy. maybe i'm reading too much into it.  but i managed to wrap up the other half of the sandwhich in plastic wrap, and keep it refridgerated. my first thought is to get it analyzed in some lab somewhere....but....where? is that even a thing? do i take it to the police and tell them my suspicions? a hospital?

with him being in the dying stage already, is it even worth pursuing??

&#x200b;

again, if it weren't  for this woman's history, i probably wouldn't think anything of it....

&#x200b;

any and all feedback would be much appreciated. i'll do my best to answer any questions as well. ",2

"by trying to play my dad's didgeridoo.. so my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in australia 10+ years ago. my parents wanted to go out for a walk but i decided i'd eaten too much cheese and couldn't be arsed. while they were out the internet went down so i was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when i spotted the didg. i thought to myself in all these years i've never actually tried to play it (it's more of a decoration and i barely take it in when i see it) and maybe it's time. i pick it up and put it to my lips. i felt like i knew what i was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. i take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. i splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. at first i thought it was saliva and ignored it as i had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. it felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. i glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. the second i clock what's happened i feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. i have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. i run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. i urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. i don't think my mouth will ever feel normal again.

"alcohol is one of the worst drugs and shouldn't have the social acceptance it does.. alcohol is deceptively innocent especially to people that haven't done many drugs. it slows down reaction times, clouds judgment and pretty much makes you worse at everything. in high quantities it is easily the most intoxicating substance i've ever consumed and can effect cognitive functioning for up to 3 days. 

there is a huge focus on how alcohol effects driving but people don't seem to care about how it effects the rest of your their life  and we focus on driving because it requires  us to be on the ball 100% of the time and the consequences are deadly. 

i really don't have any data to support the rest, but my personal opinion is that getting drunk more than once a week will lower iq and job performance as well as performances on anything skill based ie.  video games, sports, music, driving, dancing etc.  over time you will become a shadow of the person you could have been if you weren't drinking and to clarify i don't mean a glass of wine at dinner or a single beer but anything more than a slight buzz regularly.

we talked with the teacher, who said she would ""keep an eye on things"" to try and eliminate the opportunity for it to occur.  this has not helped.  we escalated to the principal, who was kind but essentially said it was up to my daughter to cause a scene and yell and scream to bring attention to the issue whenever it happens to try and deter it, but my daughter does not want to do this because she finds the situation embarrassing and doesn't want the attention.  not to mention, it's not actually addressing the issue.

the principal said that they ""have a plan in place, but the plan will only work if all parties are on board.""  the read between the lines comment was: ""the boy's parents are not taking the issue seriously.""  the principal immediately knew who the boy was, and in talking with other parents at least one other girl in the class is having a similar issue of unwanted touching.

i don't want to cause any political debates. if it's necessary for context: obviously i believe that women should be allowed to vote. 

i'm so confused, i don't know what to think. i'm not even sure if this is the proper sub but i just feel that i need some advice.

in the time i have known him, my boyfriend has always fell politically independent, or so i thought. politics was never an issue between us at all. however he just admitted to me that over the past year he's grown more and more extreme in his views, to the point that he believes women have ruined the country (we are american) and that they should not be allowed to vote... he says he did not feel comfortable telling me about this sooner because he thought he would lose me.

i'm upset and i can't tell if i'm wrong to be upset about this because i know that everyone is entitled to have their own views, but now i just feel as though he doesn't even value my own input/views. he has assured me that he still thinks that i should be allowed to vote but that women in general should not...

this is a person i have been with for almost 5 years. we've talked about marriage. i don't know what to think. in all other aspects he is the perfect, most amazing partner, and i can't imagine my life without him in it. but this suddenly has me rethinking about a lot.

am i wrong to be questioning our relationship over his new beliefs? as his girlfriend am i supposed to be tolerant and respectful of his views even though i may (strongly) disagree? i can't tell if i'm overreacting to this or not. the whole situation has made me feel terrible and i'm so confused.",8
