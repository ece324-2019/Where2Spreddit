"things i wish i'd done in my 20's. i was thinking this morning about habits i developed a bit later than i should have, even when i knew i should have been doing them. these are a few things i thought i'd share and interested if others who are out of their 20s now have anything additional to add.

edit 1: this is not a everyone must follow this list, but rather one philosophy and how i look back on things.

edit 2: i had no idea this musing would blow up like this. i'm at work now but will do my best to respond to all the questions/comments i can later today. 


1. take full advantage of 401k match. when i first started my career i didn't always do this. i wasn't making a lot of money and prioritized fun over free money. honestly i could have had just as much fun and made some better financial choices elsewhere, like not leasing a car.
2. invest in a roth ira. once i did start putting money into a 401k i was often going past the match amount and not funding a roth instead. if i could go back that's what i'd do. i'm not in a place where i max out my 401k and my with and i both max out roth iras.
3. don't get new cars. i was originally going to say don't lease as that's what i did but a better rule is no new cars. one exception here is if you are fully funding your retirement and just make a boatload of money and choose to treat yourself in this way go for it. i still think it's better to get a 2 year old car than a new one even then but i'll try not to get too preachy.
4. buy cars you can afford with cash. i've decided that for me i now buy cars cash and don't finance them, but i understand why some people prefer to take out very low interest loans on cars. if you are going to take a loan make sure you have the full amount in cash and invest it at a higher rate of return, if it's just sitting in a bank account you are losing money. we've been conditioned for years that we all deserve shiny new things. we don't deserve them these are wants not needs.



those are my big ones. i was good with a lot of other stuff. i've never carried a balance on a credit card. i always paid my bills on time. i had an emergency fund saved up quite early in my career. the items above are where i look back and see easy room for improvement that now at 37 would have paid off quite well for me with little to no real impact on my lifestyle back then aside from driving around less fancy cars.",10
"always save your position's job posting and offer letter to negotiate a raise in the future!. always save a copy of your position's job posting and your employer's offer letter.   


this way, you can reference this when you go above and beyond your listed duties and point out to your employer why you deserve a raise. or, if the job posting of what became your position listed a ballpark salary estimate that's way below what you're currently making, use that as leverage, too.

"got a performance rating of exceeds expectations. my boss requested a significant salary adjustment and i was denied and given the standard 2.5%. should i quit my job?. i was originally promoted within my company to create a new department about 1.5 years ago. i've since worked my ass off and spent the last year doing managerial level work for non-managerial pay ($47k). 

i initially accepted this offer as it was in line with my experience at the time but i've now shown that my capabilities go far beyond what was originally expected of me. my market value is between $60-75k based on the title i *should* have. 

my boss agreed with this and requested a large pay bump prior to my review. he was denied and told i'd receive the standard 2.5% that everyone else got and could renegotiate in 6 months. 

the problem with this is that i was told the same thing the last time i requested a raise and it was never followed up. 

i've set up a meeting to ask what specific goals and milestones are in place for this 6 month period. 

are they saying to renegotiate in 6 months because raises were already budgeted for review time, or are they just trying to pay me as little as possible. 

worth noting that i love my job - i self manage with hardly any supervision as i chat with my boss every friday about what's going on. should i just leave now or wait until i discuss why my salary adjustment was denied with the ceo?

edit: i don't plan to quit without receiving an offer from another company - just asking if it's worth negotiating with my current employer or if i should just take more money somewhere else. 

edit 2: holy hell i only expected to get 5-10 responses. thanks everyone for the help!

current plan is to discuss why this happened and to also shop around for other jobs. probably won't use an offer as leverage although i've seen others here do so successfully. cheers, all. ",10
"wi my girlfriend's landlord just entered her house when he thought nobody was home.. my girlfriends landlord entered her house after he talked to her as she was going to work. he believed nobody to. be home, but i was here laying in bed. i woke up to him coming into the apartment to use the bathroom and then leaving. when i said something as he was leaving he ignored me. i text my girlfriend about it to see if she had given him permission to enter and she said no. he did have permission to enter the building at 11 am to show her apartment, but this was at 9:30 am and he had no tenant to sho the apartment to. he just came in, used the bathroom and left. he didn't even finish flushing the toilet. 

when i confronted him he became aggressive with me, made threatening gestures toward me and started trying to accuse me of wrongfully occupying the building, which is not the case. he then left the property and came back 20 minutes later and started banging on the door and threatening me and accusing me of wrongfully occupying the space again. and when i explained to him that i had every right to be there because i had permission from the tenant to be there, he said ""okay, i'll let you go this time."" 

my girlfriend feels uncomfortable here because he just entered the unit without her permission. how can we make sure he doesn't do this again? 

also, the dude didn't even finish flushing the toilet and left a turd in it.

"i stole and used my college roommate's fleshlight, then threw it out. it wasn't a real fleshlight, just a knockoff that looked like a mouth wearing bright red lipstick. he said he bought it as a joke and wasn't actually going to use it. one night we went out to a party - at the end of the night my roommate left with a girl and i went home alone. i was pretty drunk and horny, remembered his knockoff fleshlight, and thought borrowing it would be a great idea. i could use it then clean and return it and he'd have no idea. i grabbed it, lubed it up and went to town. it actually felt quite nice. shortly after finishing, but before i had a chance to clean things up, i hear the front door opening... roommate had come home early. i panicked and needed to get rid of the evidence as soon as possible, so i opened the window and threw the sex toy out. it landed in the center of our dorm's quad (grassy area where students sit, play frisbee, etc), and that was that.

the next day i went outside to look for it, but it was already gone. roommate asked me if i'd seen it a few days later but i just played dumb. don't think he ever found out what happened because i've never told anyone.",11

"for asking for pocket money because ""i am a kid too"". i am 19f, have a little brother who is 8, and living with my parents at the moment. i am still studying so i cannot pay rent yet, but i do earn my own pocket money from part-time jobs.


my father's 3 brothers and their family came to our town for a vacation for 3 days over the weekend. they have not met for years so it's their big gathering and they had been planning for a long time. that plan seemed to have the members split into 2 groups - the adults and the kids. i had been arranged to join the kids' group, when i tried to protest they insist that i am a ""kid"" too, so i just had to submit to my fate. clearly they all just wanted a babysitter for their 5 kids(age 5-10) while they ""adults"" get out and enjoy their reunion.


so i spent the weekend babysitting a total of 5 kids. that includes organizing games at home to entertain them, bring them to science park and the likes for outings and food and just overall watch over their safety and be an ""adult"" when needed. to be honest it was quite fun, though tiring when i sometimes had to raise my voice to make myself heard and drag the younger ones back when they stray too far(i admit, i am not really babysitter material). the kids seem to like me, so i guess it went well too. however, i still would rather be either hanging out with other adults or just having my weekend to my own. 


when my 3 uncles' families' were leaving after the weekend, they gave pocket money to each of the kids, including my brother, my father also gave pocket money to each of my cousins. almost as expected, there wasn't a share for me. now, i don't really care about the pocket money, they are just a couple of notes i can easily earn in a few hours, but i am rather annoyed for the fact that conveniently, i was skipped for being an ""adult"" this time.


i put on the biggest smile i and asked politely for pocket money from my uncles and aunt-in laws. they were a little taken aback. i said as sweetly as i could that i deserve pocket money too for being a ""kid"", they said so themselves. in all awkwardness i got my pocket money. needless to say, my parents looked like they had shit smeared across their faces.


i got the biggest shit from my parents after they left. in their words, i am a major ah to have deliberately made my parents lose face, and so on and so forth. aita?",3
"you should be able to honestly tell your so if they have gained weight to the point of you losing physical attraction towards them and you shouldn't be labelled as a ""bad person / a*hole/ etc"" if you do so.. **tldr** : you should be able to straightforwardly and respectfully express to your so if they gained weight to the point you start losing desire for their body if you both consider sex  and physical attraction vital for your relationship.

**edit - before anything else please read:** 

\- so, let me start by saying i deleted most of my text as those lines don't really serve purpose. they were indeed too long to even consider reading through. 

\- the other thing is: i have to admit that this post was rushed. and yes, i am quite inconsiderate in it (for reference see my content below and some of my replies). the funny thing is that while i might think some commenters are oversensitive i have the other end of the spectrum: insensitiveness to some extent and i can also get oversensitive. i don't regret what i wrote (it was a start for a good lesson) but reading through some well thought-out opinions my self-reflection started to operate. some of you made the assumption that i must not have a lot of experience regarding relationships. that's right. and sometimes i turn into this arrogant person who likes to believe she knows it all (btw i'm female for those who thought otherwise). the reactions are just as harsh as my statement but it's okay. i can understand that what i said can be an effective method in some relationships  (that's great) and cannot be applied in others (which is also valid). and at the end i'm the one who should have stayed more flexible. i should have considered more factors. i want to apologize about that honestly. so thank you all for responding and expressing your viewpoints, now i'll have a lot to think about and a lot to work on. i'm not afraid to face judgement if that's what people feel like giving me based on my content. so thank you for offering the experience. i appreciate both the agreements and disagreements. i'll try and digest them properly in the following days. i'm still think that i'm right about some aspects but not anymore do i believe my reasoning is flawless. i wanted everyone who engaged in  this conversation to know that.

**content:**

honesty is not kindness. honesty is honesty. period. i don't mean you have to be cruel about it but you shouldn't put honesty aside in favor of toning serious things down. you can be honest and respectful and showing care without being overly soft towards your partner. if you can't take it well, the problem is you and not the other person. and yes, it is applicable to those who have mental health issues, too.

you can't just tiptoe around a topic that is basically one of the most essential founding-factors of a (sexual) relationship.

your partner should be able to freely speak his/her mind (again respectfully and kindly enough which is still not too ""soft"") - and how you react to that is your responsibility. the partner doesn't have to just accept the fact you gained weight just because it's a sensitive topic to you. i wonder why it's so sensitive…

looks does matter. we have a right to voice what we like and by putting away our own ego we should be more flexible dealing with and communicating it.",6
"for telling my friend to find her own hobbies and interests instead of just copying whatever her current boyfriend is into?. title says it all. my friend is one of those girls who always has a boyfriend, and that boyfriend becomes a central part of her identity. last night we were having dinner and she said she needed a new hobby because she didn't realize gaming could be so expensive. she dropped $2500 on a gaming rig because the guy she is dating now is into gaming, when before this she didn't even have candy crush on her phone.

so i told her that she should find her own hobbies and interests instead of getting into whatever her current boyfriend is into. i reminded her that she enrolled in bjj class when she dated a bjj blackbelt (but she never stepped into a gym again after they broke up), she bought tons of baking tools and supplies when she dated a pastry chef (all banished to some faraway corner of her kitchen cabinet as i write this), she even wanted to buy a cobra when she was seeing a guy who collected them (thank god the guy told her that she absolutely shouldn't do it).

after dinner one of our other friends told me i shouldn't have said that to her and she clearly looked hurt, but i think that there was nothing wrong with what i said because i just pointed out facts and i think she needed to hear that to realize how dependent her personality is on her boyfriends and how ridiculous she is acting by copying their interests.

"for exposing the real reason my sister and her bf broke up.. throwaway, and i will be keeping this is anonymous as i can, every name will be fake. 

my sister (cas) 25f and her boyfriend (jon) of 3 years 24m broke up last week, i'm good friends with jon and we chat in a discord server often. i assumed it was a mutual breakup and so asked jon if he was doing ok, he then asked me if i knew the reason they broke up. i said no and he explained that it was because he was bisexual, he even showed me screenshots where it showed how homophobic my sister is, i was shocked and apologized to him. 

the next day i was scrolling through facebook and noticed my sister had made a post about the breakup, turns out she is claiming that he cheated on her. she must of blocked him so he could not show the actual truth. 

with jon's permission i posted all the screenshots on my facebook page. 
 it caused my parents to call me and tell me i have to take the post down as my sister has had over 30 people unfriend her, i've also had messages from my sister that where not so nice. my mum has told me that i'm now ruining my sisters life.

"update: i think my (22m) girlfriend (20f) might be cheating on me with my roommate.. original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/aj79wj/i\_think\_my\_22m\_girlfriend\_20f\_might\_be\_cheating/(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/aj79wj/i_think_my_22m_girlfriend_20f_might_be_cheating/)

tldr: my girlfriend was really close with my roommate, i suspected cheating, was confirmed at a party when she made a scene about her friend kissing said roommate.

basically, after i kicked my gf out of our party, i assumed we would all lay low for a few days. i was wrong. the day after the party, my roommate (i decided to call him chet) knocked on my door and tried to talk, but i ignored him. less than an hour later the (ex) girlfriend sends me a long text, at first apologizing, then explaining that her screwing chet couldn't have been avoided, because while i was a good boyfriend, i study and sleep too much. ok. she then told me she would be willing to work through this if i was willing to try to be better and pay more attention to her. i didn't respond to the text.

that night i had a dinner with my parents i couldn't miss, that the ex knew about. i came home to find all of her stuff taken out of my room. i figured ok, she got the hint and moved her stuff back to her dorm. wrong. i noticed later when chet's door was open she had actually moved her stuff into his room.

i haven't seen either of them, i think they've been out of the apartment to avoid me. i don't even know how to feel. honestly the breakup is so raw (even though we haven't even really had the chance to break up) and i'm so angry at both of them, but strangely miss them at the same time. ",7
"i'm a 20f college student who just got guardianship of my 12 year old sibling. help!. long story short: my mother is a raging alcoholic and after cps and law enforcement being involved (and the father being out of the picture), i'm now the guardian of my younger sister.

i have no idea what to do.

i work full-time in a food service job making $10 per hour not including tips, which brings it to around $11-$14 per hour depending on the day.

i bring home between $1,700 and $2,000 per month. (depending on tips)

i just signed a lease for a 2br apartment at $900 per month. it is literally the cheapest option i could find that was in a safe area and not too far of a commute to work (around 11 miles).

my current expenses are: $160 for a personal loan, $40 for cell phone, $180 for car insurance, $80 credit card. per month. 

i honestly don't know what to do. her child support is coming to me now, so that gives me an extra $400 per month.

she doesn't have health insurance and hasn't been in school for almost a year now. since i am her guardian can i add him to my own health insurance as a dependent?

i figured posting here would be most helpful because as a college student i have no idea how to budget for a child. tuition isn't an issue because it's fully covered by grants.

how do i plan this? what are my options? i don't even know where to start...

"i found ~$5k in savings making totally non-life altering changes. i've been wanting to write this for a while. a while back i hated my job. i was working 80 hour weeks and getting paid doo-doo for the effort. in response i wrote up an ""escape plan"". it included a bunch of ways for me to replace my income, but it also included a ton of ways to save money without changing the quality of my life. 

i spent hours and hours making this thing, so that i'd have a plan to follow. good news, i got out of that hell hole, more good news, the money-saving piece is relevant to almost everyone so i figured i'd share all the ways i found that can help you save a crap ton of money without really having to change your life. 

so without further adieu. 
     

* **change your car insurance:** car insurance companies make most of their money on old clients. once you get past a certain age, they creep your rates up ever so slowly. they are willing to discount your insurance when you switch.

so we shopped around, found the lowest quote and saved a crap ton on the discount they were giving us. this was an easy one-time change that affects my life 0. 

**before:** $196/month 
**after:** $116/month
**annual savings:** $960

     
      
* **threaten your internet provider:** every internet provider offers promotional rates for your first year, then hike your bill after your first year. i've never had a problem giving someone a call and telling them that i want to move to another service because they are offering a promotion. every time they offer me their promotional rate. this is a once a year phone call that saves you a decent chunk of change. 

**before:**$69.00(lol)
**after:** $45.00
**annual savings:** $288

this won't work if there is only one provider servicing your area. sorry comcast slaves. 

     

* **switch your phone plan to mint mobile, or red pocket.** these are services that piggyback off of major mobile phone network providers at stupid discounts. 2 lines on mint is something like $15 a month. it's stupid how cheap these lines can be. their service is quite good as well.

**before:** $180/month 
**after:** $30/month
**total annual savings:** $1800
     

* **use a few credit cards like a debit card:**. if you're in the middle of crawling out of cc debt this is particularly bad advice. but if you are basically debt free, and can responsibly use your credit card like a debit card; paying it off as you go, you can save a bunch of money. basically, every expense besides my mortgage goes through a credit card so i can reap those sweet sweet rewards. 

between 3 cards i get rewards that include:

5% on gas

3% on dining out

2% on grocery stores and costco

1.5% on everything else. 

essentially these are discounts on everything. 

**before:** $0
**after:** +$30/month
**annual savings:** $720
  

these savings are based on expenses between my fiance and me.
     

* **oil change coupons:** i refuse to be a coupon lady. partly because of my y chromosome, but also because the time it takes to effectively coupon is not worth it to me. i'd rather do anything else. but oil change coupons are very easy. you have to get your oil changed at least once a quarter, and googling a coupon for it works 100% of the time. you should never pay full price for an oil change. 
  
i'm sure some of you are also saying *but foofy, you could save more by changing your own oil*. to that i say *sure, but i don't want to change anything in my life and the hourly savings is like $5. printing a coupon is easier*

**before:** $70/quarter
**after**: $50/quarter
**annual savings:** $80

not a lot, but seriously this one is so easy. 

     
* **buy a smart thermostat:** i wasted a ton of money by heating an entire house for the sake of my pets. they are going to sleep in a sunbeam no matter the temperature so there's lots of savings to be had here. you could just remember to turn down the heat/air everytime you leave the house, but that would require me to change way too much about my habbits. instead, a smart thermostat. hard to give you the ""before"" on this one but here we go:


**before:** ??
**monthly savings:** $13.5/month
**annual savings:** $135

      
* **utilize an hsa**. for those that don't know an hsa is a ""health spending account"". the way it works is you put money into it directly from your bank account, and all of that money is tax free. it's basically a free 25% money back on health expenses depending on your tax bracket. i grow moles like it's my job, and in order to avoid dying of skin cancer i have to get them removed constantly, this tacks up my health bill may be a little higher than most but still, here's the savings i had, yours will likely be more or less: 

i can hear it now, ""but my employer doesn't offer an hsa"", you can actually contribute to an hsa without your employer(https://20somethingfinance.com/contribute-to-hsa-outside-of-employer-payroll-deduction/)


**before:** $2000
**after:** $1500
**annual savings:** $500

here's an hsa savings calculator(https://www.wageworks.com/employees/support-center/hsa-savings-calculator/) if you want to figure out what you can/should contribute.

        

* **cancel your unusedgym membership:** if you don't have one, well then you can't do this one. if you have one and you consistently use it, well then don't cancel it. that said, gyms expect only 18% of people to consistently use thier facilities(https://www.creditdonkey.com/gym-membership-statistics.html) so there's a good chance that many of you (like myself) can cancel their membership without affecting their life. the 3x a year you convince yourself you're going to get in shape you can just go run outside instead. 

**before:** $20
**after:** $0
**annual savings:** $240

        
alright, that's all the easy stuff you can do without changing your life. **the grand total for us came out to $4,723.** just shy of the $5k i promised. to be fair i did put a ""~"" in front of it. 

       
not everyone one of these is going to be applicable to every person but i hope you were able to find a few nuggets in here that could save you some money. 





edit: someone noted my wonky math that cc rewards didn't add up. i forgot to double the amount with my fiance which doesn't perfectly work but is not far off. keep in mind that $1500 in expenses each going through only our 1.5% cc would yield $22.5 each. not including all the optimizing we can do. she has 3% on online shopping too so $60/month between the two of us in rewards is not that far out of the realm of possibility.

last night was doing laundry at the local laundromat.  i had 3 washers going at once. now normally, you fill the wash, add detergent, add quarters and select the cycle. when i pressed the cycle button normally the previously selected cycle button pops out kinda like a switch. i didn't notice it but it happened with this washer. so the washer had 2 cycle buttons pressed. about half hour goes by and washer 1&2  are done but washer 3 is still on the first part of the cycle. now it being 9pm and with the placing closing at 10 i decide to take the unfinished soaking wet clothes and put them in the dryer. about 2 minutes into the dryer the laundry attendant said i broke the dryer bc of the wet clothes. she took my wet clothes and put it in machine that just spins the clothes dry and then put them back in the dryer. she asked for my name and phone number so i wrote down ""trevor lahey"" and some random collection of 10 digits. those of you who watch trailer park boys will understand. so as the the last dryer is finishing the owner comes in ask me what happened. he couldn't believe that washer 3 didn't spin dry my clothes and was stuck in the same cycle for 1.5 hours until i had to physically show him how all the other washers work the same except for washer 3. he still even tried to spin it on me for breaking the dryer bc i didn't tell the attendant about the washer. so anyway he grabbed the piece of paper with my fake name and number and said that he'll give me a call tomorrow (today) to see how much the dryer is gonna cost to be fixed or replaced. lol fuck off",11
"for telling a friend's friend that he couldn't keep the ""jackpot"" that he hit on my antique slot machine? (about $700). i had a party at my house last night. i have an antique slot machine from the 1940s that is in absolutely spotless and working condition in my living room. my step grandma was a show girl she she got it while dating a count room guy prior to meeting my grandpa.

over the years people have played it and maybe won a few quarters here and there. maybe a max of $50 at a time. as far as i know the jackpot was never hit on it so however it works there was probably about $700 in the jackpot reserve that had built up over the years. i'd never bothered to have it cleaned out since it just seemed like a fun novelty. 

well a friend's friend hit the jackpot last night. i was fucking floored when he legit thought he could keep my ~$700. his case was hed been playing with his own money and i would have kept his quarters. my argument  was i'd be happy to give him his quarters back if he'd asked but i'm not a casino and while i'm not destitute, i can't afford to give someone $700. argument caused the party to wind down and one of my best guy friends basically told the guy he'd be in real shit if he tried to leave with the money but the guy left threatening to come back with the cops and sue me in small claims court. i have no idea if that was realistic but no cops came back. 

so was i the asshole for nor letting him keep the money?

edit: sorry guys i can't answer such witticisms as ""why are you so shity?"" because i've been banned.

edit2: wow since i'm a ""baby gangster"" who has been running an ""illegal gaming operation"" (both things that have been said) i might as well just go whole hog and start running guns and pimping underage andean alpacas to people who would pay for the privilege. i'm really that bad? i just thought i had a cool thing my step grandma got by banging a dude from the count room.

edit3: gotta address this one directly:

>if this was really last night, give it a week or a month and see how many friends, especially mutual friends, are no longer talking to you. forget our votes, listen to those. also forget small claims, you need to worry more about hearing from your state's gambling commission.

if the moderators allow me to update, i will absolutely update and tell you how many friends i've lost. almost everyone  (including the friend that brought the ""winner"" thought he was being a total asshole for the way he was down on his hands and knees scooping up quarters off the floor to put in his pockets. and he was lying about much he put into the machine too (he said $75–who the fuck walks around, nuch less even get $75 in quarters—when going to a party at a strangers house). in addition, i will gladly, gladly call our state gaming commission (az) and ask what trouble i might be in. i will also update on that when i can. people can't be this dramatic in real life...i'm a ducking instagram influencer for my job, the phoniest, most vapid, saddest job a person can have right now and i'm still blown away by some of these comments. call me yta all you like, but don't be stupid and claim to have knowledge you don't  in the process.

edit4: well i was banned for joking around, other people have bad posts calling me a cunt up for over an hour.  makes info hard but i'll try to explain my thinking on the money in the machine and why i can't ""afford"" to give it to him. 

say you have a change jar, has $100 in it. your good friend asks to borrow $25, for parking, you'd say yes right? another friend says wow, that's cool i have $1.25 in my pocket, can i donate to your change jar? you'd say yes. now let's say a guy you've never met says ""hey i just put .80 into your change jar, now i'm taking the whole thing."" you would say no. it's how i've always seen the slot machine as huge change jar for all my close friends to use. i've given people quarters to play, i've taken a quarter here and there from people who wanted to see it work. i've taken in maybe $100 over five years. maybe. that's a nickel a day. that's not a freaking illegal gambling operation.


edit5: a good question:

>info did he explicitly ask if he was allowed to play it, and keep what he wins? if no then he played it without permission, you aren't running a casino.

no he did not, the first time i ever saw or spoke to him was when he was on his hands and knees picking quarters up off the floor slamming them his pockets.  i don't mind if people play it, i even give people quarters to play it (since no one has change anymore) but he did not ask.

edit6: another good question

>also, need more info. you stated that other guests have won small jackpots in the past (max $50). did you let them keep it? if so, why are you making a double-standard here?


i would have let him keep $50-100 (he certainly got away with some in his pockets) but he was such an asshole right away that he didn't give me the chance to come to any sort of deal. most everyone at the party just wanted him gone. i do feel bad and maybe my guilt over the apparent double standard is why i'm asking here. but i do feel as though had he been even slightly cool and not threaten cops or lawsuits i wouldn't have been backed into a corner.

edit7: 

>info
we need to know where the money came from. did the money in the machine come from you putting it in or playing the machine

so this is all guess work based on what my grandma said the jackpot could hold (there's a window that shows the coins in rhe jackpot, the space behind is about the size of a big shoe box). she said it gets full at $800. it was more than half when she and my grandpa gave it to me, i always guessed $500. in five years it's now 7/8ths full. i play it from to time to time so i'd say $100 of that is mine and $100 is friends. i think the jackpot and normal pay outs come from different boxes so last night was the last night i've ever seen that window empty. i know nothing of the machine or how it works or how to change settings so i may be so wrong and a slot machine ""nerd"" could correct me if i'm way off base.

edit8: this is the best yta take so far and i can't let it get buried.

> i really hope you get into some serious legal trouble and then you'll wish all you lost was several hundred and not thousands including jail time.

edit9 (at 5:45am, gotta work): you guys are really cracking me up. i love the comments that say ""your edits make you yta! alone. where did the money come from btw?""  i truly can accept the yta votes but so freaking many of them have basic facts wrong.

1. i wasn't profiting off this machine. i've literally never opened it up and taken a single coin out.

2. i can't afford to give a random dude $700. i don't need it now, but i have savings account i don't need it now either but i might some day. and now i've found out that some of the quarters that my grandma had from the 50s or 60s might actually be silver. so good thing i hung onto them right ? (i can't wait for the ""you're a stupid thot"" rationalizations to come from this one). 

3. i never cleaned it out because honestly i like the way it looked with the coins in the window. this thing is enourmous and built with casino security in mind so it was in fact, a great piggy bank. 

4. some nice ntas have suggested i have a bowl of quarters a for people to play. i actually in effect did that because 80% the time people who wanted to play didn't have change (i got it five years ago) so i always had quarters around, maybe just not right by the machine. 

5. as an example, over the years it's mostly friends kids who want to play. i had a very precocious 9 year old once come over with his $20 of money truly expecting to get the jackpot. he was heartbroken when he didn't win (i might have given it to him since he was so cute) but i gave him a $20 silver certificate my step grandma had given me (acquired ny dubious means no doubt) and that kid was thrilled. so i always, always give people money back if they ask. i never intended to profit off the machine. no one has ever made a big deal of it before (save the 9 year old).

edit10: this dude wins the comments, for all time:

>i bet u look like jared fogle or some shit

😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂


edit 11: sooooo the plot thickens, thank you to some very helpful people who own slot machines who dm'ed who were also able to suggest experts in my area, i was able to call a local person who works on antique slot machines. my slot machine is highly customized but it's based around a pretty well known model from that era (don't want to say exactly because only a few of them exist anymore) and he said i could tell right away if the machine was broken or had been tampered with. in my very, very, very amateur job of checking it over it does appear that this little piece is either broken or misplaced. so it looks like this piece of shit ""guest"" actually broke my machine to steal my money. there wasn't a jackpot at all. i don't have confirmation of this until the repair guy is able to come later this week but it looks like that's what happened. the guy said there's an outside chance that if that piece was broken or tampered with that it was an accident but he wouldn't bet on it.  i still don't care if i'm yta till the cows come home, posting here has probably allowed me to get to the bottom of this. and fuck that guy.


edit 12: well the amazing and level headed moderators of this sub just ever so politely informed me that i will not be allowed to update this post. so the short story is the ""winner"" almost certainly was hitting the machine and caused the jackpot to spill out. so had i been a real casino i would have enacted the ""malfunction voids all pays and plays"" clause. so yeah, i was totally in the right. fuck this sub. fuck the moderators. and fuck those of you on your stupid high horse. most of you however were cool.",3
"in the tv series ""chernobyl"" how realisticaly depicted are the effects of intense radiation exposure?. after the explosion they depict an enormous light projecting from, presumably, the exposed nuclear core, it's depicted like a huge cone of light going up in the sky till the eye can see, would an exposed nuclear core in meltdown emit such a huge amount of light?

also a man is depicted looking directly into the exposed nuclear core, i presume in full meltdown, right after the explosion, immediately his face turns orange reddish and after a couple of seconds he's seriously sick and vomiting blood, is this accurate?

in general this is how it is depicted all the time, as soon as people get in contact with very high dosages of radiation their skin immediately starts to look red/orange and after a while it bleeds.

a firefighter that is in the middle of the rubble of the building is depicted picking up a piece of what presumably is a central part of the core, a piece of graphite, after seconds the hands from his skin looks burned, is this what would happen in such circumstances? would it be that quick?

the nuclear core in full meltdown is depicted as a glowing mass on fire, is that accurate? how would it actually look? what would be the temperature of it?",9

"my (21f) bf (20) told me he would break up with me if i got breast augmentation surgery. so i have, what is known as, ""tuberous breasts"" where during puberty the breast tissue doesn't develop like it should. the breasts develop droopy & the areolas are large & not proportional to the size of my breast. my plastic surgeon has confirmed this is what it is & told me that if i wanted to correct it, surgery is the only option. the surgery would include releasing the constricted tissue & then an implant will be placed above the muscle.

i am extremely insecure of my breasts, always have been. because i know they don't look normal. i just want to be confident with my body & feel sexy when i take my shirt off.

i mentioned this procedure to my boyfriend & he immediately shot it down. he says he doesn't want a girl with ""fake boobs"". he won't even listen to me when i tell him how gross my breasts make me feel.

i 100% plan on going through with the surgery. i told my doctor up front that i did not want large breasts, just full breasts & he told me that was absolutely achievable. boyfriend still does not agree. my appointment is in april, the day before mine & my bf's anniversary & 3 days after my 22nd birthday.

please tell me if i'm doing the right thing. is there any way to explain to him how this makes me feel? any advice is appreciated.


tl;dr: i have tuberous breasts & the only way to correct it is surgery. my bf completely shot down the idea bc he doesn't want to date a girl with fake boobs.",7

"tenant is renting out my apartment on airbnb. tenant isn't responding, airbnb doesn't care, and my condo board is threatening to fine me for each violation. i have no idea how to even handle this.. location: toronto, ontario

i own an apartment in downtown toronto, our building has had a bad history of problems with airbnb tenants so we voted to ban any sort of short term rental. currently i am on the other side of the continent for work, and won't be back until january.

i decided to list my place up for a rental in late august, for rental until janaury. since the rental time was almost half a year it doesn't count as a short term rental (several people do this in our building and it is fine). i immediately got a hit by a person named jane who was a student about to start grad school (i don't know if this is true or not), and we talked and decided to agree to the rental.she signed a document indicating she agreed to the buildings rules, including the notice about ""no short term rentals, through services such as airbnb"".

yesterday i got an email from our property manager:

* on monday they were testing each units smoke detectors, and he noticed there were 3 people in the unit. along with a strong smell of pot. they apparently identified themselves as airbnb renters. (apparently they tried to deny our property manager from entering, since they weren't sure of who he was since they were only renting this place for a week through airbnb).
* i am violating the rule about no short term rentals.
* i am apparently in violation of a bunch of rule violations such as the fact that more people are staying in my unit than permitted.
* apparently multiple guests have been parking overnight in the visitors spot (not allowed) who all recorded my unit number as the one they are visiting.

after getting that email i called him and confirmed, and i was able to find my place listed on airbnb, using very recent photos of my apartment. i tried to contact jane, through email (no response), phone calls go to voice mail, and facebook (she blocked me after i sent her a message).

i have tried numerous times to talk to airbnb, but all they have told me is they can't do anything about this, and basically refused to do anything about the listing.

aside from all the issues above, frankly i don't feel comfortable with a bunch of random strangers in my apartment at all. unfortunately i have no idea even what to do about this legally speaking. do i have any way to block these random people from entering my unit?

\*edit\* i forgot to add, that i have talked to a lawyer about evicting the tenant however he told me it could take upto 2+ months, which is why it won't really help. since by then in \~2 months her lease will be over. i want to stop randoms from airbnb from entering my apartment now. ",2
"for dressing nicer than the couple getting married?. a few months ago, my brother and now sil announced their intention to marry. the invitation to the wedding stated ""no dress code. wear whatever is comfortable for you."" in hindsight, i think they put that there since the event was at a lake. i didn't think much of the disclaimer at the time because it's a wedding, i should dress respectably for such an occasion, and i have a healthy selection of formal wear in my wardrobe. i chose a beautiful blue 3 piece suit.

yesterday was the wedding. when i showed up, i noticed everyone was dressed way more casually than i was. i'm talking polos, many people wearing shorts, only a few people wearing slacks and button down. i did feel a little out of place. my brother was wearing a suit with no tie, and my sil was wearing a modest white dress. the only comment i got on my attire during the event was a joke from my dad saying i looked like i'm marrying the sil, but that was it.

a few hours ago, i got a call from sil. holy shit, she is pissed at me! she was asking why i dressed like a pimp, i upstaged her and my brother, and i stuck out like a sore thumb on the photos. i referenced the invite, and how she said there was literally no dress code, and i was dressing respectfully. she was going on about how that implicitly meant not formal. i told her that she should've specified ""not formal"" to leave less interpretation freedom. she asked if i was that retarded. i told her that just because she's family doesn't give her the right to blame a miscommunication on me and call me a retard. i hung up. she spammed my phone with calls, so i blocked her and texted my brother i'll talk to her when she's ready to be less verbally abusive.

was i in the wrong?

edit: clarified she said i stuck out on the photos.

edit 2: my brother said i'm welcome to come over for dinner later. i unblocked her number. no call spam, so that's a good sign.

edit 3: had dinner with my brother and sil earlier. she showed me the pictures, and i can kind of see what she was talking about. i told her i'm sorry for being unaware, and that being unaware was still shitty of me because i did notice i was out of place and i should have tried to do something. she said she was sorry for yelling at me earlier, she's still annoyed about it, but said it would be silly to keep this over my head. so yeah, i don't think we're gonna be on jerry springer as far as i can tell.",3

"for catfishing my underaged sister on tinder and humiliating her in order to teach her a lesson?. last week, i was using my sister ashley's phone because mine was dead and i needed to call a friend to confirm plans. dialing my friend's number, i saw a tinder notification of some dude messaging her. immediately, i asked why she's on tinder (she's 17) and she grabbed her phone back and said ""none of your business"" 

i decided that i wanted to have a little fun with this. i wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt (maybe she's just swiping for fun?) so i didn't want to go straight to ratting her to our parents. to test if she was just using for fun, i decided i was going to make a tinder profile (of someone else) and message her and see if she responds. i asked a good friend from back in college (who happens to be a male model) kevin if he'd mind if i used his pictures and explained the situation. he thought it would be hilarious and told me to go for it. 

i created the account, set my age to 22, set my swipe radius to a mile, and quickly found my sister's account. her age was set to 19 (lie, she's still in **high school**) so i was definitely more suspicious of her now. i superliked and less than an hour later, she matched and messaged me. 

i decided to set up a date to a fancy restaurant downtown for sunday afternoon and told her we could ""head to my place afterwards"". she was completely receptive and said she'd meet me there. she told our parents she was hanging out with one of her track friends and spending the night at her place. 

after she left, i told our parents everything and showed them all of the messages. they were pissed, and i suggested we all go to the restaurant. my dad and i just went instead and saw her sitting at a table alone all dolled up waiting for ""jim"". my dad went up to her and said ""jim's not coming"" and she screamed and asked what we were doing there. i told her that there was no jim and that it was fucking stupid of her to be trying to meet grown men on tinder at her age. my dad harped on to that and lectured her on lying and meeting strange men on the internet, and being so willing to go back to a *stranger's* place. we were a bit loud so people were starting to look at us and my sister eventually bursted into tears and ran out. 

i told my friends in a groupchat the situation and they all agreed it was hysterical, except 2 of my female friends who said i was a ""fucking dick"" and ""cruel"" to her. my other friends defended me and said she needed to be taught a lesson. wondering who's right and if i went too far?

edit: yes, when i asked if she wants to go to my place afterwards, it was heavily implied that she would've had sex with jim. that's why i went the extent that i did.

alright after reading all these judgments, i came to the conclusion that i'm ta. but i'm ta she needed. if anything, she knows not to be a complete moron when finding people to hook-up with on tinder.

"by joking about ancestrydna and 23andme.. this actually happened over christmas last year.

my family, including (paternal) my grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having christmas dinner. 

my grandfather brought up that he did ancestrydna (or was it 23and me?). i don't remember the exact one, because i can barely think about it. it's hard just writing this up.

it was really cool to hear what he found. he found mostly scandinavian spread out over the british isles, particularly wales. we knew this part already, but then it was discovered he's 3% persian! very small, and probably doesn't mean much really, but cool nonetheless. he's a huge genealogy guy, so he's been working on his lineage. 

the only ancestor he's mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we're a direct but illegitimate descendant of king george iii. the reason why i question this is king george iii is recorded as one of the few kings who never had a mistress. 

however, he believes it because there's a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of king george iii (we are descended from the woman). he mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.

anyway, off topic. i thought it was fascinating, and i love hearing what he's found. i brought up possibly using my christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. i don't think i was really going to do it, i usually use the money to pay bills.

silence. and it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.

my sister and i look at each other quietly, wondering who's the half sibling. my parents haven't said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. we look like our parents, the only thing that's different is my eyes. i have weird hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. my sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. 

i always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. i never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it's not fair i have such cool pretty eyes. 

well, okay.

dad starts first. dad (d), mom (m), sister (s), and me.

d: there's a chance 3ar3ara_g0rd0n, that you're not my daughter.

s and me: imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. my sister grabs my hand (i love her big sister ways).

me: okay, um... 

d: your mom never had an affair. this isn't some cheating story.

me: wha.. (i start to feel very sick).

m: i hoped to never have to tell you this. i was raped. the reason we're not sure is because your dad and i had sex earlier that day.

me: (i want to die, i start crying). everyone else knows though, if they left the table.

d: your grandparents know.

s: okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?

m: no, they wouldn't move forward with the case. 

me: he's still out there?

s: but obviously we're far away from this guy, right?

my dad and mom look at each other. 

m: it was my brother.

i felt so sick. i felt... dirty. i had to run to the bathroom to throw up. i couldn't stop shaking. my sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. we probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren't thinking.

our husbands were just stunned and quiet.

the rest of the vacation was just weird. if it weren't for my nephews, i'm pretty sure i would have just gone home.

oh my nephews are wonderful.

well, we came home, and i had to battle with the ""do i want to know?"" thoughts. i could get a dna test. but i couldn't do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. but it weighed on me too much. i had to know in order to move forward. so i asked my dad if he would submit his dna with mine. we weren't going to tell my mother if it wasn't the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. it was hard asking him to not say anything to her. he should be able to talk to his wife.

so we submitted the test. 

i am my father's daughter. i cried when i got the results. it was a huge weight off my shoulders.

i made a decision not to tell my dad - i wanted to surprise them. i kept saying i hadn't gotten the results back. i did tell my sister though.

i gave them the piece of paper on mother's day. i was going to wait until father's day, but i couldn't. so i got a blank card. 

inside i wrote: ""mom, open the paper."" she opened it and i had written happy mother's day, and happy early father's day. 

lots of hugs and tears that day, yah? 

thank god.

edit: left out half a sentence, oops. 

it was my uncle on my mother's side. i have met him. my sister and i were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. 

family did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. 

my parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn't go through with it. two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there i guess was his reason. plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn't believe her. 

my mom didn't go no contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel's back. why that long, i have no idea. those are her reasons. 

she did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. i guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.

grandmother is dead now.

"by announcing to my daughter that i only shave my vag when her dad is due home. this literally just happened about an hour ago and had me and my husband alternating between cringing in embarrassed, and giggling like a couple of immature schoolchildren.

for context, my husband works away at sea for weeks at a time; he is due to leave later today, so is busy getting organised and packed up ready to go. 

he realised that he had ran out of razor blades, so being the loving wife that i am, i offered him one of my unused razor blades to tide him over until he can buy more on the mainland.
he commented that he didn't want to leave me short, and i assured him that that wouldn't be the case as i use an epilator on my legs and underarms, and only shave my foo-foo when he's due home. cue my daughter walking into the kitchen at that exact moment and awkwardly making eyecontact with me before walking back out the way she had come.

but since last year i have started an excel spreadsheet documenting what my bills are each month, how many thousands of gallons of water i'm using, kwh used, the whole shebang, in an attempt to be a more financially responsible and understand where my money is going and how i can save.

fast forward to last evening and i'm out with a group of acquaintances and someone's plumbing problem gets brought up, one of my friends is an awesome plumber and i manage to ask him at the tail end of the conversation about what i noticed on my bill. he seemed immediately alarmed and asked him if i noticed any water accumulation in my front yard. actually, yeah, it's been raining a lot lately but i do have a few persistent pockets left over on my yard. how did he know? this morning he actually brought his crew out to my house and found out there's a crack in my water main - i was losing hundreds of gallons a day and it was on the verge of rupturing completely. he replaced the line for a nominal fee and said how glad he was i said something - my area is really prone to sinkholes and nothing attracts them like pooling or leaking water. i likely saved tens of thousands of dollars in damage to my house and my neighbors house by bringing it up! not to mention the savings in my monthly bill...",10
"for refusing to pay at a restaurant that was false advertising?. so my girlfriend (her 27 me 28) wants to go to this fancy new restaurant in the city that she's heard good things about. we get there and it seems like one of those hipster places but whatever, i'm hungry. 

i look at the menu and this place is crazy expensive - like every dish is more than $15-$20 and half the ingredients i've never heard of. i order the bison steak ($26) and my girlfriend orders some weird pasta, noki i think ($18). very important, these were listed as entrees on the menu. mind you with drinks plus tip this is going to come out to over $60 which is already ridiculous for dinner for two people.

so anyway we order as we are starving. my steak arrives and i am shocked, it's like 6 small pieces of sliced steak with some weird sauce on the side and a small handful of salad. i joke to the waiter ""where's the rest of my steak?"" and he explains they serve smaller portions at this restaurant because they focus on getting the highest quality ingredients. i don't care if this bison was blessed by the pope himself it's absurd to charge that much for such a small bit of steak, it's highway robbery. when i go to restaurants i expect an entree to fill me up and be enough for leftovers.

i'm complaining to my girlfriend and she's getting annoyed with me. similar situation with her pasta it was like maybe 12 pieces of noki dressed up with some frou frou bullshit. granted the food was pretty good but i can not get over how tiny these portions are. i'm a big guy and i like to eat, what can i say. 

when the waiter comes back i inform him we will not be paying for our meal, and that they are falsely advertising entrees that barely qualify as a light snack. my girlfriend is begging me to stop but that's where we're different, i don't let businesses push me around and rip me off. 

a manager comes and apologizes but asks us to leave. i don't end up paying as they realized i called them out on their bullshit. my girlfriend is silent the entire time on the way back. im still hungry so i drive through mcdonald's and get a burger, and when i did that she asked to be dropped off at her place. it's now the next day and i'm starting to think i didn't handle the situation as well as i could have (i could have probably just asked for a discount). my girlfriend hasn't responded to my texts so now i'm starting to think i'm an asshole.

"i raised my credit score from 546 to 720 in 4 months thanks to you guys.. hello everyone, first let me say thank you. it is thanks to you that i finally, for the first time in my life, have control of my finances and can breath easier. i wanted to share my story in the hopes that someone else who was in a similar situation as me, might benefit from my experience. i will briefly describe how i raised my transunion and equifax scores from the 540s to the 720s in 4 months. something that i did not think was possible. and it was all thanks to...

https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5lgh97/i_raised_my_credit_score_by_73_points_in_3_months/


that subreddit. seriously. i followed the advice in there to the letter, and it worked like magic. here'es a bullet pointed version of exactly what i did: 

•	downloaded credit karma – saw that my score was 546 on jan 15th (was crushed, but felt like i was finally going to start taking control)

•	got my full credit report and list of all accounts that had gone delinquent and/or into collections.

•	called every. single. one. first i disputed every account, and over half (50%) of them could not prove that the accounts were real and/or could not prove that they followed the law pertaining to the fair credit act, and removed the accounts from my credit report.

•	in 30 days my score had gone from 546 to 620! i was elated, and more determined than ever. i felt like i was on a mission at this point. 

•	i applied for and was approved for a capital one secured credit card. it works like this – when your credit is so horrible that you cant get a real credit card to start boosting your credit, you get a secured card. basically, you pay them $200 for a credit card with a $200 limit.. i put $40 on the card every month, and paid it off completely.
 
•	i paid off all of my credit card debt.

•	of the delinquent and/or accounts that i had in collections that were not removed, i negotiated the debt down at every single one. i called them and basically said, ""i don't have enough money to pay my full debt, but i will give you x amount right now, (usually about half of what the debt was) to settle it and remove it from my report. they all had to get their manager's approval, but every single one of these  debt collectors accepted my offers. the way they look at it is like this – ""we either get half, or nothing"" 

•	after 60 days i was up in the 680s… couldn't be happier. then i did something that was not mentioned in the above subreddit..

•	i signed up for a service that sends out letters written on your behalf demanding that they show proof and accuracy of the negative item on your credit report. basically, you pay them a certain amount per month, and they send out attorney written letters to all credit reporting agencies, and debtors on your file, demanding that they prove they followed the law to the letter, and demand that if they cannot, then the record must be erased from my credit report. it's basically a team of attornies and paralegals that work on behalf of their clients to remove delinquent and collections accounts from their credit reports. 

•	less than half of the remaining collections could prove that they followed the process, so they removed the collections from my account. 

•	i then paid off the remaining 2 accounts (down from 17 accounts when i started this)

•	my credit score as of yesterday from both transunion and equifax is now 723. 

•	i applied for a real credit card from chase and was immediately approved for a credit card. 

and that's my story! 
tl;dr – call all your debtors, negotiate the debts down. get credit karma, be religious about not going over 30% of credit card limit, get a secured credit card.

again, thank you everyone on here who helped make this possible, i really wouldn't have been able to do it without you, and i mean that. thank you. 


edit: one huge thing i forgot to mention... i called into my auto loan company and asked them to remove some late payments that were on my report. i had about 4 late payments that were 30+ days, and 2 that were 60+ days. i asked them to remove some, and they did. overnight my credit score went up 22 points. 

edit 2: wow. thanks everyone for the response. i have received many messages from people who we're in a similar experience as i was when i started this journey. thank you so much for your comments and your messages. there are a couple of things i wanted to clear up however.


some people have perceived this guide as ""not ethical"" in the way i removed accounts from my credit report. 

i don't care. you don't have to follow my advice i'm just sharing what i did, and it worked for me. i hold no moral obligation to pay third party debt collectors mountains of money with their fees tacked in. i just played the game and i won. simple as that. you don't have to agree with how i did it, i just wanted to share what i did.

this was my whole letter.
i was told it was unprofessional by his assistant and that i should have called my boss to talk to him about leaving before submitting a formal notice so he knew why and what my plans are.
my mother works in the same company and she was contacted before me by the assistant to see what my plans are and why i want to quit. (i'm in my mid 20s living on the other side of the country as her and we talk sparsely, there's no precedent for her being questioned in my mind.) i was told he'd be contacting me soon, i gave up trying to contact him because he never responds.

i sent this late last month and i haven't heard anything from him whatsoever.

my new job is giving me a sign on bonus and doubling my annual salary so there's no chance i will be staying here at all. i want to know what you guys think and if there's something i should do that i may not know to do. thanks.


edit: 
- role, not roll. i goofed.
- i didn't actually use my reddit name in this letter 
- i work in a high specialty field in a high position. they won't be able to hire someone off the street, thus the reason for the long notice.
- boss was not contacted before hand because he has not responded to me for over a month prior. weeks-months at a time without response before that.
- boss lives and works >500 miles away. phone/email are the only ways to readily contact him.
- redacted info to be more anonymous",10

"for watching got on an airplane?. two days ago, i was on a long-haul flight. i was sitting in an aisle seat. since i haven't seen games of thrones yet, i was looking forward to binge watch the first season. i made myself comfortable and set up my tablet. an hour or two into watching, the woman two rows behind me tipped on my shoulder and told me that i need to turn it off immediately. a little bit confused, i asked why. she told me that her young son could see the show playing on my tablet and it's totally not suited for such young children because of the sex and violence involved in it. while i agree with that, i told her that i'm not going to turn it off. she then basically told me that i am an asshole for not considering other people around me. is she right?

edit: i want to clarify a few things that were mentioned in the comments:

\- i was wearing headphones all the time.

\- it was a flight with swiss from europe to a city in the united states. the in-flight entertainment system offered various movies and tv shows that were also not suited for children. however i have to admit that probably none was as bad as got. however, none of these shows was censored as far as i can tell.

"people on amitheasshole need to get a fucking grip.. just read a post there where a woman got three men fired from their jobs because she reported to hr the conversation she eavesdropped on in a bar. the men were discussing about who they find to be the best looking women in the office. in her defence she said she did not expect them to get fired but these fucking most upvoted answers man...  

""nta they got themselves fired!!""  

""nta they deserve it, bastards!!""  

are they fucking serious? i guarantee you that 90% of office workers have at one point discussed what people they work with they find  the most attractive and for them to lose their livelihoods over a drunken discussion that the women was not involved in nor did they realise she was intrusively listening is abominable. the lynch mob mentality on that subreddit and this website as a whole is a disgrace and that devalues the actual victims of workplace bigotry.   

people over on that subreddit see the world in black and white all while living on a self righteous power trip.",6
"my wife nearly died during the birth of my son three months ago. he was born very premature and he's had some physical challenges. we took him on his first flight and he was really well behaved. what did i choose to watch? finding nemo. very, very stupid choice.. tl;dr i was holding on to a lot of trauma, and the emotion came pouring out.

she had pre-eclampsia, which is not totally rare. but she only exhibited a headache and none of the other features until her blood pressure shot through the roof. he was born shortly after we were admitted to the hospital and while it was the happiest day of my life i haven't really had the chance to fully deal with the trauma of walking into a hospital thinking my pregnant wife would get a shot to quell a headache, only to haven't to confront the reality of possibly walking out alone. i chose not to focus on any of that. instead, i put my head down and concentrated on the things we could control.

he was in the nicu for several weeks and everyday we had to be strong parents for our son fighting for his life. and of course, once he graduated from the nicu we suddenly had a baby to turn into a full-grown human.

the lack of sleep is real. plus, post-partum and the grief of not experiencing the full-term has been very difficult for my wife. meanwhile, i'm a freelance artist who has been getting a lot of work recently after a very dry few months. basically, i've had absolutely no time to slow down and think about everything.

this was a transcontinental flight. he was marvelous. slept almost the whole way, even after our flight was delayed for 7 hours and we spent the entire day at the airport. my wife had held him most of the flight while i caught up on some work. but when her back was aching i took him and i looked for something to watch. i didn't want anything too stressful and i thought, ""finding nemo has that thomas newman score and the blue and orange will be soothing."" i had completely forgotten about the beginning. really, really dumb.

but i couldn't turn it off. even as the snot out-volumed the tears. in a sense, it was like an ice bath—at first, it stabbed me like a thousand knives but once i relaxed and let it wash over me, i felt that part of me begin to heal.

we're both starting therapy because we have a man to make and we can't be good parents without being ones who are as healthy as possible. this is just the beginning as a parent. but, i can't help but think that maybe 'finding nemo' helped me figure out just how much i'd been holding inside. which, is coincidentally kinda the whole point of the film: letting go.

edit: i just woke up and when i sat down to feed him his morning bottle i realized my phone was going crazy. this is crazy. i can't believe how much this has blown up! thank you everyone for your words of encouragement. i cannot adequately express how much that means to us.

also, to answer a little bit of a fair question, this is a fu because i didn't really choose the right venue for this, or stop to think that pixar is pretty much synonymous with sobbing. planes already heighten our insecurities so choosing a film that will surely make me cry in that environment was not a great choice.",4
"(update) school kept giving our son peanuts even though hes allergic. lawyers are expensive.... original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9x6enr/son_has_a_peanut_allergy_school_continues_to_give/

the past 3 months have been long and expensive but it's finally resolved. now i can't go into a lot of the details after but i can go over some of the details that happened during.

we contacted a few attorneys and finally found one we were comfortable with and then the fun started. we first sat down with the principal and teacher with our attorney and he didn't say anything except he needs to talk to someone else and not us.

our attorney then began collecting documents and statements/affidavits from our pediatrician, another doctor and even got another opinion. then he began having us get documents from the school, some of which they said we couldn't have but our lawyer assured us we could have them. so he sent the school district some nice letters and a few phone calls later we had everything. talking to our insurance and the hospital was the easiest part of this entire thing which i thought would be more complicated and our insurance even offered their attorneys services to our attorney which turned out to be quite helpful with some of the other issues that came up along the way.

he spent about a month going over everything, talking to doctors, getting more statements and reaching out to other parents etc. during this time our child was moved from his normal classroom and placed in a special needs classroom. something we did not agree to or with, our child has no developmental problems and an allergy hardly is a special need. 

so our lawyer then starts having us request more documents, same act with the school and he had to send off letters and phone calls to get the new stuff related to him being put into a special needs classroom. the lawyer began sending letters about how the school district is punishing our child with the move to a more restrictive classroom and a different curriculum and magically the next day he's back in a normal classroom.

finally after 3 months of mostly playing the game with the school district getting them to give us the paperwork and requests they are legally required to did we all finally sit down with the school districts attorney and our attorney.

now i can't go into a lot of the details but i can tell you they settled without us moving onto the next step of having our meetings in a courtroom. lawyers are expensive, and so are hospital bills. i just hope all of this doesn't make our child a target for the rest of the year. we are going to be moving and changing jobs over the summer hopefully. 

thanks for all your help and advice guys and girls, the plans everyone brought up for us to look over was incredibly important because we already had them on file with the school.",2
"by picking up a hitchhiker and then showing up to my own funeral. this happened a few years ago and i was living in zimbabwe at the time, and i was having a pretty bad day, i was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. if youre african you'll understnad that this  was no small journey. so i got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.

half an hour passes and we're making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so i do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he's throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).
i get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he's not.....then i here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so i wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. so i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. 

i explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where i am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). i start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so i pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and i dont have the best memory so i didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch i let him know the situaion and he says we're in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he's willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which i thought great!

its takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, i take down his number so i can repay him later on. at this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, i walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. im about 100 feet from the house and i see my son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. i get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like ive been gone for months. my auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.

i still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and i see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....


so it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what i had stumbled upon.
my son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.

tl;dr got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and i somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.

"negotiated a 17k raise after ~ 2 1/2 years of stagnation. feels great!. in july of 2014 i accepted a healthcare it position for a well known hospital. at the time, i had only 2 years of experience in the field and was fairly green. since then i have learned an overwhelming amount through my various assigned projects and my skillset has improved dramatically. after lurking in this sub for several months, i became increasingly agitated by my employer's inability to revisit my initial salary, which i know was considerably lower than my coworkers. coming to the conclusion that my salary would never increase without action from myself, i summoned the courage to talk to my boss. i demonstrated clear examples of how well i had adapted to the unique challenges of the job. it didn't take very long before he stopped me and said ""you don't have to say anymore. your work has been tremendous lately and we need to reappraise your salary."" 

unfortunately it took five gruelingly long months to get the last bit of approval needed through the awful bureaucracy that is my employer's hr, but i just received the news yesterday that it had been fully approved. effective in 3 weeks, i'll be making $82,000 from $65,000, and staying with the same employer.  i can't wait to up the percentage on my 401(k) and start putting more away each month. i'm still buzzing, and i'll always be a loyal follower of this sub!

"for yelling at a lady who was looking into my windows to stalk her son?. i'm 19f and live at home with my family. my younger brother 'mike' is 14. he is has a group of friends in the neighborhood that he always hangs out with, they all enjoy skating and longboarding and stuff so that's what they're doing most of the time. the boys are 14-15 and really nice kids but most of their moms are hella weird. they have a groupchat where they're secretly supervising the boys basically constantly updating where they are in the neigborhood. my mom was added to the chat and showed me the messages to have a laugh about it and it's honestly ridiculous they'll sent texts like ""i saw them at xy street 15 minutes ago"" ""they were in our garden 5 minutes ago i think now they're headed to the skate park"". i think it's hilarious because our neighborhood isn't dangerous at all.

one of the moms is especially annoying because she keeps calling our house and asking if her son 'jake' is there. we once were put in a groupchat together for a church project and since then she has my number and texts me all the time asking about the boys, because my mom won't respond.
 
now yesterday i was home alone at about 2pm because my mom was at work and my siblings were out. jakes mom had called my phone two times but i didn't answer cause she was annoying me. my boyfriend came over and we were just sorta chilling in the living room talking and listening to music. we were sitting on the couch and started to kiss and make out a bit. it was all nice and peaceful and suddenly i hear a really loud knock. it really made us jump because it was just so sudden. i turn to look and there's jakes freakin mom outside, knocking at the window. i nearly hit the ceiling i was so angry. i go outside and she's all like blah blah sorry to interrupt i just wanted to ask because i haven't seen jake in almost two hours ect.ect. apparently we didn't hear the doorbell because of the music so she just walked around the house to investigate and look in the windows. i really blew up at her saying that she's a weirdo who stalks her son everywhere and a freak to look in other peoples windows. i also asked her if her obsessive stalking was the reason for her divorce which probably went a little to far.

my boyfriend thought i was justified and my brother thought it was funny but my mom is mad at me because all the other moms are now blowing up her phone. she also thinks i shouldn't have said that stuff about the divorce.  i feel sorry for putting my mom in this position but i feel like someone needed to tell that lady how annoying her behavior is.",3
"girlfriend was arrested w/ a dui but blew a .06!!! cop arrested her after making her remove her glasses for the sobriety test!. so..... my girlfriend went out for a couple drinks with her friend tonight. she didn't drink much and she waited until she knew she was sober to drive home. when the time came she drove herself and her roommate home in her roommates car (well... was headed home). on her way she noticed that the headlights were off, and flipped them on a couple blocks down the road. a minute or two later she was pulled over by a police officer. she admitted to having a couple of drinks and the officer asked her to get out of the vehicle. 

this is when it gets interesting. 

the officer made her take her glasses off, in the dark... during a snow storm... to perform the sobriety test. he then declared that she was drunk without having her blow to test her bac, and arrested her on the spot and took her to jail. 

then, at the jail, she blew a .06!!! that's below the legal limit (we are in wyoming). and the lady at the booking desk told her to get an attorney when she heard what her bac was. 

my question is, does she have a  decent chance to be ruled innocent in a court of law? we have no money and probably can't afford a good lawyer. i could barely afford her bail. she is on track to be a school teacher and blowing a .06 shouldn't deter her from pursuing her dream. 

any advice would be greatly appreciated right now. we have two weeks before she has to appear in municipal court 

edit: she also told me this morning that when he arrested her he didn't tell her the miranda rights (found out he doesn't need to)


edit: thank you all so much for the help

"i lied about completing a project in the 8th grade and passed anyway.. i completely and 100% despised homework as a kid (and about half of my teenage years). when i was in the 8th grade, we were assigned a project towards the end of the year that counted for a pretty big percentage of our overall grade. from what i can remember, it had something to do with shapes and equations - it was basically like a large project of everything we learned the whole year. i didn't wanna do it. i worked on it a very small amount here and there, but never completed it. the math teacher collected them over a period of a few days, and then was going to spend a few more days grading them all. i played along to all of my other classmates that i turned mine in and even explained what it (maybe) looked like.

the day came and she was finishing up grading all of them, and as she finished each one she gave them back, so some students had already taken theirs home. so she's sitting at her desk and asks, ""spoopypuppy, have i graded yours yet?"" and i quickly replied, ""yes ma'am, you gave it back to me a couple days ago.""

some wonderful, powerful magic force was working hard that day, because all she said was, ""oh, i forgot to write your grade down. do you remember what it was?"" i didn't want to aim too high because i knew what work i was capable of, so i simply said, ""you wrote 89."" and she just wrote it down in her grade book!!!!! she didn't question to see it again or anything!!!

i couldn't believe it worked. that was the only time that ever worked, but it worked nonetheless. i passed math because of that lie. i did learn to just suck it up and do all the work from then on. ",11
"(update) my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile. link to original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/b6fd8u/my_22f_boyfriends_24m_new_tattoo_makes_me_feel/)

&#x200b;

i don't know what the hell has happened but things have turned into an absolute clusterfuck.

i received some really great advice from people and honestly thought talking to him was going to work out well. i was still pretty nervous though and not sure how to bring it up. his mood has been pretty touch and go lately so i was worried about picking the right moment and kept putting it off until later in the night when he tried initiating sex and i thought that was a good time to start the conversation.

i basically said i know you've noticed something's been off lately and thats because i haven't been entirely comfortable during sex since you got your new tattoo. i absolutely love it for what it is and what it stands for but it's just difficult for me to stay in the moment because it's really hard not to look at it and be reminded of what happened. i stopped here to see what his reaction would be so far and he was just silent for awhile and then said ""so... what? you want me to get rid of him?""

i ***explicitly*** said ""no i would never ask you to do that"" and then told him it might just take me some time to get used to it until its not so noticeable anymore and in the meantime maybe he could keep his shirt on during sex or we could try some other ideas. this is where shit started to hit the fan. he said all that sounded ridiculous to him and that i was being extremely insensitive and selfish and ""honestly sick' for even associating his little brother with sex and asked if i was fucking sick in the head.

i fucked up here. i shouldn't have said this but i don't handle confrontation well and i pretty much lost my cool at this point. i told him to go jack off to a picture of his brother and tell me how that makes him feel. he completely exploded at this point saying that was a disgusting thing to say (i agree) and started calling me a number of names. he then started to get extremely personal saying i never cared about his little brother and that i'm probably happy he's out of the picture.

that is hand down the most hurtful thng he has ever said to me. i still cant bellieve it and i don't think i'm ever going to forgive hm for that. like seriously what the fuck? just thinking about it is makng me fucking shake. he knows exactly how i feel about his brother and how hard his death was for both of us and for him to stil say something like that? he can seriously go fuck himself because i'm definitely not gonna be doing it anymore.

he then started shoutng that if it was seriously that big of a deal for me that he would get the whole thing layered off but he hopes i know i'm basically killing his brother all over again??? i was crying so much at this point i didn't get a chance to respond before he stormed out of the house and just took off. i have no idea where he's gone or where he is and i honestly don't even know if i care at this point. he's not answering his phone or responding to any messages.

i still can't believe he reacted the way he did. he was like a completely different person. not once in the four years i've know him out of all the arguments we've had has he ever spoken to me like that before. i was up all night on the phone to my sister and she was just as shocked as i was.

then this fucking morning i get a lovely fucking call from my boyfriend's sister who called me disgusting and heartless and evil for forcing him to remove the tattoo. apparently he's been going around to his family and alllour friends telling them i've given him an ultimatum of me or his tattoo.

what the fuck?!?! i explicitly told him i would never ask him to do that. when i told his sister this she just called me a lying fucking bitch, wished all my siblings dead and then hung up. feckin lovely.

i seruiously don't know why he's reacted the way he has or why he's going around lying about me making him get rid of it. i'm still in total shock and just so confused. i hoped typing all this out would help me figure things out a little but reading this over has just made me angrier. i don't see what i could have done differently? i shouldn't have made the jack off comment, that's clearly what set him off but that doesn't explain why he's lying now to everyone.

i'm just at a complete loss right now. a day ago i thought of this guy as my future husband and now i just don't know. i wish i never said anything.

i've spent four years of my life with this guy but this is a side of him i've never seen before. im so upset right now my imeddiate thought is to just cut things off completely. how the fuk would we even move froward from this? am i the one in the wrong here for the comment i made? i know i shouldn't have said it but i personally think he completely overreacted to it. and how am i supposed to convince our friends he's the one lying here? anything i sy is just going to sound like i'm lying in response to their negative reactions. i seriously have no idea what im supposed to do here. i feel like this is going to ruin my life.

i just don't fucking know.

"update man broke into my house and is now claiming squatters' rights. update to this(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/dyfi1b/man_broke_into_my_house_and_is_now_claiming/) post.

thanks again for all of the advice.  i can finally say that i'm spending the night in my own home again!

after the police told me that they couldn't ""evict"" i contacted a local attorney.  most of his experience is as a trial lawyer but he took interest in my case and decided to work pro bono.  he contacted law enforcement who, once they heard everything from him, were much more sympathetic.  the police officers then went to my house, talked to the squatter, and he decided to vacate on peaceful terms.  

upon entering my house the interior was absolutely trashed.  windows were broken.  there was garbage everywhere. luckily there's no major structural damage and i should be able to clean everything up. he didn't take anything of real value, it looks like he only took some old movies i had sitting around.

my attorney has, unfortunately, said that cases like these aren't uncommon in the area and the county's da office often fails to prosecute them.  my attorney doesn't have many good things to say about the da so he might just have an ax to grind.

i'm going to go start cleaning up now.  thanks again for all of the advice.  it's great to be back home.",2

my son has moved back in with me last weekend.

the older man had apparently stopped working and was drinking heavily and being very loud and critical of my son.

i got a phone call from my son on saturday with him in tears and asked me to help him.

i jumped into my car and brought him home. i also yelled at the man and told him i'm calling the cops.

i then called an officer i knew to accompany us back to the apartment so we could get his stuff.

when we got there it looked like the man had moved out in a hurry.

so while the locks get changed by the wonderful landlord, my son is back home with me.

i'm happy he is rid of that predator but i'm extremely sad my son felt he had to get companionship from a man like that.

i have setup therapy appointments that my son will actually be attending now.

i hope with all my heart he can find the happiness he is looking for.

"90% of beauty standards women feel are enforced by other women, not men. it's crazy to me that there's so much talk about toxic masculinity, but toxic femininity is ingrained in our society and no one bats an eye. 

cosmo, vogue, fashion shows, reality t.v. who is really perpetuating the unattainable standards for women to be skinny, to have matching outfits, to wear loads of makeup and possess flashy jewelry. most guys, in my experience, never complain or even notice shit like that. but every woman i have known talks shit behind other girl's backs or to their face. and a lot of these are impressionable, young girls that drive so much toxicity. 

and if we're talking about gender standards, there has been a huge reverse in standards against men in the last decade. if men even desire a woman to be in shape or presentable, there's an uproar of sexism. but most women are able to have a laundry list of expectations for men and it goes unchecked. its ludicrous.

tl;dr: women have unnecessary beauty standards placed on them but it has nothing to do with men. this is toxic femininity and it's dangerous. sorry this was so long.

edit: okay obviously i didn't expect this to blow up as much as it did so i would like to clarify some things. 

1. this thread was not made to bash women whatsoever. i have no control over the comments made here or if they misconstrued my original point. people who are using this as a platform to ridicule women are doing the exact opposite of having a civil debate.

2. i am simply drawing attention to the fact that we as males are told constantly why we are perpetuating toxic masculinity. but there are huge examples of toxic femininity in our society and this is one of them.

3. people refuting this with facts or having a civil discussion, thank you. those calling me mysogynistic or saying this post is a circle jerk, i think it's important to look outside your bias and see maybe women have a lot to work on if they want to strive for a less toxic society. it starts with themselves, calling for women to be held accountable is not mysogynistic.",6

"for asking a 47 year old man who is dating my 22 year old niece some pointed questions that made him ""uncomfortable""?. using a throwaway. some context; i live in ca, and my wife's niece wanted to come visit us for a few weeks. she's 22, i've known her since she was 4. her dad walked out on her family when she was 8. she's very sheltered by her mother. anyway, i told my wife it was fine with me if she visits. she's a good kid, and our 5 year old son loves his cousin and really wanted to see her.

but then my wife goes, ""and she (the niece) wants to bring her bf.....he's 47.""

i'm 41, my wife is 42. i was like ""you're kidding, right?""

she wasn't kidding. at first, i was like ""hell no."" but after about a week of talking, i gave in....with one caveat. i told my wife that if this dude is staying in our house, i'm going to ask some questions he might not like. she wanted to know what kind of questions, and i gave her some.

1. how did you guys meet and who made the first move? (if the dude made the first move, it's weird).

2. has the dude been married, does he have kids?

3. why are you (the dude) dating such a young woman?

4. are you (the dude) aware of the young woman's history with her father? 

5. what's the end game here? a serious relationship, marriage? have you (the dude) discussed what will happen if the young woman gets pregnant?

i know, i'm not the girl's father, but no one else in her family is asking these questions. her mother is fine with the relationship (which boggles my mind). 

so, fast forward to the visit. niece and old dude show up. i'm cordial. i wait till evening, after everything is settled and dinner is over, and i invite the dude to join me on the porch for a beer. just me and him. then i start asking my questions. 

after only my second question, the guy starts getting defensive. he told me this is ""none of my business."" i got a little pissed at that. 

i told him he's staying in my home for a week, i can ask him a few questions. and the girl is my niece, i'm not out of bounds here. he told me i was making him ""uncomfortable"". i replied that i'm uncomfortable having a dude who's clearly taking advantage of a young girl stay in my home. i said you can answer my questions and act like you're a stand-up guy, or feel free to hit the fucking road.

well, he left. my wife and niece were upset with me. they said i acted like a jerk and that if my niece is happy, to let it go. again, i was told it's none of my business. they have since broken up, which i am glad about. not sure if my actions were the cause.

so am i an asshole for questioning this guy?

edit: some info:

i asked my questions in the order written, and only asked him the first two before he got ""uncomfortable"".

i would certainly do the same thing with any older woman my son brought home. 

when i took the old dude outside for a beer, i neglected to mention we had 5-10 mins of talk. we discussed the new star wars movies of all things.

i would love to discuss more with some of you, but i was a bit hot-headed and appropriately banned for 5 days. so it goes.

edit 2: some of you here asked what's up with my wife and her sister. her side of the family suffer from innocent naivety and just assuming everyone they meet is a good person. they're wonderful people who need an asshole like me to keep them centered.

final edit: some of you wondered if i would accept any of the dudes answers to my questions. of course, all he had to be was respectful and honest in answering and i wouldn't have a problem. 

talked to my niece this morning. she and i are totally fine. knew my actions came from wanting to keep her safe. i apologized for my actions regardless. 

asked why they broke up.

the guy was cheating on his wife. he confessed it to her and said he would get a divorce for her. has three kids. all her age or older. she dumped him.",3
"update my 29m fiancee 28f of 4 years randomly claimed i abused her, and called the police. this came completely out of the blue.. edit: previous post here(https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/cba218/my_29m_fiancee_28f_of_4_years_randomly_claimed_i/)

okay so this is going to be a weird ass update. i'm sorry if you guys thought this was going to be anything interesting. 

a friend came forward and told me that apparently my dumb ass fiancee decided to play a prank on me. she had the bright idea of leaving the house for a couple of days to set up a surprise birthday party for me set for this weekend. i don't know what the fuck she was thinking, nor do i even really know the full story yet. she is not really the prank playing type and i guess thought this would be hilarious or something. 

it looks like a majority of those ""friends"" who were acting distant were in on it. after i started being up front and honest with showing people my texts with her as this sub suggested, one of them told her that this wasn't cool, and that if she didn't come clean, than he would. well, she didn't come clean, and he came forward. i guess that's why nobody was answering their texts?  

anyway, i texted her and i told her that i knew, asked her what the fuck she was thinking. she started blowing my phone up apologizing. she said her prank just went too far and spiraled out of control when it got to social media, and that she didn't know how to come clean when she realized that it crossed a line. she also said that she didn't mean to let it come out that i was abusing her, and that she just wanted to make it seem like she left me, and that the abuse stuff was a rumor started by some other people who weren't in on her joke. 

i just didn't really respond to her. i left and went to my parents' house before she got back home. my family now thinks she's a fucking moron, so her relationship with them is ruined right before our marriage, so that's great. our mutual friends are now split in half with half of them thinking she's an idiot, and the other half feeling god knows what about the situation. i'm frankly embarrassed, and feel stupid for wasting everyone's time and dragging them into my relationship with my fiancee. 

i don't really know where to go from here. i don't know if i should call of the wedding, or postpone it and try to work out what the hell went through her mind. 

i'm sorry if this isn't the ending to the story you were all hoping for. i'm having drinks and will be here all night feeling sorry for myself and answering comments for as long as i'm awake with this jameson. 

tl;dr: this was actually just a stupid prank by my fiancee.",7
"if we should blame anyone for the lack of action on climate change, it should be greenpeace.. because they killed the viability of nuclear power, the only power source that is clean and can produce enough power to meet our demands without needing to change much about the industry.

because of their crusade on gmos, which would feed millions of people and reduce the amount of farmland we would need exponentially. 

because their use of bullshit alarmist talking points has become common practice among environmental activists and has caused several people to become apathetic towards a very important issue.

and because they are a bunch of twats whose publicity stunts irreversibly damaged a unesco heritage site and caused the deaths of millions because of their crusade against ddt.

they personify everything wrong with the environmental movement. they have essentially killed every viable strategy we have to combat our impact on the environment in the eyes of the public and ruined the perception of the movement as a whole. they are the reason we aren't doing jackshit about climate change, because their anti-science activism has ruined the reputation of every technology that could yield the most results.

edit #1: a slight correction on the ddt point. it was only banned worldwide in 2001, but is still used in small quantities to combat large infestations of mosquitoes. it was also linked to several health defects in humans and animals. however, it doesn't change the fact that malaria kills 3000 children every day and that ddt is still the most effective way to combat it, at least in reasonable doses.

"for sending my son to school in a dress. my son started second grade last week. i get the kids ready for school while my wife sleeps (she's got a graveyard shift). 

he's got a twin sister. i told them both it was time to get ready for school and his twin sister pulled a bunch of dresses out of her closet. my son picked one up and said ""i want to wear this."" i'm thinking, whatever dude, we're running late just put some kind of clothes on and let's get out the door. i'm pretty politically neutral so while i wouldn't say i was particularly happy he wanted to wear a dress, it also wasn't nearly as upsetting to me as the idea that i could be late for work if we didn't get out the door. 

i figured ok, i wouldn't ever tell my daughter not to do something because it wasn't ladylike so i shouldn't tell my son not to do something because it isn't manly. 

i drop him off and get to work. three hours later we get a call to come pick up our son because his outfit is distracting to the other kids and he's being bullied. he was very sad when my wife got there and the whole morning had been upsetting for him. 

my wife is irate asking how i couldn't have realized that was inappropriate and i was setting our son up to fail. so is just about everyone else i've run this by. my wife thinks damage has been permanently done because he'll be in the same school system as these kids the rest of his life and he'll be known as ""the one who wore a dress"" and i was being thoughtless or willfully ignorant because i was in a rush and our son suffered for it. 

at the time, i truly didn't think it was that big a deal, but that doesn't change that i put my son in harm's way so now i'm not sure whether i made the wrong decision or not or how to feel about it. aita",3

"by being funnier than my so and allowing her to post it on reddit.. this happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. 

last night while my so was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. she is a bartender and didn't want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. 

me, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. so i jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. 

while i'm making my journey, i decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. i'm in a pretty great mood. i had the day off and my so was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some new girl. 

my journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. just open desert. so while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. ""what can i do to add a little romance to this situation? cover the bed in some dove chocolates? maybe some flowers?"" 

i make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. miraculously, i made it back home before her.

finally i decide, ""nah, romance isn't nearly as great as comedy."" so when i get home, i break open the box and spell out ""anal?"" on the bed with the tampons. 

so gets home and goes straight to the room to change. i follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. 

she takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. now she won't stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is ""famous"". 

i've created a monster. 

tldr; spelled out ""anal?"" with my so's tampons. she thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. reddit agreed and now she thinks she's famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.

"i met my current boyfriend by slipping him my number while he was on a date with someone else and i was their server.. i used to work at a cheesecake factory as a server. about 1.5 years ago my current boyfriend came in with some other girl for a date. i'm not sure what it is about my boyfriend but he just does it for me. he's not at all my normal type of guy i'm attracted to but for some reason he just makes me melt every time i look at him. 

he's got this super self assured smile and something about the way he talks gets me. he's got this little chuckle he does and he always looks down and bites his lip after...he's just like **it** for me. 

so i immediately rushed over to their table. typically, if i saw a guy i was attracted to i could give better service because i genuinely wanted to interact with him and everyone at the table and that usually lead to nicer tips. 

when i started serving them, i couldn't help myself and i was flirting super obviously. so much so my coworkers were telling me to be careful i didn't get complained on. but he flirted back so i was like a shark who smelled blood in the water. 

i spent so much time talking to him at their table other tables i was serving had to call out to me because i'd forget about them. 

honestly, looking back that was more of a date for me and him than her and him because we talked about what he did for work, what i studied, what my favorite foods are, what he likes, music. i must have been at that table, accumulatively, for around 40 minutes.

at the end of it she was being very short with me and him and i kind of figured she'd complain. so i said screw it, scribbled my number down and put it under his card when i gave it back to him.

"another example for why having an emergency fund is 1000x better than having more/nicer things. my wife and i are in our early/mid twenties. we have saved a little more than a third of our income over the past two years so we had several thousand dollars in an emergency fund plus extra savings. the amount isn't really relevant - the point is that we had no plans to use it. 

at the end of 2016 we were both in great health, and being young we decided to go with my employer's hdh plan with an hsa. last weekend we blew through the deductible on my wife and we will likely hit the out of pocket maximum before the month is over. this health issue came out of nowhere and we're very fortunate to have good insurance. 

but because we have extra savings, we don't have to make medical decisions based on cost. we can pay the full annual out of pocket maximum and we won't really miss it. if a doctor thinks a test is necessary we can simply authorize it without worrying about how we will pay for it. it has been stressful but i can't imagine how much more stressful it would be if we had to go into medical debt to pay for it all. 

we could have eaten out more last year. my wife could drive a nicer car. we could live in a bigger apartment or house. but i wouldn't trade the freedom of having the extra savings for any of that. 

this came out of nowhere and was frankly highly unlikely. it could happen to anyone.  and we were easily able to pay for it. an emergency fund is psychologically, emotionally, physically, and financially is the most important improvement to your quality of life that you can ""buy."" in my opinion anyway. 

edit: thanks to all for your well wishes and support. to those who took this as a criticism of spending, please know that this was not my intention. my wife and i are not ultra frugal - we simply prioritize our spending where we think it will have the greatest impact on our lives. in my view, an emergency fund is just another thing you ""buy."" i feel that, of all the things anyone could buy, it is the one that will have the greatest impact on your quality of life.",10
"by accidentally pulling out my gf's tampon while watching tv. yesterday evening my gf and i thought it would be nice to watch lord of the rings after coming home quite late. after aproximately 4 hours i was really tired and couldnt think straight anymore. she had her ""strawberry week"" so she was plugged, which i frankly didnt care too much about. we just came along the credits in the movie and i was casually stroking her ass when i realised there is a thread hanging somewhere.

i thought its just a random thread from the blanket, you know the ones hanging from some clothes.

i think it was muscle reflexes or something like this, my tired brain didnt think at all and i just pulled hard without realising of what i just did.

my girlfriend said: "" wtf are you do-"" and it was already out creating a mess everywhere until i realised what actually happened.

after explaining that i thought its from the blanket, my gf couldnt stop laughing and i felt quite ashamed. made up the bed right after and went to sleep right next to my still giggling gf.

**tl;dr:** accidentally ""unplugged"" my girlfriend while watching a movie creating a mess in my bed

"i (34m) just found out that my 3 year old daughter is actually my brothers daughter. wife(35f) claims rape but brother has a different story. idk what to do anymore.. i'm posting because i cannot share this with my family and i can't talk to my friends either.

wife and i have been married for 4 years, together for 12. last month, my entire life was upended by my brother( older ) and my wife. my brother was my hero. he was there for me when my parents abandoned us. he was there for me when i struggled with depression. he's like a father figure to me. 

so my brother called me and asked me if he could come over and meet me at my office. he told me that it was very important. we met up for lunch that day and he told me that he did something terrible and he was really sorry. he told me that my wife had sex with him before we got married because she claimed that she was really stressed at that time and he was drunk. 

apparently, my wife contacted him recently and told him that our daughter could be his. and he also started suspecting it. i was really shocked by this revelation. because my wife never told me about this. and i never imagined she would cheat on me.

but when i confronted my wife, she started crying and told me that she was raped by my brother before our wedding and she ended up getting pregnant with his child. she didn't realise it at that time, and she didn't want to hurt my relationship with my brother, so she decided to hide it. but my brother claims it was consensual. 

we ended up getting a paternity test and it was revealed that my daughter is not mine. i just want to kill myself. my brother told me that he would pay child support and take responsibility for the child. wife claims that she was raped and she doesn't want my brother in our lives. 

i'm really torn. i don't think my brother is a rapist. but i'm also having a hard time believing that my wife cheated. also, she never told me this. she had a normal relationship with my brother all this time. idk what to do now. i think i'm just leaving. but i want some advice to cope up.",7
"for propositioning a girl in the gym?. please hear me out before you judge because while i did say what you're thinking i didn't say it in the way you're thinking.

the gym i go to is very small. not a lot of machines and not a lot of patrons. this means working out fairly close to people even if you don't mean to. yesterday i (23 f if it makes a difference) was on the extended leg press doing my thing when a girl and her boyfriend began working out on the machine beside me. (one would do a set while the other waited beside them) the girl looked at me, rolled her eyes and muttered to her boyfriend ""ugh i hate girls who only come to the gym to get a big ass.""

i shrugged her off, and kept doing my thing. i was on the assisted pull up machine doing an exercise where you put one foot on the pad and push downwards (apologies for not knowing the name, my trainer showed me it so i'm not entirely sure if it's an actual well known exercise) 

the same girl looks at me, tuts and says to her bf ""look there she goes again, and her forms terrible."" which is possibly true but she pissed me off.

at this point i call her out. i said ""oi, you."" she immediately looked like she shit herself and ignored me. so i called her out again specifically ""you in the purple top."" 

she turned round and asked what i wanted. the following conversation happens:

me; do you want to fuck me?
her: what?!
me: i said do you want to fuck me?
her: what the fuck is wrong with you?
me: well you keep staring at me, so i'm assuming you either want to fuck me or fight me, so which is it?

she went bright red, grabbed her boyfriends arm and went to the changing rooms. i carried on with my workout and didn't see them again.

when i told my friend what happened, he said i acted like a dick and that as a woman i should know how much it sucks to be objectified in the gym. he also pointed out that i embarrassed her in front of everyone and ruined her and her bfs work out. 

my defence is she should also know how much it sucks to make people make disparaging comments about you in the gym and that she shouldn't talk shit if she doesn't want called out on it.

i'll admit that i'm a pretty confrontational person and i could have reacted better but i also think she should mind her own business.",3

"askscience ama series: we are scientists here to discuss our breakthrough results from the event horizon telescope. aua!. we have captured the first image of a black hole. ask us anything!

the event horizon telescope (eht) — a planet-scale array of eight ground-based radio telescopes forged through international collaboration — was designed to capture images of a black hole. today, in coordinated press conferences across the globe, eht researchers have revealed that they have succeeded, unveiling the first direct visual evidence of a supermassive black hole and its shadow.

the image reveals the black hole at the centre of messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby virgo galaxy cluster. this black hole resides 55 million light-years from earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the sun

"by buying a used playstation 2 on letgo that caused me to face my worst fear.. this happened only minutes ago.


the graphics card in my old ps2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so i decided to replace it when i had a little extra cash. i was out browsing different sites like craigslist and the like, when i stumbled upon the ps2 mentioned in the title. it looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.


at the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.


now, i should preface this by saying that i have a strange faith in the honesty of others. benefit of the doubt and all that noise. after all, the car i drive now is one i bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. why should this be any different?


starting to sound like a mistake yet?


if the answer is ""no,"" then have no fear. that is almost certainly about to change. the model the seller advertised on letgo was one of the larger black brick models. like, the first generation ones. when i finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. when he showed me the goods, it was actually one of the slim and silver ps2's from later in the console's production run. he told me he had already sold the larger one.


my first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that i should have walked away when i saw i was being sold something that was improperly advertised. unfortunately for me (and i guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), i was not in the most logical mood. it was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. i just wanted to get this thing and go home.


back at the ole ranch, i hooked up the console, slapped in kingdom hearts ii, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. i'm off work and done with class, what else would i do with my evening, right? i was pretty happy with my life until i realized i had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn't reading. strange, but not altogether discouraging. i slapped in another game that i new for sure was working. didn't read. i repeated this several times with discs i knew would work; same story.


now i'm starting to get slightly pissed. i'm sure you can see where this next part is going.


i open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. i've now got no way to contact him. of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. all i could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. that, or i could get onto youtube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. i picked the latter option and went on my merry way. after a video about a quick mod i could make to the system, i was feeling pretty confident that i was going to get the last laugh on this one.


oh golly gee fuck was i wrong.


now at this point, i begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. i manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. it's putting up a little more of a fight than i saw in the videos, but why wouldn't it? it was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. with a little elbow grease, it starts to give. i'm also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. a bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so i can live with that. the further i get it open, the more rust i see on some more critical pieces. i'm sweating again, but holding out hope. finally, the plastic casing comes free, and i experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.


i experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.


you see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. the first thing i notice is that the inside is covered in rust. the second thing i notice is that some of the rust is moving.


oh, that's not all rust.


*ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*


do you know that scene in raiders of the lost ark where indiana jones is like, ""snakes. why did it have to be snakes?"" that was me. except with cockroaches. they are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. and now they're crawling on my hands. and these are the quick little tiny ones that don't give two fucks about whether you've stepped on them or not. i threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.


they're getting everywhere now. i'm yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. you would think that something caught fire with the way i was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. tiny, $25 freaks of nature. eventually i managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point i grabbed a can of raid from the laundry room and finished the job.


at least, i *hope* i finished the job. i'm fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point i'm a little too emotionally drained to care. i also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that i *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. jesus, it's only 3 in the afternoon and i already need a stiff drink.


tl;dr: i bought a used ps2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.

edit: hi, reddit! i just wanted to say many thanks for the gold and all the offers for cockroach-free playstations!  warms my heart, and i'm super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. happy redditing!",4
"by my wife and i referring to ""no"" as the ""n word"" with our 12 month old son and having child protective services called on us. so my wife and i have a four year old and a one year old.  when our one year old is up to mischief and we tell him ""no"" he immediately looks up at us and starts crying.  it's actually pretty adorable.

in order not to upset him we frequently refer to it as the ""n word"" when he's around.  

queue two weeks ago when our four year old is in daycare and telling all his friends and the teacher that ""mommy and daddy use the n word all the time and it upsets his brother and makes him cry"".  teacher berated my wife and told her we were horrible people and didn't really get it when my wife explained that it was a big mix up.

we also got child protective services called on us anonymously.  think it's the teacher but it may have been a parent.

tldr: everyone at our kids school thinks we are constantly throwing ""the bad n word"" around our sons and are horrible people and parents.

"my favourite thing working as a window washer was going through peoples private possessions.. so i worked as a window washer in my small town in sweden for about 5 years.

every morning you went to the warehouse were we had all of our stuff, drank a cup of coffee with your co-workers and talked for a bit before getting to know the places you had to go to that day, and who you had to do them with.

our bosses were very keen on everyone getting to know everyone so they changed up the ""teams"" every day.

this meant sometimes you got to go out by yourself.

a typical workday is going to 4-5 houses and/or apartments, sometimes old people (they were always home), sometimes familys who were home because they knew we were coming. not very often, you got people who left their key under the mat and let us go inside without them being home.

i likes this the most, since you didn´t have anyone breathing down your neck while you worked.

and sometimes, once in a blue moon, you got a house, with nobody home, by yourself.

i don't know if there´s something wrong with me (maybe).

but to me it felt like i had struck gold, because i knew, i would be able to walk around that house, by myself, checking out every inch of it.

i usally started by doing my job super fast! make sure i had some way of knowing if they got home.

usally i placed a ladder somewhere close to the door so if someone came home they had to move it.

then i got to work.

i never looked to steal anything, it was pure curiosity.

i looked through bathroom cabinets, nightstands, desk drawers and basically anything that you could open, while making sure everything i touched was placed back exactly where  it was before.

&#x200b;

during my years i´ve found diaries with dark secrets, cute secrets and just downright wierd secrets.

i´ve found used condoms in the teenage boys room, dildos and vibrators in the daughters/mothers nightstands.i found a gun under a matress (which in sweden is not something you see everyday)

one couple had a sex-swing hanging in the bedroom, so it´s not really something i needed to look for but i thought it was strange that they didn't take it down when they knew people were going to be in the house.

i once opened a teenagers macbook, and boom, pornhub, paused mid-video.

no password.

no incognito window, nothing.

jewelry, expensive watches and knifes.

one kid had a 3 knifes welded toghether like a ninjastar but with a handle.

&#x200b;

like i said. never stole anything. that wasn't my goal.

i just loved going though other peoples shit.

it´s wrong. i know that.

but i couldn´t help myself.",11
"by making myself an uncle nsfw. so this started 2 weeks ago

i went to my mom's house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a gf.

 naturally i start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn't exist, very cliche stuff. i get to teasing him about him not losing his v card, my mom is not liking the conversation. his gf ends up coming over, i stopped the teasing i'm not a monster. so i'm talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she's a half decent girl says she's throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. i tell her not to worry about it i'll talk her into letting my brother go out.

i get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. my argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised ying and yang i grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. he grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. saying how a party would be good for him i even offered to go, (i'm only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, i told her he's old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn't want him to make that mistake (i know how that sounds). so i finally convinced her she agreed.

so i decide that i need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. i knew my bro was losing it that night. fast forward to the party, i drop him off so my mom thinks imma be there. i pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he's hung over not wanting to answer. 

skip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she's pregnant and going to keep it. well holy fuck did i get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  so now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and i'm becoming an uncle.

tl;dr convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his v card, he got his gf pregnant. 


update 1: so she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. so we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. i'm on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. my brother is getting tested for sti's i was all over him about that. also thanks for the gold and silver (i have no idea what that does). thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. 

update 2: everyone is asking for an update, can't really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. my brother does not have any sti's or std's my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,i'm helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. there are quite a few of you wondering what the ""teenage gang stuff"" was you can dm and i can explain what i did if curious, how i got out, how my life has changed and all. 

update 3: *in maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! mother is crying brother is in shock and the gfs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. everyone pray for this child. 


update 4: they are keeping the kid, mom still doesn't talk to me, i helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. i've started a savings account for him, and my gf and i are going to move into a place with him and his gf to help them out.",4
"girlfriend (22f) mad about my (24m) answer to scenario, what do i do?. so girlfriend and i had just finished having sex. we were laying there just cuddling and not saying anything, i was dozing off and then she randomly said ""your love for me is unconditional right?"" and i mean i say that all the time so i didn't think much of it and i said ""yes, i will love you no matter what,even if you had one eye or 12 fingers"" and it was clearly a joke. she kisses me but then says "" so if i turned into a donkey right now you would still love me?"" .... i was confused because it was such a random question and i laughed and just said ""i don't know about that, i'd love you as a pet i guess""

she sits up and says ""are you fucking serious?!"" at this point i'm completely lost. i just sat there and she says ""as a pet... that's it?"" i said ""i mean yes.. if you were an animal... what would you expect me to do?..."" she says ""still love me like you just claimed that you did, it's funny how if it were you who had transformed into a donkey i would still love you unconditionally and i would not treat you like 'a pet'"" .... i had no idea what was going on and how we even ended up in this argument. i just said "" if you were a donkey how else was i supposed to love you aside from being a pet?? am i supposed to treat you like my girlfriend still??"" she says ""i'm not saying you would have to take a donkey on a date.. but you knew it was me so why would your love me suddenly change just because of my appearance?!"" ... i just stopped talking because i didn't want to say anything else wrong. 

i'm just confused. she was so upset that she got her clothes on and slept on the couch. what did i say? i have no idea what exactly she was upset about. am i not looking into this deep enough? i'm genuinely confused as to what i did and how to fix it. i don't want to say something and make it worse.

"tsa detained, roughly handled my terminally ill father and his port, causing us to go to the er and possibly miss out on experimental treatment.. i'm going to try to state this as calmly as possibly.

my father has cancer, walks with a cane/wheelchair, and has a port(https://www.cancer.gov/images/cdr/live/cdr756805-750.jpg) for his treatments that is a tube from the side of his chest going to his heart.  we came to this country 20 years ago, both my parents speak english well with an accent that is not so thick people have difficulty understanding them in our city (new york) facing the customer directly at our shop. they sometimes get syntaxes, plurals, and slang wrong, but it's not hard to figure out, my father read the times daily and has given lectures at a college. i'll gladly post an audio clip of them speaking if needed. however, the cancer and medication make him very soft spoken, and his hearing isn't that great (he's nearly 70) and when very upset or flustered, can have a hard time finding the right words. 
 

today, they were flying from tn (i don't want to name the airport yet, but if needed will do) where my sister and her family live, to houston, tx, where my father is undergoing some experimental treatments for his cancer.   he had permission to travel, and with him brings a note from his oncologist from home (brooklyn, ny) and in texas, which includes a diagram of the port but not a full list of medication (which i will request from his doctors tomorrow)  he also brings a printout from the tsa about traveling with a port and cancer which i will find the exact link to when i get more info.  

my parents arrive 3:45 to a tennessee airport for a 6:00 flight. 
both parents have tsa pre and get on line at about 4. they are told to get out into the other line, they show their tickets, and the agent consults another while they wait, the other agents letting people past them.  the agents start questioning my father on where he is going, his name, the address on the id, etc.  my father is having difficulty understanding the agents accent, which is very thick, and the agent is responding by speaking louder and louder and more drawn out, making it even harder to understand. meanwhile i assume he is not speaking his best english, either, as he is flustered and has been standing a while now, but he is trying his best. i'm not sure if they asked about the port at this point but my father tries to give them the info and doctors note he has brought, which i think adds to the confusion. they wave him away, scribble something on his and my moms ticket, and eventually get escorted by a third agent to the precheck line. they don't know why someone walked them to the line, it wasn't to help my dad walk or anything.

both parents put their things on the scanner, and an agent tells my dad to remove his kufi (he does) and gets a consult with another agent if my mother needs to remover her hijab (she doesn't, as they finally agree on, but later while patting her down, my mother says they nearly pulled it off several times.)  they go through the bags and bring out my fathers medication and tells him he needs prescriptions for it, he gives them the notes, they say they will hold it until after the pat down.   my father says thats ok, again reiterates he has a port and they cannot touch it.  he calls it a 'device' at one point which causes the agents to start speaking loudly at once, my father stands with his hands in the air while my mother tries to explain.  he tries to show it to them and they yell at him to 'not undress' (his first has a button front placket, he literally undid one button and pushed to the side, not 'undress' at all.) they take him into a small room away from my mother. he is roughly pated down 'like you would in a prison' (still unsure what exactly he means) but it took much longer than expected.  the agent starts pressing hard on his port and my father cries out. the agent begins to lecture him and say it's needed and they have to figure out what it is, at once point trying to pick up/pull at the port.

  my father has survived escaping genocide in our home country, survived bomb blasts that killed his parents and most of his family, has buried his only son, and has never once in my lifetime cried in public.  i have literally never seen him cry, only my mother has, once. he couldn't stop himself from the tears, and he cried with pain.  

he tells the agent to stop, he is told to stop being 'aggressive' (again, he is a 5'7, 115-25 lb cancer patient who has never raised his voice or not cooperated) the agent keeps going, pressing hard on his legs, causing his knees to buckle and he falls to the floor.   the agent stops abruptly, they help him to his feet and offer a chair. my father is white, shaking, and still has tears.  they bring my mother into the room, she had already been roughly patted down herself but is fine.  they wait together for another 20-30 minutes, without any of their belongings or phones.  they agents finally come in and say they can go board their plane, and give a halfhearted apology for 'taking security seriously.'  they take their bags, which  are missing my fathers medication. he asks for it and after another 10-15 minutes or so, he gets it back. by this point the plane has left.  they go to the er to see if port is damaged and for pain medication.

he has now missed a very important scheduled cat scan and consult with his oncology team, and risks getting put out of the treatment plan, as well as possibly getting charged for not calling 24 hours ahead to reschedule, issues with the insurance, etc.  my father is in incredible, needless pain, in a strange city hospital.  port is ok but they want to check him out again before flying.

i would like to know what the best course of action to take to ensure my father can fly comfortably out of this airport and get to his appointments, for one, and secondly to ensure he does not lose his place in the study. if he is kicked out of the program, if we are charged for this appointment or cannot reschedule for a long time (which may not be worthwhile at this stage) can we sue the airline for the cost of that?  can we request they pay for this checkup/stay in the local hospital tomorrow? they have already said the tickets are refunded when my mother called the airline but she has no checked their bank account yet. i am getting all of this second hand from my mother (and third hand from my sister) so i have tried to make a summary of all relevant details that i can go over with her later, so i'd love to know what relevant questions to ask as well.
my family is very quiet, i don't want to do anything to bring any more attention to us (like tweet at the airline) as that would be incredibly upsetting to my father.  i would if that is the only option, however.  i don't know if it's relevant that we are muslim, either, i assume thats why they got so upset when he said it was a medical 'device.'  my father is an absolutely upstanding man who has done so much for the refugee community, other small business owners, and our neighborhood  and worked hard to rebuild and help others after 9/11.  he doesn't deserve to be treated like this, nobody does.  i would love some advice.  apologies for length.
edit- i do not know if this is correct flair, if you want me to change it please advise.",2
"by setting my wifi hotspot to ""bomb detonator"". title says most of it.  i was at a tech conference today.  i like to broadcast random wifi hotspot names to mess with people and after the recent story about the planet fitness  i thought it would go over well as a joke.  i mean, who hasn't seen ""fbi surveillance van"" as a network?

*holy fuck.*  **do not do this!!!**

cops got called.  i got to spend about 45 minutes chatting with them.  they asked a lot of questions.  they had to make sure i'm not a threat.  i cooperated fully.  i have no doubt being a white guy at a nerd gathering probably helped.  i was told i wasn't being charged.  i was, however, told to leave by the venue and not come back.

flash forward two hours and i go to log into my work email on my phone.  huh.  password failed.  huh, again.  ok, let's not fat finger this and lock the account.  pull out the laptop, remote into my work pc.  go to log in.  ""your account has been disabled. contact your systems administrator.""

20 minutes later i get the text message.

*you are being placed on paid administrative leave effective today 5/23 while the agency investigates today's events surrounding you being removed from the <venue>. you are not to complete any work, access agency networks or report to the office during your leave. we will contact you when the investigation is complete.*

tl;dr: immature joke kills career, film at 11.

**edit:**  thank you for the influx of comments and messages.  most of you are right, i am a fucking idiot.  one doesn't come to r/to brag about the good shit they've done.  no matter what you say, i'm trying to keep up.  you're helping me cope.

"being jesus. this happened on halloween. i imagined the evening going down more or less like this: 

1. slip into a white robe.
2. stick on a cactus crown. 
3. moonwalk out of the house as jesus. 
4. remember never to break character. 
5. hop into an uber. 
6. show up to celebrate halloween with friends. 
7. go ham.
8. go home. 
9. go sleep.
10. go for a job interview the next morning.

this is what i would've called a good night. however, after #7, things didn't quite go as planned. here's how shit actually unfolded:

8. got shit-faced.
9. drunk me turned into drunk jesus. 
10. fell into my friend's swimming pool and almost drowned after attempting to walk on water.
11. realized wearing all white, plus water, equals everyone seeing your shriveled up shlong through your tighty whities. 
12. drunk dialed my religious mother in the middle of the night to tell her i'm proof that jesus is fake as fuck and that i'm gay, gay, gay. 
13. unleashed an unholy amount of vomit in the uber driver's car on the way home.
14. missed my job interview the following day after waking up laughably late.
15. realized drunk me set the alarm on my phone two years into the fucking future.

for the record i apologized to my mom. we cool now.

"i recorded a porno over my aunt's wedding video. when i was 14 and 15 i stayed with my aunt cindy for a week while i was working a job. the commute to my job was very long and she lived much closer. it sounds weird to work so young and also to travel for work but it was a family business. 

i couldn't sleep as usual (lifelong insomniac) and i'm awake at 3am flipping through channels on her satellite package. flip flip flip wait a minute. was that a boob? flip back and see real honest to god porn. my aunt had subscribed the playboy channel. #jackpot

it's in the dead of night, no lights on, i've got the volume down as low as possible but this is in the living room and it's a big open area in the middle of the house. so i've got one eye on nasty office sluts get promoted and the other eye keeping watch. i hear someone get up and go into a bathroom. fuck!

i turn the tv off but the satellite is still on. i dig through her entertainment center looking for a blank tape, find one, and slip it into the vcr. i set it to record and then go to bed. i lay awake in bed terrified because if i fall asleep and someone turns on the tv before i get up, they're going to know it was tuned to a dirty channel. 

when the first pinky streaks of morning show in the sky i'm up and in damage control mode. i snatch the tape, change the channel, make sure everything is neat and tidy with the tapes underneath the tv. that's when i find a yellowed label that has fallen off a tape. it says ""cindy and darrel wedding 1985"" no no no no no. look at the ""blank"" tape in my hand, see the faint outline of where a label used to be. they line up perfectly. noooooooooo. 

suddenly i have this smoking gun of a horrible thing i did in my possession. anybody who watched the tape would see 30 seconds of her getting ready with her bridesmaids, cut to half of a porno set in the workplace, then it cuts out later to reveal mid wedding ceremony. what could be more sacrilegious? 

i never watched the tape with any joy, i never told anyone, i just kept it hidden like some awful burden.

"the best thing you can ever do for a box cake mix is use real butter instead of oil, milk instead of water, and add one extra egg.. the difference those 3 small changes make in terms of moisture and texture is amazing. turn that $2 box mix into a $100 professional bakery dupe and no one but you has to know.

edit: since this has blown up beyond anything i could have expected, i feel the need to address a couple of things. there are about 1000 of you screaming ""just make it from scratch!"" and y'all are missing the point. whether you love it or hate it, box cake mix is a thing, and they're extremely popular. millions of people use them all the time. they use them because they're easy, inexpensive, and accessible. there are 8 billion people on this planet and not everyone knows how to bake. not everyone wants to learn, or can even afford to. and that's ok. but for a lot of people, box cake mix is a great jumping off point. all i did was mention a couple of easy things to improve on that that people might not know *because maybe no one had told them before now.* some of y'all are getting awful snobby about cheap cake and it's not a good look. 

second, a bunch of people have suggested other things to jazz up cake mix, from instant pudding and applesauce to coffee and even soda. and you know what? that's fantastic! if you have something that makes baking easier or makes a cake that you think is delicious, then do it! you bake that cake! baking should be enjoyable, and if it's delicious then why does it matter how you get there? everyone has to start somewhere so play around with it, experiment, learn what you like, and what works for you. have fun with it. it's just cake.",8

what is something most people need to hear but no one has the guts to tell people?. ,1
"i(22m) recently discovered my dad (50m) choose me over my former stepmother and half-sister(17f) 6 years ago. don't know how to process this.. i was sexually abused between the ages 9-13 by my stepfather. both he and my mom will be behind bars for many years to come. when i was sent to live with my dad, i was broken. i barely spoke, didn't eat much if at all.  i wasn't mad or angry. i was null of any kind of emotion. basically i was alive but wasn't living. i kept my interactions with everyone to the bare minimum. i was polite but didn't  go out of my way to make conversation with anyone. i was more social with my dad but i kept it to a bare minimum.  i had noting left to say to anyone. it took me 2 years for be me to be able to allow my dad to show any form of parental affection towards me. that's how withdrawn i had become.

dad was my rock throughout the whole thing.  when i experienced night- terrors, i would wake up and either find my dad holding my hand or him holding me.  he drove me to all of my therapist appointments. he made sure i was eating properly. there were days, i would break down for no reason and he would just hold me and tell me that everything will be okay. he literally went above and beyond for me. i hated the city that were living in. because  i had so many bad experiences there, it made living there miserable.

i was so passive, it was scary. my therapist had told my dad that i was stuck in the victim's cycle; i didn't know how to get out. because of this, i was bullied quite a bit. by the time i was 15, i had been to 3 different schools. it got to the point, where my dad pulled me out of public school and enrolled me into online classes. i was always very studious and managed to maintain a 94% average overall but my life lacked any sort of direction. noting would motivate me.

looking back, dad did spoil me but at the time i wasn't aware of it. i was so in my own body that i barley acknowledged my surroundings.   if i asked my dad for a new bed spread, i would get me new one plus new furniture. my phone of 5 years broke and dad got a new one plus a laptop. i was grateful and thanked him. i did share with my half-sister and step-sister at the time. again i was being polite. i didn't have any form of relationship with my former step-mother, step-sister, or half-sister. i barely knew what it was like being a son at the time let alone being a brother.

by the time i was 16, dad had approached me and told me that me and him are moving out. i didn't question it. he had asked me to pack my things and we moved into a rental. i didn't think it was any of my business so i didn't press the issue. a year later, dad had divorced my stepmother. one of dad's business acquaintances offered him a partnership in boston and he took it. we moved and i felt i was ready start my senior year of high-school in a public school. that year was probably the best year of my life. i was coming out of my shell. there was no fear of being judged or being the odd man out. it was if i was like everyone else. i felt ""normal"". i became more social, made a lot of friends, got into sports, clubs, i was going out more. us moving probably saved my life.

because we had moved 9 hours away from my half-sister, she would only come visit us on long weekends, a month during summer break. there was always a form of tension between my dad and half-sister. you could just sense it. it got to the point where as she got older, she stopped coming entirely.

me and dad have always been close. when i had graduated from high-school and gave my valedictorian speech, i could see my dad crying in the crowd. i lived with my dad while i attended college ( i still do for the time being) . ever since i was child, i always wanted to be a doctor. well, i just finished my first year of medical school. honestly, i feel like a normal young adult in society. i have a job, friends, a boyfriend whom i've been with for 4 years. i'm thriving in all aspects of my life.

recently, i got fb message from my half-sister. she was apologizing a lot and i had no clue what she was talking about. turns out, the reason why dad and i moved out from my stepmother's home was because my half-sister told my stepmother what i was watching her change........... yes. she told her mom that i was watching her change.. at the time, i was traumatized of sex. heck i was terrified of any form of intimacy. the kid was envious of what dad was doing for me. she was so envious that she tried to move me out. well i guess her mom and my dad got into a big fight and i'm only going to assume that she did not want me in the house. because we moved out, i think it's safe to assume my dad didn't believe it. how can someone be so cruel? what did i ever do to her? those were the questions that were racing through my head. i didn't even respond. more importantly, dad never let this to get back to me. chances are if i had heard about this when i was 16, that would have been the final nail in the coffin. it also explains the ""tension"" between my dad and half-sister.

this is a lot to take in and i have a new found of respect and love for my dad. he gave up this marriage for me so i could live a normal life.dad is away on a  business trip and won't be back for a few more days. i'm missing him a lot lately.

should i bring it up to him when he returns? also would it be fair for me to just cut my half-sister out of my life entirely? at the same time it's  sad that their relationship is almost non-existent and i almost want to help.

tl;dr: dad choose me over my stepmother and half-sister after my half-sister told a very dangerous lie that could have potentially ruined my life. dad kept it from me for 6 years. should i bring up with him?

edit: i wasn't expecting such a huge response. i just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback. it will take some time but i will read all of them or as much as i can. as i was going through the comments, i found a number of people questioning the integrity of this. this a part of my life. i don't normally like to talk about about this . aside from myself, my dad, and close friends, not many people know about this. the fact the people are saying that it's fake.... i don't what to say. it's not my place to try and convince anyone. believe  me, they're times i wish could convince myself  it's not real but that's not possible. when i wrote this, i wasn't thinking about syntax. it was more just getting this out. people questioning it's integrity based on grammatical errors. forgive me but i wasn't in the mindset to re-read and go over it. 

as for how i became valedictorian and a number of people very curious; i did respond to it in the comments but i'll post it here too. 

""it was very unorthodox how i became valedictorian after attending a real hs for only a year. my overall average was the highest in my graduating class but because i was in online classes for my previous hears, i wasn't eligible at the time. i met with the grade coordinator and had inquired about my chances and her response was the same.

i broke down in front of the coordinator and i told her the truth. being named valedictorian was something i always wanted. to be that would have been my first accomplishment that i would have achieved based on my own merit. yes, their is also the likelihood of getting a free ride to colleges. it wasn't trying to be valedictorian financial reasons. money wasn't a problem (dad did make a lot), it was more this being my first official achievement. this would have helped me self-worth as well.

the girl who was originally going to be valedictorian did meet with me and i told her the truth. she actually talked to the administration to let me valedictorian instead. it something i'll forever be grateful for. that's actually how me and her became friends."". not many people would do that and in hs. 

i'll be posting again. i just need a few days.",7

update #2 following monday's notre dame game:

leading up to monday, we texted like normal, he convinced me to download snapchat, which i had heard about but sort of wrote off as an app where teens and twenty-somethings exchange dirty pictures or where cheating spouses go to because the chats don't stick around. i bit and we had been snapping goofy pictures using the filters, things we bumped into throughout the day, this guy is seriously hilarious. he has this goofball sense of humor and knows how to bring light to any little interaction he comes across.

anyway, so monday rolls around, i'm excited to hangout and nervous all at the same time. i knew he'd have other friends there, all of which i'd never met before and that wasn't helping the nerves. i get over there around 2. he has one friend already there and is expecting more. they trickle in and i'm doing my best to mingle with all the new faces, everyone is super friendly and made me feel like one of the boys. we cut up after the game, played some pool, james had been a bit distant from me that night, but it was understandable that he was manning the grill, and entertaining 8-10 people, he couldn't be everywhere at once. i was going to try to hang out until everyone cleared out so i could talk to him about the kiss, which is exactly what i did. i did my best to not elongate conversations so as to give off the ""the nights winding down"" vibe. after some time everyone left with the exception of one friend who was sleeping off the booze on his couch.

i asked james if we could talk outside. we walk outside and the conversation went something like this: ""i know i kissed you the other day, and i don't know if that was something i should have done, it just sort of felt like the right thing to do in the moment. i've just been thinking about our friendship a lot and i think i may be confused about what we are or where we're heading."" i was absolutely out there now. no turning back, i basically just told him i had developed feelings for him and wanted to know where he stood with me. he didn't even hesitate to respond that he'd been wondering the same thing, why i haven't brought it up before now. obviously i told him i had never been bisexual or gay before, but the texting all the time, the flirting, the kiss! he reassured me our friendship had a no-walls, open door, open communication thing. i could come to him with whatever was on my mind and i just teared up. it wasn't crying, just tearing up but it was so many emotions all at once. i gave him a hug and told him i appreciated that, we sat down and i explained to him how confused i've been these last couple weeks. how this is all new to me, he is such a good listener. i sort of just rattled off everything that's been on my mind regarding us, my confusion in sexuality, my fears. he is an active listener so he had a sentiment or an answer for most of the things i said, they were all comforting. he told me he has feelings for me, that he wasn't sure if he came on too strong. he is not openly gay, he has been bisexual since his teen years and he explained it that as he's gotten older he's hiding it less and cares less of what people think. not all of his friends know, and the ones that do know don't care. a few of the guys from the party knew he was bi.i don't know what i would call the gut feeling i had, but explaining everything, talking about it, airing it out with him was like when you're reading a good book late at night in bed, the story's been confusing, you need answers which you think are coming any minute but flipping the page and a new chapter starting. do you keep reading now or do you save it for tomorrow?  i felt like we had gotten enough out in the air that we are on the same page. i have feelings for him, he has feelings for me, this is new for me, this is nothing new for him. he explained that nothing has to change in our friendship, if we wanted to get physical we could but i shouldn't be pressured. i wanted to kiss him, not like the first one where it was just a slight slip of my tongue and a lip press. i turned to him and put my hand on his knee and leaned in, he gently grabbed the back of my head, we kissed. full on made out for what seemed like ever. it was the most satisfying kiss i've ever had. this where the physical stuff ends for me. (for now, anyway) i'm not ready for anything further than kissing at the moment.

by this time it was nearly 3 in the morning and i had to go. he walked me to my car and we made out a second time before i got in. he told me to get home safe and i did. i texted him to let him know i got home safe and hopped in the shower. i was so emotionally charged that i couldn't get to sleep until around 5 am. i ended up calling out of work tuesday. james and i have plans to hangout again this weekend. he wants to go out for food and a place called topgolf with me and some of his friends from the party, i've never golfed before so this should be interesting.. lol. i'm really looking forward to it and i'm just taking things day to day at this point. i know where we stand and i'm happy.

thank you for all of your support. i have hundreds of inbox messages with encouraging words, people who are confused about their sexuality etc. i just want you all to know that nobody should be afraid to be who they are. you only get one go around this earth and it would be a shame to waste it hiding from what you truly are, based on other peoples accord. i am learning this myself and i'm telling you, it's liberating.

i'll post any other updates here, above this one.  if anything big happens in the meantime i will post it, otherwise the next one will be after the weekend plans.

original post here(https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/csi07o/41m_questioning_sexuality_after_making_a_new/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

lots of you were wanting an update following our hangout on saturday, the trip went well, we spent the entire day out hiking. i was very observant in our interactions, however, i didn't want to be so observant that i overthought anything or misinterpreted anything, so i went with the flow and the vibes were great. we hiked a trail for the better part of the day before stopping to rest before making the trek back down, when i had the opportunity in conversation i mentioned that i had thought about his question about me ever having a male-male experiment and i told him that although i hadn't ever really had one or considered it until that point, it stuck with me and i thought i might be curious to try it. i delivered this passively, just so not to put him on the spot, to my comfort, he received it well, he had some genuine sentiments about how short life is and how things are not always so black and white in terms of how things should be. it felt like the time to make a move but i just didn't do it. we were sitting less than 2 feet apart, looking at each other during this conversation and i just didn't do it. it was a matter of nerves getting the best of me. plus, what if things went south, that'd be a long, awkward walk back to our car, followed by a long ride back to town.

fast forward to the following week, during the week we texted as much as normal, this time i've loosened things up using more emojis, being generally a bit 'flirty' and a bit risque but in a masculine, teasing way (using fitness and physique to goof with him) we got together last night for some drinks at the pub we met at, following that we went back to his house to play the new nba 2k20 demo on ps4, i'll admit i'm not very good at video games and needless to say he beat me pretty bad, but i kept the competitive spirit alive and we had a blast. at the end of the night, around 11p i went to leave, i had been working myself up to kiss him all night, figuring it would be easier with some drinks in me. i went in for our hug, when i pulled back i kept my arms around his back, let him pull back until he was spaced back, he looked me right in the face and sort of smirked ' and i laid it on him, i went right in and kissed him. it was short, i didn't use much tongue, but i pulled back and said ""i guess i can say i've experimented now, right?"" and he sort of chuckled and said ""yeah, i guess you can, man"" he had a sort of confused smile on his face, i had one on mine and it was fireworks in my stomach. i played it cool, i left and texted him when i got home that i was home safe and i thanked him again for a good time. he replied with a similar sentiment and to my surprise didn't ask me about the kiss. he asked if i wanted to come over monday night for the notre dame game and a cook out, i told him i'd love to and i'll bring some ribs to cook.

we have texted as normal today and i can't tell you how excited i am for monday and to see what happens next. i know i waited awhile to update but i felt like i had nothing to update at the time of the hiking trip so i wanted to wait until i had more to report. i will post another update in the comment section here after monday.

thank you so much to everyone who has given me advice and been so supportive. i feel like i'm living my life for the first time at the age of 41.",7
"i secretly changed our bed. me and my wife bought a new bed. a really expensive one, the kind that has separate firmness on each side. we spent hours and hours in the store, where my wife took her time testing and deciding what kind of lower mattress she wanted on her side. beforehand, she had done extensive web research on what kind of bed would give her most happiness in life, and so on. eventually she settled for one with firmness between soft and medium. 
me, i couldn't be bothered with that. i've always liked my beds soft, but the store lady said that with my body composition, i should have a hard mattress. so during a brief brain fart, i chose that. 

next morning, i knew i had f***ed up. the $2000 bed i'd just bought felt awful. even worse, when installing it i'd taken the plastic wrapping off the lower mattresses so i couldn't return them. 

the solution - while my wife was at work i flipped the bed 180 degrees, so that now i have the soft mattress, and she has the concrete slab. there are two additional full width, thick mattresses on top of those, so it's not immediately noticeable. 

this was five years ago. i've slept like a baby ever since. my wife apparently still hasn't noticed, at least she hasn't said anything, and she seems to sleep well. she must never know, though. ",11

"by not removing my girlfriends phone from my bed.. obligatory this didn't happen today, but actually close to a year ago. last october to be exact. 

so backstory. i had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. they just didn't want one thing: us having sex before marriage. they had a lot of reasons. and we were actually planning on it. but we both weren't virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. so of course, temptation got the better of us. okay, end of backstory. 

she was a senior in high school and i had just started college about an hour away. we rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. we would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. everytime she would leave i would get sad, but knew i'd see her again. 

one time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. no answer. she said she was gonna text her. made sense to me. once she said we had, we got right to business. she put her phone on the bed, and i didn't even 

things went on for awhile. lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. lots of fun. and by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. followed by some vibrating. it was her phone ringing, but we couldn't find it. then we found it under my ass. we laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. it was her mom. and within seconds, my girlfriend's expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. 

turns out that she hadn't clicked send on the text she sent out. so her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. and in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone ""daddy"" who was definitely not her dad (the mother's words, not mine).  

she told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. 
my girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. i attempted to calm her down but she wouldn't. so i drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying ""how could she do this"" and other things along those lines. my girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. her mother absolutely said i was not allowed over. 

so we got back to our hometown, i parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn't get caught. she drove home. i called my mom for a surprise ""i'm home for the weekend"". she came and picked me up, and i bawled in her arms. i told her everything. she comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. 

we got back to my house, and i laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. i cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. for the longest time, i thought i never would hear from her again. then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. she said she was coming over and we needed to talk. once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. she said her parents were calm now, and then i was gonna be able to come talk. i was nervous, but i loved her so i did it. 

when i got to their house, i walked in and instantly just started apologizing. i went on and on about how ""we won't do it again"" and how ""we're just stupid teenagers"" and most importantly how i was gonna ""rebuild their trust"". eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. we opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.

at the end of it all, i learned they just loved their daughter and didn't want her getting hurt. but they trusted me. and we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. and everything is cool. sometimes i worry it's still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. 

tldr: my girlfriend and i took phone sex to a whole other level.

"almost 70% of millennials regret buying their homes.. https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/most-millennials-regret-buying-home.html

* disclaimer: small sample size

article hits some core tenets of personal finance when buying a house.  primarily:

1) do not tap retirement accounts to buy a house

2) make sure you account for all costs of home ownership, not just the up front ones

3) and this can be pretty hard, but understand what kind of house will work for you now, and in the future.  sometimes this can only come through going through the process or getting some really good advice from others.

"by ejaculating in front of my girlfriend's mother. now this didn't happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and i am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.

so, a few weeks ago i was at my gf's house, usually the plan when i go is i sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch tv, play games and other stuff. everything was normal, i chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general tv.

this is where the fuck up happens.

after around an hour or so, me and my gf were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.

i'm enjoying this more than i ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. although the risk wasn't huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since i started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.

she starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. literally within less than 30 seconds, i'm already ready to release my load, i try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but i just can't, it feels too good. 

right on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst i'm there in my birthday suit. my girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she's staring at her mum in shock who's staring at both of us in even more shock i release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn't even sucking my dick at the time. not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. her mother didn't even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.

i sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. my girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then i hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.

although me and my gf are still together, i haven't been back or spoken to them since :(

tl;dr - gf was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and i ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit.",4

"if you're working in a technical role (it, engineering, etc), write everything you do down as if it was a user manual. ignore those who say it will be used to replace you. it is far more likely to be used to show management ""you can give me that promotion, as the next guy is all set"".. it's also going to help build skills in communicating things clearly, precisely and in a way anybody can understand. you'll also be amazed how many times writing something out instructionally can lead you to think ""wait, why do we do it like that?!"" - identifying opportunities for improvement.

edit - wow, lots of comments - both positive and negative. for some extra help / elucidation:

-	i found this very helpful when i was starting my career. the biggest part not being the sharing of knowledge, but the act of setting it out ""on paper"" to better see where things need to change, where i didn't know all i could know, and where others may struggle in the future.
-	i am indeed now a director. our company is quite small, but we have had engineers come and go and move on to amazing things, both internally and externally. it's those who communicated and shared knowledge who moved the furthest; i can honestly say my proudest achievement is knowing some of my employees are now in amazing roles in other firms. as a manager, it's a sign that you gave them the right challenge, the opportunity to grow, and the confidence to see they can do more. i'm never sad to see someone go elsewhere if it's because they've found a better opportunity - it means you were a crucial part of them making a success for themselves.
-	most importantly, where i'm from, there are employment laws in place to ensure if someone is fired because they've been forced to ""work themselves out of a job"" then they can sue for constructive dismissal. i know some managers look for ways around this, but generally here it's not a common motif. as such, i do agree that if you're in a country like india, china, usa, where some of these protections and freedoms aren't so readily available, it is better to tread with caution in terms of sharing information. in others, like germany, uk, most of scandinavia, the culture is very different, and going above and beyond to communicate and help others can be well received.

but yes, as with anything - this has been an experience i've personally found valuable and looking from the other side can see why, but always think about how it applies to your situation. i guess as a second tip - if you're working for a company where you feel the management are always trying to find ways to screw you over, maybe it's time to find a new company to work for...",8
"my brother stole almost all of my inheritance and spent it on food and games. what actions should i take against him?. hello. i'm a first-time poster, and i'm also on mobile. i am 19, and i currently live in new york city.

my parents died when my brothers and i were young (eldest was 11, second (the brother in question) was 7, and i was 5). they left money for each of us once we turned 18 to help with college and life expenses. i turned 18 last year, and went through the process of getting the money. it was in march 2019 that i finally got it. it turned out to be a large sum- around $230,000. i decided to split the the money into two accounts- $75,000 into a savings account that no one was suppose to be able to touch, and the rest into my checking account. i wasn't spending much every month, and my grandma has only taken out a few thousand to take care of bills, but that was only $1000-$2000 a month (so a maximum of $12000 by this time).

yesterday, it came to my attention that my entire checking account had been bleed dry- only $200 dollars to my name. i called the bank, and we found several instances of transfers of large sums of money (from a range of $1000 to as much as $25000) over the six month period after i deposited the money. my savings account has also been taken from. i'll admit, i really should have been paying more attention, but i was sure only me and my grandma had access to them and i got no warning from the bank about any of these transfers. we tracked where the transfers were going, and they were going straight into my brother's account. he had somehow gotten ahold of my info. 

when i confronted him, he said he had spent it all and only had about $4000 left. he spent it all- a whole $197,000- on food and on in-game purchases. i know it sound unbelievable, but after looking at his bank statements, it's true. it's just line after line of uber eats, postmates, and game purchases. my grandma wants me to forgive him and let him work to make the money back, but this man just finished community school and has no work expierence. it would take years for him to make that money back on minimum wage. should i call the police and have him arrested? is there any way to get that money back?


edit: okay, i've decided to call the police and sue the bank. i know how to get my hands on bank statements, and i'll record him confessing to the theft. but i don't know how to hire a lawyer. where do i start?

edit #2: okay i just figured out how he got ahold of my account details. my grandma sends him to the store with her atm card sometimes to get money. he memorized her card and pin, found the account shared with me, and took from it.

edit #3: thank you so much everyone for all of your concern and advice. i got a ton of messages and i'm trying to answer them all, sorry if it takes long.

i've managed to convince my grandma (after a long arguement about this potentially ruining his life) to sue the bank for negligence and speak to a lawyer. we're going to see if the court would be willing to send him a mental institution instead of jail. haven't gotten him arrested yet, but i told her if need be, i would call them myself.

i like to clarify my grandmother's intentions on protecting him like this. my mother committed suicide right after my father died, and my grandma felt responsible for not helping her or seeing the depression that had taken hold of her. she explained to me that she knew something was mentally wrong with my brother, and was trying to ""make up"" for ignoring my mother's mental state by shielding him. she had no play in stealing my inheritance, other than giving him her card and pin under the assumption that he was just getting money for her since she can't easily walk to the store and use an atm.

edit #4: so i went to the bank. because he went through my grandmother's account, the bank says we have no claim. no case to sue the bank with. there's nothing i can do to get the money back. i'm ruined financially. all i can do is sue him and put him in jail, but i'm never gonna see that money again. i'd like to thank everyone once again for their help, and i'm sorry if i haven't responded to your messages yet. also, thank those two people who gave this post silver and gold. this will be the last edit i make, hopefully.",2

"neighbor tresspassed on my property and posted online my custom carved wood in my yard as free for taking. it was taken by someone mistakenly thinking it was hers to give away. how can i proceed legall?. long story short, i live in ny. my bfs hobby is to take re-claimed wood custom cut it and make table tops or shelves out of them, selling some tables for $400 or more. i had 3 of these 7ft long oak wood sitting on the side of my house for a month, out to dry in the sun, on planks. those pieces can be sold for $1,200 or more when finished. this lady that lives in the area assumed they were for the trash and publicized the wood online as ""next to a dumpster and going to a landfill"" (my recycling bin was next to this wood, on the back end of my house.) i came home to my wood missing and i found her post online, giving it away for free with my exact home address for all to see. someone unknowingly thinking it was hers to give away snagged them. i contacted the guy, and got it back. i then wrote her a message showing her a screenshot of the ny state government property lines website of my properties boarder which she clearly crossed over to take the photo of the wood on my property. i told her to never do that again and mind her own business. her response was ""i am quite too busy to read all this, either way it was a mistake. good luck out there in this shitty world, it sure is a bear."" after that passive aggressive bullshit i went to the police. i filed for tresspassing. the cop said i could get her for possible larceny. idk how that wouldnwork if she didnt take it herself. i'm just wondering... how far can i push this? i am now completely uncomfortable with doing future projects in my own yard and the entire town i live in now knows my exact address attached to my name because of this lady. the cops said they would go to her home and ask her side of the story... i have pictures of her post, pictures of my property line and screenshots of many people i didnt know very well, asking me if her post was in fact the wood on my property that i had posted on my own fb that i was in search for, linking my exact name to that exact address. i work as a bartender in town, where i have many strange men i dont want knowing where i live. she posted it to my towns facebook page. maybe if she was more kind i would have let bygons be bygons but now, i'm thinking ""the world sure can be a bear""",2

"my faith in humanity isn't restored when i see something like the bullied girl with a disability wins homecoming queen. call me cynical but it really feels like an ego boost for the people who voted for her. disabled people and bullied people aren't your charity case.. you see it all over social media and the news, headlines that read, ""there are still good people in this world. she was bullied for her disability but her classmates voted her for prom queen."" or ""star basketball players stands up for his bullied classmate"". sure it seems sweet at first but when i think about it all i can see is someone doing something ""nice"" for their own personal gain. when these stories make the news, who usually gets the most publicity? who gets the interviews and good press? why, the people who did the ""good deed"" of course. most of the time it seems like they don't give a damn about the person who they did something ""nice"" for, instead it's about ""look what we did! we are so nice! we are so good hearted!"" it's all about making themselves feel better when they go to sleep at night, it's almost never about the person it should be about. it's not sweet and heartwarming, it's almost sort of heartbreaking because i've seen instances where people will do ""nice things"" for someone because they take pity on the person and it makes them look good in the eyes of others, but go right back to treating that same person like shit as soon as nobody else is paying attention. it was never about being nice and genuine, it was all a big ego boost. if you want to do something nice do it when nobody's looking and don't accept any congratulations for your good deed.

eta: like i said in a reply to a commenter, sure its a ""nice thing to do"" and in some cases it makes the disabled person feel good and it's a nice gesture all around, but disabled people aren't mindless angel pets. they have brains and lots of them don't like to feel pitied or patronized. especially when that pity is superficial and the people who give her those pity votes will go right back to ignoring or bullying the disabled person. i'm not saying ""don't ever be nice because people could misconstrue your motives"" i am saying, however, that you should be mindful of your actions and be careful not to make people feel patronized and pitied. also if you're gonna do something nice for someone make sure you're being genuine be consistent with your actions towards someone. don't be nice one day and then cruel the next. i know that all good deeds are a little selfish and that's not my main issue here. the motive isn't the issue either, it's the fact that people see others who happen to have a disability as nothing more than a sad little animal to feel sorry for. instead of mistreating someone, doing one ""nice"" thing either because you feel sorry for them or you want wholesomeness clout or both, and then going right back to treating that person like shit; you could be genuine in the first place and treat them like any other human being and maybe even develop a true friendship with them. my issue is the publicity and praise people get for being insincere and inconsistent. i really don't give that much of a shit about ""prom queen"" or shit like that anyway, i'm using it as an example. i'm almost 20 years old and when i was younger i never ran for those positions anyhow. another example could be, like people in the comments said, giving a homeless guy $90 and filming it to post on youtube. instead of patronizing the guy, maybe hire him to help you wash your car or do some yard work and then pay him for his labor. that way he won't feel pitiful and have such low self esteem. make him feel like he's not a helpless invalid.",6
"by masturbating in front of my entire family. this happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. 

stress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which i was extremely anxious about. all together, i was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager i am, i often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. 

so, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, i lay down in my living room with my family, watching tv. i dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since i had done next to no study at the time). 

not really caring to face the problems that troubled me, i decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. 

and so off i went. except i forgot one thing.

i was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.

somehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that i was not in fact sitting with my family by our tv, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. 

i don't really understand how or why it happened. a few seconds in and i began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.

i snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment i put myself in. 

i'm not going to talk about what happened next, as i don't want to relive the next few moments.

my father is just disappointed. he hasn't talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.

my mother believes that we should ""embrace my sexuality"", and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as i write this. 

and i'm just studying my ass off, poring through books, it's a good excuse to be alone. i find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe i was just dreaming while i was gassed up. 

but it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.

"update: i just recieved a demand letter from enterprise rent-a-car stating that if i do not return their rental car, i will be charged with embezzlement and grand theft auto. i never rented a car from them. (san jose, california). thank you to everyone for the advice. i'm also a she by the way (many of you thought i was a dude lol), but on to the update:  
  
  
  
  

after my initial post, i saw that many of you advised for me to call the manager and demand information from her because enterprise is the one at fault and i shouldn't have to go to the police for their mistake. so i did exactly this, and she told me that id i want her to give me more info, i would need to file a police report within 24 hours and email it to her as evidence that i am not the person who rented the car.  if not, she would report me for embezzlement and grand theft to the sacramento police. upon hearing this, i decided to file a report immediately online with the san jose police department. i know many of you said i shouldn't because its not my fault but after she told me the consequences, i did not want to take any chances where i could end up with a warrant on my head.  i thought that if anything, filing this report would also prove my innocence if the police actually did come knocking on my door.  after filing it, i emailed her the copy and she responded the next day, saying that she recieved it and to give her a call.  when i spoke to her over the phone this time, she said that i was in the clear and finally gave me information about what had happened:  
  
  
  
  

on may 29, a woman claiming to be me had come in to rent out a black cadillac. she showed the representative ""her"" drivers license that had my information on it, and paid for the car rental upfront with cash. (i thought that you need a credit card to do this but apparently you can just use cash) the manager also says that she has video surveillance of the woman which she will turn into the sacramento police later that afternoon. the following morning, she emailed me the number of her report which she filed as fraud, and said that the police opened up an investigation which she will keep me updated on.  at this point, i was relieved to be in the clear yet also pissed that some woman is out there impersonating me. i then started contemplatig about taking a 3 hour drive to sacramento see who the hell this woman is. however, turns out i didn't have to because 2 hours later...  
  
  
  
the san jose police did show up knocking on my front door. ( 2 policemen and 2 chp officers) before opening it, the first thing i did was grab the copy of the police report i printed because i seriously thought that they were going to arrest me  (2 squad cars, 4 officers, and 1 me). when i open the door,  the first thing they ask me is if name of woman i do not know lives at my home? i tell them no, and that i have no idea who that is,  then they ask if i am alymg and i tell them that i am. they then begin to inform me about a car accident that happened in the nearby town of fremont that morning. the accident was a hit and run, with the driver fleeing the scene but she dropped her drivers license which they found on the floor. they then show the license to me and it's an exact replica of my drivers license, and i ask them how this is possible if i have my license in my wallet? they then tell me to go grab it and after comparing the two side by side, one of them tells the others that the one they have is a fake. (the black strip on theirs is chipping but mine isn't... it's not supposed to chip) i then ask them if the driver  was the woman who stole the car from enterprise, and they ask me to ellaborate which is when i hand them my report. i explain what happened which prompts them to give me more details about the accident, and they tell me that the woman was driving a stolen car and crashed into another vehicle, but she fled the scene in the black cadillac from enterprise.  so basically, the rental car was used as the ""getaway car"" and was identified by the witnesses in the other vehicle. i told the officers that i have the plate number of the vehicle in the demand letter, and the that info down as well. i then asked them who is the name of the woman i do not know and they told me that she is the who stole the car. however, i'm not sure how they know that (fingerprints maybe) but they did show me her mugshot, and we do not look a-like at all. idk how the hell she was able to rent the car in the first place but whoever rented it to her probably didn't even check for a comparison. but after this, the police then thanked me and told me that they'll call me when there's an update on the case.  
  
  
   
  
  
  

i do have her name now though, and after doing a google search i found her facebook and other social media accounts. i'm very tempted to message her but i've decided to leave this to the police because i have no idea who this bitch is, and don't know if she's dangerous (she might be gang affiliated or something  and she does know where i live) however, i do hope that they catch this bitch and will update you all when that happens.

"i am a hotel breakfast bandit.. it started after reading about this guy in georgia(https://www.wrcbtv.com/story/39049814/dalton-police-searching-for-breakfast-bandit) who was apparently stealing food from multiple hotels. out of pure curiosity and the desire to do something ""bad"", i decided to try it out for myself.

i live in a pretty big city (think top 10 in the u.s.) so there are no shortage of hotels around. once a week or so to ""treat myself"", i'll target a hotel. i'll walk in confidently pretending i'm a guest, sometimes i'll even make up small talk with the front desk staff like *hey just so i know, what time is check-out?*. i'll hang out in the nearby bathroom for 5 minutes surfing my phone. then i'll come out to the breakfast station and absolutely demolish the waffles, eggs, muffins, pancakes, fruits, etc.

my city has lots of medium-rated hotels with good breakfasts. the best ones have been:

- embassy suites

- holiday inn express

- hampton inn

- fairfield inn

- springhill inn and suites

- best western

- residence inn

all of these are within 10 minutes driving distance. if i rotate through them all on a weekly basis, i only really hit up each of them 5-6 times a year. spread out enough that the staff doesn't remember me; and of course there's lots of staff turnover each year so my chances of being caught are minimal.

i feel kind of bad about this. but the thrill is intense and it's a nice free hot breakfast. hard to stop.",11

"i give overweight customers smaller bakery items. i work in a very popular bakery. my jobs include serving customers by packaging what they want into boxes, stocking the showcase with pastries, cakes, cookies, etc, and occasionally helping in the kitchen.

like any other bakery that does everything by hand, it's not easy to make everything a uniform shape and size for each product. when a customer comes in who is very obese or overweight, i low-key dig around for the smallest of the item that they want, such as the smallest cookies, fritter or donut. in my head i'm thinking, ""they don't need this, they're sick and could use a little less calories. they shouldn't be in here, i'll help them out by giving them a little less"". when really it isn't my responsibility and if they want something sweet that may not be very good for their already bad condition..then whatever i shouldn't hinder something that's going to make them very happy.

i can't say that i will likely stop doing it after confessing..i just still feel like if i don't try and do the little thing to help them, who will?",11

"my(25m) girlfriend(22f) wants to share our incomes, thing is, i make roughly 7 times as much, advice please. so here is the deal, me and my girlfriend have been together for a little under 3 years and have been living together for a few months. my girlfriend takes college classes and works part time, i finished college 2 years ago, quickly got hired by the company i did my internship at and within a year i got a promotion and a large payraise and i am now making roughly 150k a year, while she makes 20k a year.

now she moved in with me a few months ago in to the place i bought so i pay nearly all costs, mortgage, electricity, water etc, the only things she pays herself are non essentials like spotify, phone bill, netflix and so forth.

now recently we got in to a huge fight where she demanded we pool our money together and spend what is left after essential costs together, where as currently i pay basically every essential and my own shit, use a bit to enjoy myself and put the rest in to my savings.

now she seems to be jealous i got a lot more to spend, which is not really true since after monthly costs i put the majority in my savings account.

in my eyes she already gets an easy ride and honestly she is just shit with the money she does have, she spends it on crap like stupidly expensive clothes and then complains she is broke at the end of the month.

so what do i do, i hate to put money in the way of our relationship but if i am honest i am questioning my relationship as there is no way i am going to let her essentially spend my salary on stupid shit.

edit: so, there are so many comments i am having a hard time keeping up with it. if i don't respond, know that i am trying to at least read your comment. but currently when i read and respond to 1 comment i get 10 more! haha. i just want to thank everyone for their responses from the ones who yell gold digger to the ones who take a middle ground approach... even those who yell about mgow or something and those who are if the opinion i need to give her all my money because of a pink tax or something, all advice is appreciated and gives me an extra light to view this in! i had not expected my post to blow up like this though hahaha.",7
"my parents chose their new families over me so i moved in with my aunt. now they want back in. but i hate them. hi.

so i 16. moved in with my aunt at 15 because my parents remarried and had new families.

my father married his mistress who allready had a son and now they have a baby daughter. my mom remarried my step dad and they had my half sister.

after all that i became a secondary character in their life and they looked forward to ship me off to the other home so they could pretend that i didn't exist and play happy family.

after a year i became fed up and started sleeping over more and more at other houses and when home i would never interact with anyone. both my parents took that as a rebellious phase and would fight with me all the time. i wasn't a bad kid or a trouble make but soon i was labeled as the black sheep of the family. every interaction with my parents became a lecture about my attitude problem and how well the other kids behaved. i was just so fed up that i packedy shit and disappeared for a few days. i took a bus and went mia for 4 days. ofcourse the police was called and when i appeared again i hit another lecture.

we got in a screaming match were they called me a disappointment and i told them i hated them. i called my aunt crying and she came to fetch me.

in the car i could hear how she was tearing my parents a new one.

neither of them tried to convince me of coming back home. we informed the respective authorities about my changed living condition and my aunt is my current guardian.

my parents ways half assed our contact. appearing only when it was convinient sometimes giving me money etc. recently they tried to build more contact up but i was not interested.

i won a story writing contest and didn't tell them nor did i invite them to the celebration. and on the website where you can read my story the thanks goes to my aunt for loving me unconditionally. i didn't invite my parents to my sweet 16 party. basically i have cut them out of my life.

i am not interested in their life's or families or anything.

mom tried to meet up for my birthday but we didn't. she got upset and called me crying and..... i just didn't care. it was like listening to a tv character cry. it wasn't important she isn't important to me anymore.

dad called me and said he was worried about me and how my reaction is not healthy and again i didn't care.

as far as i am concerned my aunt is my only parent. she encourages that i build up my relationship to my parents again but doesn't force me.

anyway yesterday my parents pulled me out of school and invited me to eat at our old favorite place. mom had tears in her eyes and even dad seemed hurt. they tried apologizing for their behavior and pleaded with me to come back and i just said no and left. i still resent them for choosing a new life over me. but i don't know if i am being a pretty asshole or what to do now. i don't want them in my life but would i be making the right choice? ""idk

edit : because people think o just made it up and i am a moody teen

you know when you are at a friend's house where their parents don't particularly like you and you feel tense all the time and you feel like you shouldn't be there? that was the feeling i constantly had at their houses.

i know that my stepfather doesn't like me that much. my parents would both fight about who keeps me longer. but not in the sense ""i want to have her longer"" but ""i took her last weekend! it's your turn"".

also planing fun activities for the day after i leave. my father and his wife would often schedule visits to the parks or bigger trips spesifically to the weeks my mother had me and my mother and her husband would leave me alone at home so they could go out with the baby.

every chance they got they would ship me of to grandma's or my aunts place with some excuse and then do family stuff.

also when you went trough the houses there were barley any pictures of me. they had big ass portaits of my siblings and them together but almost none of mine.

they shipped me off to my grandma's and grandpa's for a whole summer and only called twice. 

when there are family functions i am often excludes. e.g my dad had a family bbq and didn't invite me 

they forgot my birthday on more than one occasion and when they remembered they got me a 10 dollar starbucks gift card even when they know i don't like starbucks. 

so no they never straight up said it but they didn't hide it either.",7
"for exposing my sister's lies about why she wanted a house keeper?. my sister is a stay at home wife, no kids for now. her and her husband had been discussing getting a house keeper to help clean the windows and bathrooms since she said it took a long time.  i was visiting last weekend and she brought it up to me and seemed very happy. out of pure curiosity, and since i clean my house by myself being unwed, i asked her how long it took to do that since it didnt take me too long. she got defensive and upset, which i wasn't expecting. she said i should try cleaning her two bathrooms(toilets and showers), and windows so i can see how long it takes her if i want to know so badly. so, i did. i got out the scrubbing bubbles, the toilet and shower brush. sprayed down the shower and toilets with it. then went and sprayed and cleaned the windows. went back scrubbed the toilets and showers. about half an hour later i was done. i guess she made it seem like to her husband that it took her hours to do what i did in half an hour.  she once again got very mad, started yelling until she let out that ""fine i lied about how long it takes because i hate cleaning those!"" to no surprise her husband got mad then. he said if she had been honest about just not wanting to clean those that would have been fine but the fact that she lied about it gave him pause and he said he w as gonna re-think hiring someone if she thinks she can lie to get what she wants.

"update this man/kid keeps flying a drone over my house with eggs attached to it that gets released on my property, i have a specific question regarding something i want to do and need to know the legal aspect to it.. i would like to thank you guys for the help and all the creative ideas you have proposed in the original thread(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5kkp7e/this_mankid_keeps_flying_a_drone_over_my_house/). sorry for not updating you right away as i was really impacted by the death of a very close person in my family.

so here's what happened. i liked one of the comments here where it said to see if there is anyone who fly drones as a hobby willing to use his drone for me for a thousand dollar instead of me paying for a whole new drone, figured just like you guys said it would make someone's day to fly a drone as a hobby and also get paid. so i hired a guy which i'll call him frank.

after waiting for 3 days at my house every morning the drone finally flew to us but apparently when the other kid saw the other drone take off he went crazy and tried to hit it or take it down, which he did, which resulted in the kid's drone and frank's drone both to go down broken on the ground. 

a few minutes later this kid came running to the house (whom i recognized lives a couple of blocks away) and started whining about how we flew our drone in his way and crashed it bla bla bla. we went and spoke to his dad and showed him all the footage and explained all the shit his son has caused. shockingly he was completely understanding. he told me he would put me through one of his lawyers so that they would offer both frank and i a settlement if i agree not to sue. i called my lawyer and we all met a week later and he reimbursed frank for his drone plus way more money that i would've ever paid him. he also wrote me a check for what his son has caused under the condition that i wont pursue any legal action.

it was a happy ending and i was quite shocked of his father's reaction and his willingness to pay for everything his son has caused, but i must admit that i feel sad knowing that his dad is definitely the one enabling him to do so. never have i felt his dad was mad about anything his son did. while we were there discussing what happened his dad received a phone call and then shortly after ending it he started telling his son what the other party was saying and they both started making jokes about the caller! so the whole thing made me feel that his dad was like ""mehhh just another day, my son caused damage and i'll just have to pay those people here for this to go all away"".",2
"a man is walking the las vegas strip, and runs into the most beautiful women he has ever met. nsfw. he starts talking to her, and to his luck he finds out she is a prostitute. so, he asks her.

""how much for a hand-job?""

""5,000$?? you must be nuts, no way."" 

""walk with me."" she replies. he agrees and they walk for a moment to end up in front of a restaurant. ""you see this restaurant? i own this restaurant because men pay me 5,000$ for hand jobs.""

he ponders for a moment. ""damn, they must be pretty good then. alright."" he brings her back to his hotel room. gets the hand job, and as advertised; it is the best hand job he has ever had. after he finishes, he realizes how perfect she is and asks. ""okay, that was awesome. how much for a blow job?""

""15,000$"" she replies.

""come to the window."" they walk to the window and she begins to point. ""you see those three casinos? i own those casinos because men pay me 15,000$ for blow jobs.""

"for cancelling on a group of very out of shape women that hired me to train/guide their hikes?. first up please know i am trying my best to be kind in my wording. i run a small operation where i guide groups or help train them to be able to hike. i have served all kinds of clients.

i got an inquiry for a group called ""womens+ adventures"" and because it was during pride month, i thought maybe it was an lgbtq+ group. i chatted with the head of the group, collected the information (hiking levels, what have they done before, etc), and we exchanged money and i started the training plan.

the group wanted to work up to ""a 14er"" which if you do them, you know there's all kinds. going off what everyone reported, i decided gray's peak. one of the easiest and most rewarding because of the beautiful valley it's in.

when i arrived for our first group hike, i learned ""womens+"" meant plus-sized women rather than lgbtq+. no issue, their forms all said they were in good condition to start.  

the first hike was... awful. it was a short 4 miles round trip, with 750ft elevation gain. several of them ignored my list of suggestions for attire, footwear, supplies, etc. when we got started hiking, it was very slow. one woman was upset we were starting with something so strenuous and asked for a break every 1/2 mile. one ate all of her snacks after the first break. lots of complaints of it being too hard, too long, etc. 

after we got back (6 hours later) i pulled the head aside and asked if everyone was truthful on their abilities forms. she insisted it was all true and then got annoyed that i didn't believe them. when i suggested we aim for a smaller goal, she was obviously very offended. i gave them all ""homework"" which was to make sure to take a brisk 1 hour walk every day to prepare for the next hike. several of them laughed at me incredulously.

2nd hike went even worse. i had an 8-week plan in place, and it was obvious to me this wasn't going to work. so i called the head and told her that i thought it was best if i refund the cost pro-rated from the two hikes we did. well, she threw a huge tantrum and called me all kinds of names, and insinuated that i am fatphobic, i'm mocking them, etc.

please, please keep in mind that i have helped train several overweight people, including a pair of women in their 60s who send me pictures all the time of their great adventures. i consider myself to be very patient. one of them said they thought we would start with something like a walk in a local park to get us ready to hike in a few weeks. simply put, they weren't realistic with their expectations. 

i refunded the money and ended contact only to find my social media bombarded by hate from all kinds of people. you can guess what i was called. i felt awful and in talking over this with people, several told me i was an asshole for not powering through, that i should have given them three chances, that i should have had more patience and understanding that not everyone is a natural athlete.

"by flashing my breasts...not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam for a new job.. i've been in the very early stages of interviewing at this company for about three weeks now. ""early stages"" feels like i joke because i've had at least three interviews with their recruiter so far.

as part of the hiring process for company x, you have to meet with the recruiter, take a personality test, take a logical reasoning test, interview with the hiring manager, complete a case study, present to a panel, and then individually interview with the whole team. it's a lot. i also think this it's a bit ridiculous, but i *really* hate my job. what can you do?

anyway, i pass the early interview parts with my recruiter, and he informs me i'm ready for the next step: the personality and logical reasoning tests. to ensure i'm not cheating on these tests, and because they don't want me to come in for a proctored test, i have to use their software to record myself taking the exam from my computer's camera.

now, when i'm not spending my time applying for new jobs, i'm working from home for my current job. because i wfh, i'm not always the most presentable. we're talking sweats 100% of the time and showers only 45% of the time. i look bummy. i'm a bummy girl who works from home. to be clear though, i'm not unhygienic or filthy, just bummy.

anyway. i didn't take this into consideration when i opened up my computer for these tests. i *really* didn't take it into consideration when i opened up the program to begin the tests. i only took it into consideration when staring back at me on the screen was my greasy, messy bun and  my four-sizes-too-big, holey sweatshirt.

and then...because apparently i have no shame??? i decided to watch myself *sniff* the neck of my sweatshirt to even see if it's clean (it wasn't). this was a super sobering moment, guys.

i really wanted to put on a semi-good impression here. so, i stood up from my workspace (aka my bed) to make myself a little more presentable. while getting up, i haphazardly moved my computer (which had been on my lap) off to the side with the screen facing the open part of my room. i took off my super-holey sweatshirt to put on something a little nicer. that's when i realized i wasn't wearing a bra (why would i be. i'm wfh, remember?), and the shirt i'd planned to quickly throw on wouldn't work without one. i started rummaging around in my dresser for a bra. i pull one out, put it on. dig through my closet for that single shirt i was looking for. find it, put it on. bam. ready.

i flopped back down on my bed to take the exam (looking at least 67% better). getting myself all situated, i went to push record to start the exam.

there was no record button.

instead, there was a red ""light"" in the corner and a timer counting up. it read something like 00:09:04.

it had been recording the entire time. the whole time.

me cringing at my reflection? recorded. me smelling my sweatshirt? recorded. me dickin' around my room with my titties out? *recorded.*

i had been topless for a solid six minutes of that 00:09:04 time. for an eternally-long six minutes, my titties had been out, flopping around, being recorded.

i can *only* imagine what my face looked like on that camera when i realized. i definitely whisper-spoke  ""*fuck,""* and stared at the red little light for a while. maybe a blacked out? i don't know. what i did know in that moment, was that i was royally fucked. the recorded video submitted when you closed the window. there was nothing i could do.

and then...because i'm a dumbass, guys. i went ahead and *finished* the tests and submitted it all.

so. that's it. there you have it. i might now have nudes on the internet. i might get my recruiter fired for nsfw videos. or, who knows? i might get the job.

tl;dr by not realizing i was being recorded on an interview exam while changing clothes. i may have exposed my breasts to my recruiter and perhaps an entire hr department.

as you can guess from the title, it's not a very happy story. buckle up, this'll be a long ride. tldr at the bottom.

&#x200b;

my parents broke up very early, i grew up with my mom. my dad wasn't really present throughout my childhood. my mother has had a drinking problem for as long as i can remember. she had a rough upbringing and could only vent her frustration when she was drunk. the way things went down was always the same.

around once a month she comes home late, waking me in the middle of the night. from then on it's a shitshow. she starts yelling, spitting at me, beating me. smears her snot in my face or on my bedsheets and makes me sleep in there. one second she yells in my face that she hates me, that my father and grandma hate me, that it's all my fault and in the next second she starts crying and says that she loves me, emotional rollercoaster. this always goes on for the whole night. i don't remember too much but ironically the most prominent memories are the ones from when i was very young, maybe around 5 or something. one night i had to stand facing the wall the whole night while she screamed at me. i was so tired since i was just a little kid but everytime i tried to sit down she would hit me. sometimes i had to do squats while pulling at my ears, making me look really stupid. apart from the fact that it was humiliating, she made me do them until i collapsed from the pain, then she shouted at me to continue.

a weird thing she did was she frequently pretended to choke to death in the middle of a rant. she then lay there motionless for 10 minutes straight. as a 5 year old, i was completely in panic and had no idea what to do. i tried to wake her up but she didn't respond at all until she suddenly jerked up and resumed shouting at and hitting me for ""not helping her"". luckily she stopped pulling that one once she saw that i got too used to it.

as i got older she got more and more violent, but the only times i was really scared for my life was when she got the kitchen knife while fighting with her (now ex) fiancee. luckily no one was ever stabbed. i could go on and on but you get the idea. i never got any help because i was so used to all this stuff. and ofc my mother told me to never tell anyone. whenever i brought her bahaviour up in the next morning she claimed that she couldn't remember, said that i'm overexaggerating things, or outright claimed i was making stuff up. sometimes she apologized ""i will never do it again, honey"". i stopped listening after a while.

school was pretty shit aswell. i had no social skills because i preferred to play video games all day. i was a weird and misbehaving kid, so i was bullied a lot. also i was too afraid to stand up for myself, because i only knew punishment. the fact that we often moved didn't help much. all in all i went to 10 different elementary schools across 4 different countries. poland was especially shit. not the country, you polish folk are nice people :) but living with this rich alcoholic dude whom my mother constantly fought with was. thank god that episode only lasted a few months.

anyway, i digress. unsurprisingly i became depressed at some point and have been ever since. don't know when exactly, i think it was somewhere around 10 years old. this torture went on for many years.

&#x200b;

then it happened.

she came home drunk one morning morning while i was getting ready for school. she didn't get much of a reaction out of me these days and didn't seem to like it. as mentioned in the title i was 15 years old at that time and getting physically stronger than her and i was used to the shouting. also i was basically dead inside. i was completely nonchalant when she started her rant. then she said something about my ex gf. it wasn't really all that bad but it was a weak spot for me since she recently broke up with me, it was my first relationship and i was the one who fucked it up. it was the last straw. all these fucking years of constant abuse and neglect unloaded themselves in one moment.

humans can be animals.

it was like watching a movie from a 3rd person perspective. i had no control whatsoever. i screamed while grabbing her throat and squeezing with all i had. i somehow strangled her across my whole room onto the bed. my big and scary mother whom i was always afraid of wasn't able to fight back against my rage. not one bit. now thinking back she even looked kinda scared. so she was on her back on my bed and i was standing above her, squeezing her throat. i have no idea how long that went on, maybe a few seconds, maybe half a minute. everything felt so surreal. at some point my brain kicks in: ""do you really want to do that?"" i get ahold of myself and i let go of her. fucking mistake.

she instantly grabs a chair and starts swinging at me full force. i mean yeah, i technically tried to kill her but now i just want to get out of this alive. i block it and it fucks up my arm. then she fucking bites me in the very same arm jesus fucking christ that hurt. the bite later swole to the size of a ping pong ball. anyway i manage to get the hell out of that appartement but now i run the risk of freezing to death since we had winter and i'm wounded with nothing on me but my pyjamas. i encounter a neighbour and ask him to call the cops. i tell them what happened (leaving out the strangling part) and after they see my wounds they inform my mother that i'm being taken into care. my mom makes a pathetic attempt of trying to put on an act but snaps halfway through and bites an officer, gets wrestled down and arrested on the spot (it was honestly hilarious in hindsight, she played the victim and called me a traitor for calling the cops on her) but got out later on. she had to pay a huge fine though for attacking an officer.

&#x200b;

i moved out into government care. it was honestly cool. by the end of age 15, i had my own appartement for free rent, 400€ per month to do with whatever the hell i want and social workers that were pretty decent people (kudos to german cps). however shit caught up with me, my depression worsened badly, i started to drink a lot and later that year i tried to drown myself. that was rock bottom for me.

i've had bad phases since then, there were nights where i wanted to die, nights where i wanted to pay my mother a visit and get my revenge and nights where i didn't want anything at all. however all in all life's been gradually improving for me. slowly but steadily. the older i got, the more self-aware i became about my behaviour so i stopped getting bullied. also i learned to stand up for myself, that was helpful. however i still ended up quitting school at some point. i realized i can't force myself to do something i despise for even a second. i just stood up in the middle of class and went ""fuck it"". after that i tried a bunch of different jobs but none of them worked for me. however i found my true passion. i love making music, and i'm currently putting all my energy into becoming a successful musician. i no longer care if i might fail, it's really liberating! my relationship with my mother has been improving steadily aswell. boy it was hard at first, and i made sure to let her know how much i hated her for what she did, but she finally, truly admitted her mistakes and quit drinking. it was easier after that. i could start expressing and letting go of my hatred in a healthy way. she really made an effort to better herself. i also apologised for what i did that day and she forgave me.

i wish i could tell you a happy ending to that part of the story but sadly my mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia two years ago. the stress of coming to terms with what she did and the loneliness probably broke her. sometimes i think about what i could have done differently. she knows that i still haven't forgiven her and am still suffering every day because of what happened. but i can't change that. i told her it needs time. it's been only six years since the day police took me. she's back in her home country now with her family, they're taking care of her. thank god for that. the last two years were a huge burden. at one point she was so thin that you could see the shape of her skull, all while having that giddy delusional smile on her face. horrifying.

well, there it is. the story of how i tried to kill my mother. i apologise for the swearing, i got a bit emotional while writing this. granted, a lot of bad stuff happened in the past but it made me the way i am today, and i'm glad for that. i learned many things and i wouldn't trade that for the world.

people become who they are based on circumstances, but it is always in our power to change our fate. don't hate them, no matter what they do to you. cruel people are often hurting inside. instead encourage them to be the best they can be!

life's too short to be unhappy. strive towards your goals and never settle for less! it could always be your last day on earth, you literally have nothing to lose!

life's definitely not fair. cherish what you've been given and make the best of it. suicide will prevent you from ever becoming happy.

however i realize i'm still only 21 years old and have a lot to learn. i plan on doing so. i don't want to live a life full of hatred and regret, i want to be able to love and trust somebody again. i want to get married, have atleast 3 children, become a successful musician, travel the world, stuff like that. just be happy. i know i'll get there, one day at a time.

*tl;dr - i was constantly abused by my mother and bullied in school since my early childhood and snapped one day, almost strangling my mother to death. police took me in and after a while things got gradually better between us. i've pretty much made up with her. now i try to live my life as best as i can.*

&#x200b;

phew, i did it! it feels like i wrote up an entire novel. contrary to my expectations, i actually feel better now! if anyone made it 'til here, thank you for reading! :)

&#x200b;

edit: i'm waking up this morning and jesus christ this blew up... i've read some comments and want to thank you guys so much for your kind words!! they mean a lot to me! i'll try to answer some comments later if there are any quesions.

also people have been asking me about my music. i prefer not to disclose anything here, i don't want to turn this into an advertisement for my songs. :)


editedit: i'm at a loss for words, man. just thank you all so much for your kind words, even those of you who had critical things to say! it's just surreal. these comments are coming in faster than i can reply but there is something i wanted to adress, since it popped up a few times.

i understand that a lot of emotions can be stirred up by such a delicate topic, especially if you experienced abuse yourselves. maybe it's partly my fault, because i focused too much on the negative aspects of our relationship. if so, then i apologize.

but please, if you can, don't write hateful comments about my mother. some things did go very wrong, yes. but she also did the best she could in raising me. there was always food on the table, she tried showing affection in her own way, she cared for my interests and education etc. and i firmly believe that she has always loved me. she just couldn't always express it, as she's as much a victim of abuse as i am. that's why it hurts me seeing comments like ""you should have killed her"" we have to be better than that! i know we can!

so i just want to make it clear that even after what happened i love her. after all, she is my mom.",11
"my parents have refused for years to do anything about my sister and now she has broken my nose. i am sick of this shit (florida). for clarity we're both minors. i'm 16 and my demonic sister is 15. she has never been right since we were little kids. always violent. she bashed me in the head with a metal pipe when i was 5 because i wouldn't let her ride my bike. all of my life i've been putting up with this shit and i have had enough.

she hits me, breaks my things, literally stabbed me last year, stole the keys to my car and banged it up twice this year. my parents wont do anything about it. she's already in alternative school for stalking another girl in her class. i really don't know what is wrong with her. she's not slow or anything like that before she got kicked out of regular school she was in the gifted program. my parents think she's like this misunderstood genius or whatever. they refuse to involve cops because it's a ""family issue"". which brings us to today. my parents force me to let her tag along with me and my friends because honestly she doesn't have any except for this delinquent at the alternative school she is supposedly dating. whatever, not important.

anyway, i was hanging out with my friends today and of course the demon was with us. we decided to go to the dollar tree to get some snacks. demon didn't buy anything. as we left the store i could hear something in her bag like a rattling noise. i confronted her and this little beezy stole a bunch of cough pills! i don't know why. don't they make meth out of those or something? so i told her i was going to call mom. i pulled out my phone right there and she fucking punched me in the face! i was really angry she did that in front of my friends and no way was i going to let her embarrass me so we started fighting. i took her down and had her pinned on the ground. that's what you have to do pin her and let her tire herself because she will not stop otherwise. i had her arms pinned and she started flailing her legs and kicking me. she got me in the throat and i was letting her go! i was getting off of her when she kicked me right smack in my face full fucking force like she charged that fucking kick up and broke my nose. blood was gushing everywhere and she didn't even care she just left! 

it took forever to stop the bleeding and my face is swollen and ugly. it hurts like a bitch. my friend gave me a bunch of tylenol and it still hurts. i came home and told my parents immediately and they asked me what did *i* do to upset her?! i was so angry i told them i was calling the cops and my dad told me i couldn't go to the cops without parental consent! is that true??? 

something needs to be done about her because she's like getting a lot worse and my mom is 8 months pregnant now and i'm really scared for my little brother when he gets here.  please help me. 

update: well shit went down basically how i expected it would. my mom called me very upset that police had came. what happened is my dad answered the door and he was really mad and probably drunk honestly and they told him they were there to check up on my sister. i asked if my friend's mom would really play up the fact she's crazy af to get her baker acted because i was afraid they wouldn't arrest her and she'd come after me. well my dad didn't want to let the cops in and basically told them to fuck off and they threatened to arrest him if he didn't so he finally let them and i guess my sister must have heard all of this going down so she barricaded herself in her room and wouldn't answer so they broke down the door and they found a bunch of empty pill bottles in her room and she was really disoriented so they called an ambulance and she got taken to the hospital. my mom said she went in after they left and there was a bunch of empty bottles of cough medicine. she said my dad is super pissed but she told me she's honestly relieved.

"my 22f boyfriend's 24m new tattoo makes me feel like a pedophile. hey guys, throwaway account because my boyfriend knows my normal account. 

i don't really know how to begin so i'm just gonna dive right in. we've been together for four years now, living together for 2 and every aspect of our relationship is honestly perfect and i have a sneaking suspicion that he's planning to propose sometime in the near future. 

last year however his younger brother who was only 6 years old, passed away. this took a major toll on my bf (obviously), but especially because he was extremely close with his little brother. his parents are major screw ups to put it bluntly, and as a result his little brother spent a lot of time living with us. to the point where we practically became like a mum and dad to him and even discussed filing for custody. 

the problem arises when a few months ago my boyfriend mentioned he wanted to get a tattoo to commemorate his little brother and asked what my thoughts were on this idea. he has no other tattoos and never expressed wanting one before so i was a little surprised but completely supportive. he talked about getting his brother's name or date of birth or something equally sentimental. cool, i thought. that all sounds beautiful. 

we didn't really talk about it again until he told me he had booked a time in with a tattoo artist. it was on a day i was working so i couldn't go with him and when i asked what he had decided on he said he wanted it to be a surprise. i was really looking forward to seeing it, thinking it was going to be something small and cute.

i did not expect him to come back with an almost life-size headshot of his little brother slapped across the majority of his feckin chest.

it was definitely a shock but i reacted positively and told him it looked really good. it was only the outlines and such at this point and he said he was going to go back and get it filled in...

it's been a few sessions now and he's had the whole shebang done to it. colours, shading, everything to the point where it could be mistaken for a photo now. i can't deny that it's a seriously incredible piece of artwork. bf is super proud of it and i honestly think it's pretty cool as well. 

my only issue with it is during sex. 

it takes up such a large space on his chest and it's the only tattoo he's got. it doesn't help that he's pretty pale and doesn't have much hair so the tattoo really stands out and my attention is constantly drawn to it. 

not to mention this thing is like the mona fu*cken lisa. 

any position that we're facing each other in, i always end up making eye contact with it. and every time i do it makes me feel so uncomfortable and absolutely kills the mood for me. every time. ignoring the fact that this kid was practically like a son to us, i doubt i would be able to have sex while looking into the eyes of any six year old. 

it's honestly ruining our sex life. 

i haven't told my bf any of this because i feel like i can't say anything negative about the tattoo because of its meaning and the fact that it's permanent. (i know lasers exist but i doubt he'll ever get rid of it) 

lately we've mainly been having sex in positions where i'm facing away from him, or while we keep our shirts on and he's started to notice this and has told me he's worried i'm not attracted to him anymore.

i am attracted to him. i'm just not attracted to the six year old on his chest. 

what can i do in this situation? the thought of telling him this, or anything negative about the tattoo makes me feel like a monster. but looking at it during sex is making me feel like a monster too. 

should i talk to him? am i overreacting? is our sex life officially dead? 

thanks for any help you guys can give. 

tl;dr- my boyfriend got a massive tattoo of his recently deceased six-year-old brother on his chest and i can't stop making eye contact with it during sex. 


———————————————————

update: this has gotten a lot more attention than i anticipated. some people are saying it's reached the front page which is making me consider deleting this post. i'm not sure it would be the worst thing if my bf did see this however. currently debating whether i should just let fate take the wheel on this one. 

otherwise i've received some really phenomenal advice on how i should talk to him and what alternatives we have to make sex less awkward. i was honestly beginning to think this was a relationship-ending issue before i made this post but you guys have given me a lot of hope that this is something we can work through. so thank you so much. 

i'll make a new post to update how things go once i've talked to my bf about all this. if he doesn't see this post first i think i'll at least show him some of your comments depending on how he reacts.

"divorce on table because husband and i cant agree on baby's name. hello reddit. this title might look funny but its an actual problem between me (23f) and my husband (24m). 
we've been dating for a year, been married for 2 years. i got pregnant like 7 months ago so recently we started discussing name for the baby. ever since we found out its gonna be a girl my husband wants to name it like his exes name. its not any ex but the one he dated for long period of time and loved the most. in the beginning of our relationship we had may problems because of her but she moved away so the problems went away. he really loved her and he never hid that from me but i thought it was over once she moved away. now he made it clear that he wants the baby to have that name and i can name the second child. when i asked him why does he want that name so badly he said just because he and his ex didnt work out doesnt mean he doesnt want something to keep reminding him of her. he doesnt understand how much its affecting me and keeps saying its just the hormones. 
is he still in love with the ex or its normal that he wants to name our child like that.
thank you! ",7
"i sent a prostitute to my boss' hotel room. this was an accident and happened about 10 years ago.

i had recently joined a chinese owned company in a fairly prominent position and being the only white guy in the company, they liked to send me to trade shows in china to indicate that the company was definitely not chinese.

i was sent to guangzhou to the hotel dong fang just around the corner from the convention centre (extraneous detail not really needed but here to show this is genuine).

of course with a convention centre in town with many visitors, the prostitute madams/agents were out in force. most of the people handing out cards for whores where very young kids (seriously young. they looked about 10 years old or younger), often the only english they spoke was, ""you buy, so cheap"".

every time i went out, i had kids pushing cards into my hands, into my pockets or dropped into any boxes i was carrying. most of the time that was that. end of story.

on my my second to last day, i went out with the sole intention of buying presents for my wife and daughter, when after the first shop i was approached by an older madam who would not leave me alone.

every step of the way she kept with me encouraging me to ""buy, so cheap"". even my protestations that i was married and not interested was met with, ""your wife not here, you buy. so cheap"".

eventually, she said, ""tell me your room number. i send girl to your room. just $200"". thinking this was the best way to get rid of her i said, ""$200? ok, i'm in room 1024"" and then carried on shopping. since this was a fake room number and i had no intention of carrying out the transaction, i promptly forgot about it.

next day, last day of the show, i was told the boss had flown to beijing and i was needed to help a colleague collect some stuff from his hotel room. i walked with my colleague, dodging the kids with prostitute cards, back to the hotel until i was standing outside my boss's room.

room 1024.

i have never, ever dared ask or say anything to my boss about this. only my wife knows this story. and so, too, do you.

tl/dr: i accidentally sent a hooker to my boss's hotel room - pretty much what it says in the title.

"this was my first year filing my own taxes. so, i tried 3 different ""free"" tax softwares to see which company offered the best service.. i'm not here to promote one service over another, but i do want to help other first time filers out there. as i said above, this year was my first year filing my own taxes, after getting charged almost $300 for h&r block to do it for me in one of their offices last year. because of this, i decided to enter my taxes on three different ""free"" tax service websites- h&r block, turbotax and freetaxusa. at the end of the day, my primary goal was to distinguish which product was the best bang for my buck. 

i did this not only to ensure i was getting my maximum refund, but to also see which was the superior service, as i had seen all 3 recommended frequently throughout the sub.  as someone who is completely new to filing their own taxes, freetaxusa was by far the most enjoyable all around experience (as enjoyable as doing your taxes can be, at least.) i would recommend to anyone here that plans to file their taxes themselves to use their service. and yes, i realize everyone's tax situation is different so the ""best"" service is slightly subjective. this was just my experience! 

 it was far and away the cheapest option for my situation, as it actually honored the free filing option for federal and only cost $12.95 for state filing (10% discount if you enter freetaxusa10 in the promo code section at the the end). h&r and turbotax both shot up to between $80-$100 total cost to file my federal and state returns once i entered in my 1098e, 1099-misc, 1099-int and div etc. they also hounded me to upgrade to an even more expensive service throughout literally the entire process. 

freetaxusa walked me through the process very efficiently and painlessly. they went through every possible type of income, credit and deduction i could have.  and most importantly (for me at least), they were true to their word of being a free service. they didn't steadily increase the price as i entered more information and they didn't try to get me to buy additional products and services i didn't need. hope this helps anyone else out there new to the process, without a doubt will be using them again next year! 

edit: someone asked if there was a difference in the amount of my refund (should've included that in the original post, sorry!). but, for federal, no. they all came out exactly the same. for state, yes. freetaxusa found an additional $33 on my state refund that h&r and turbotax did not find. 

edit 2: as mentioned by another user, if you go through ebates you can get an additional 25% off the state fee and it should be stackable with the 10% off promo code. however, i did not try this personally. was unaware at the time!  and some states give the option to file for free through the state. i did not find where my state offers this service, however. 

edit 3: i have seen a few people say they were able to get the free service through turbotax and my post may be a little unintentionally misleading in that regard. yes, i did go through the free file portal with turbotax like i did with the other services. however, once i began entering my income information, that is when i was disqualified from the free service and i was automatically placed into a paid service. turbotax does offer free filing, but only if you make less than 34k a year or are a military member that makes less than 66k a year, and i'm neither! sorry if i mislead anyone! 

also, it makes a difference in price with h&r and turbotax if you have a 1098e/1098t, self employment/contract labor income, savings account interest, an hsa, investment income etc., and freetaxusa doesn't charge for entering these forms. some of these things do apply to my 2018 tax situation, which is likely a major reason it was so much more expensive to file with  h&r and turbotax. as i said in the post, everyone's tax situation is slightly different and i'm not trying to promote certain products over others! just wanted to provide my personal experience! 

final edit (hopefully): a lot of people are under the assumption that you have to wait until the 28th to file, but that is not the case. if you have all of your documents you can file earlier. the irs may even accept your return early to use while they test out their system. i completed mine yesterday and actually got an email from freetaxusa a few minutes ago stating that my refund had been accepted by the irs and i would be getting my refund within 21 days. 

much requested tl:dr: for my tax situation, which included several sources of income, i would recommend freetaxusa. the interface is very user friendly, the cost of my service remained free and did not increase as i entered more information, i was not pestered to upgrade into a more expensive service throughout the process and i was able to get an additional discount on my state filing cost.

"update to my (22f) twin (22f) has slept or tried to sleep with every one of my boyfriends. don't want her to meet current boyfriend (23m) of 8 months.. https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dckm1r/my_22f_twin_22f_has_slept_or_tried_to_sleep_with/

so i've made a lot of changes in my family life since i posted this a couple weeks ago. i first told everything to my boyfriend. he was shocked and assured me he'd never cheat on me with my sister or anyone else. he also respected that i didn't want her to meet him. 

i decided to take the advice given and block her on social media. she immediately noticed like within ten minutes after i'd blocked she sent a text saying ""did you block me on instagram and facebook??"" so i didn't beat around the bush, i said yes because i didn't like how she's messed with my personal relationships. she tried to guilt trip me about how i hadn't told her about my boyfriend (which means my parents must have told her about him like i knew they would). she exploded at me because according to her she would never have tried to ""stalk him or anything"", but i hadn't even gotten a chance to say i was worried she'd do this. she said it first so what does that say?

i told her i flat out didn't trust her to not try to take people from me. she called me psycho and selfish, but whatever really. i can't reason with her. she just never sees the problem with anything she's done. the way she thinks makes it like arguing with a young child almost.

i blocked her number, i still feel kind of bad doing this because what if there was an emergency and she needed me. but we live hours apart, so i figure/hope my parents would be who she contacted in that case...

then, as for them, i also got a call from my mom soon after i blocked my sister who wanted to know what i was doing because she was upset. she'd already heard my sister's side which was just that i'd blocked her out of nowhere. so i tried to tell her my side. i did not tell her my sister's personal business about drugs and having sex, like i said in the first post i'm not going to fall to petty revenge. i just want her to stop interfering in my life. so all i said was that in the past she's been inappropriate with guys i've dated and has spread rumors about me and it made me unable to trust her. my mom then wanted to know what i meant by inappropriate (my parents are really conservative and don't believe in having sex before marriage). she also got my dad on the call at this point. i told them the details didn't matter. she kept trying to go back to this point, even wanting to know if i had been having premarital sex. it was really frustrating. 

i told them the point i'm trying to make is that my sister has broken my trust. they began saying i should forgive her because they care about our family and don't want to see us fighting. well i'm not exactly fighting. i'm simply not going to be in contact with her. to them it's the same thing. 

then they wanted me to come home for a weekend to discuss everything as a family. i said i wasn't going to do that, that i'd made my decision, and have no time for a trip. they said they'd come to me then. that brought up how they show up for random visits even when i've said i don't like it. i told them i didn't want them doing that anymore, and if they did it again i wouldn't let them in or talk with them. so they flipped out, that was fun, i got to hear all how i'm constantly making problems and don't care about my family.

i ended up having to block their numbers because they kept calling back. and blocking on facebook because they were sending messages going back and forth between begging to talk and accusing me of being a terrible daughter and sister.

i don't know wtf i'm going to do about them. they did threaten to stop paying for my college if i cut them out of my life. i unblocked them to say i want to be in touch with them and do love them but i can't do the unexpected visits, or them prying into my personal life. i said if they stop doing that then i'm happy to have a relationship with them. they had a million reasons why i'm in the wrong. i couldn't deal with it and reblocked them yesterday. so i don't know what my tuition deal is going to be now.

my boyfriend at least has been really supportive during this shit. he thinks my parents are way out of line and my sister is crazy. he's really helped keep me as sane as i can be. 

overall i just feel really shitty. i wish any of them would ever listen to what i say. but if they won't then what can i do besides put up with what you all pointed out was really controlling, or take more control back myself. it just sucks it has to be so...final, i guess. i wouldn't mind a middle ground like planning a visit with them once in a while, or talking with my sister about nonpersonal things, but they want way more than i do. 

tl;dr: i'm not going to be in contact with my family for the foreseeable future.",7

"for going to my sister's dream school when she just got rejected?. update(https://www.reddit.com/r/amitheasshole/comments/ca82iu/update_aita_for_going_to_my_sisters_dream_school/)

so, i got into cornell last week. honestly i think it was fluke. i'm not smart, at all. i got a 28 act, a decent gpa (because my school grade inflates considerably). i had some decent extracurriculars but nothing remotely competitive enough to get me to a school like cornell. but anyways...

my twin sister is the opposite of me. she's a genius, she has way more impressive stats (34 act and she only took it once, compared to my 3 times), she has way better grades, way cooler extracurriculars. everyone always looked up to her as the smart one. i didn't and still don't mind, it's true. the only reason i can fathom i got in and she didn't is that she applied to the engineering college while i applied to arts and sciences (i don't know if too many of you guys are familiar with cornell, but they have a bunch of different colleges you can apply to, each with their different admission criteria). 

well last week, decisions for ivies came out.  unfortunately for my sister, she didn't get into a single one, including her first choice (cornell). she checked as soon as it was available and called me bawling. i consoled her and told her everything was going to be okay, that who cares what school you go to, that she was brilliant and was going to be successful no matter where she goes. 

well anyways, i pretty much resolved that i was getting rejected, so i didn't even bother to look at my email until later that night. well, i guess surprises do happen sometime, because i'm a cornellian. i got in. i just don't know how but i did. 

i really want to go guys. but this would devastate my sister. all week she's been crying and solemn and sad. she's been angry at her friends who got into top schools (especially the ones with lower stats).  she's decided to go to nyu, but she just hasn't been herself. i haven't told our parents (i think they assumed i didn't get in because she didn't). 

am i being selfish? should i just go with her to nyc? we always thought we were going to school together but like... it's cornell. i couldn't in a million years imagine i'd get in. i've been researching obsessively about it and i can't shake the desire that if i don't go, i'll regret it. ithaca looks beautiful, it's a small town (which i would love to get away with from the huge city that is new york). it seems like a dream opportunity. 

am i being a bad sister? i know she would be upset; we were supposed to go to school together. it would crush her. i really don't have anyone else to talk to :(. for going to her dream school? especially considering how much harder she's worked compared to me...

tldr: dumb sister (me) gets into cornell. smart sister didn't. she's depressed. it was her first choice. i want to go tho. aita?

update: so everyone here told me that i should go, so i decided to tell my sister. 

well, she started screaming from excitement and got (not actually) mad that how couldn't i tell her earlier and she's so proud of me

but seconds later, her excitement just turned to....sadness. she went from like super giddy to depressed in like seconds,, and she started bawling. like uncontrollably bawling. i tried to comfort but she pushed me away and locked herself in our room...

i going to give her some alone time right now and we can talk more about it later.

update 2: please let me know if my updates are annoying; i only expected 3-4 comments and didn't know so many people were interested, so i thought least i could do is update 

so after 5 mins of the previous post, my sister sent me a text. it said:

> i'm sorry for how i reacted; please don't be mad. i'm so happy for you and your accomplishments. it's just that after i got rejected, i at least had the consolation that i get to go to school with you and we can go together. but now you're going to be where i wanted to be and i'm just so sad. i worked so hard and did everything i could to go to the best school i can and i just feel like all my hard work was just wasted effort. i'm sorry i'm ranting i just need more time

i'm not going to lie guys, when i read this, i cried. a lot of you are saying that i obviously i have to have attributes that made me desiresble but i really don't. i don't deserve my acceptance. i did my homework between classes, barely studied for anything, took the easiest ap classes available, etc. meanwhile i see my sister always taking the hardest classes, studying as hard as she can, always volunteering. she deserves it, not me, and seeing her so hurt pains me. i'm really strongly just considering going to nyu with her. everyone at cornell will just be just like her and i don't stand a chance. and i know if i go to cornell, we're going to drift apart which would suck because we're best friends and i just don't want to lose my sister :(

update 3: so i told my parents and they did not react how i would've expected them to. first, they tried to insist that cornell made a mistake between our applications (which would be impossible; if we applied to the same school within cornell, like we both applied to arts and sciences, then it would be somewhat probable, but we applied to different schools with different admission committees. they couldn't have mixed them up). 

then they went on to explain how i should go to nyu with my sister. i thought it was strange, because they definitely would've supported my sister going to cornell if i didn't get in. my sister apparently thought so too, because she asked why would i not go to cornell, and they said how it was unfair that i basically slacked off in high school and was able to go, when my sister was the hardworking one who busted her ass all of school. i don't know if i'm being dramatic, but that hurt. i knew they always thought my sister was the smarter one (they've made it clear multiple times), but to hear them say that i don't deserve my spot sucks. even though they're probably right.

i stood there in silence, but my sister stood up for me. she asked them how could they say something so cruel to their daughter, that i 100% have every right to be there, and that they should apologize for being so rude. my parents were shocked because we're both very passive people, and neither of us ever talked to them like that before. this started an argument and long story short, we're currently in our rooms. i'm just so thankful to have her stand up for me. i realize that i have internalized a lot of the comments they've made over the years. i'm glad i have my sister actually believe in me.

i still don't know if i want to go to nyu or cornell, mostly because i just don't want to go to school without her. she's my best friend, and going 4 years without someone who just thinks so positively about you just seems so long. at the end of the day, i always thought the nyu was going to be the school i was going to, so i wouldn't lose much by choosing it over cornell. i'm going to talk about it more with my sister and look into both schools more. thanks again everybody for your comments; i wouldn't have realize how important of a person my sister is if you guys didn't give me the courage to tell her that i got in.

update 3.5: no new news but i just wanted to say that i'm reading every single comment and i apologize if i don't get to you individually and i appreciate everyone's overwhelming support! you guys are amazing :)",3
"dig out your own plumbing people!. had a blockage in a drain pipe. it was so bad snaking didn't work and got an estimate of $2,500 to dig and replace. got a few more estimates that were around the same range $2k-$3k.
i asked the original plumber, the one who attempted to snake it,  how far down the line the blockage was. then i proceeded to spend the evening digging it out myself. had a plumber replace the line for $250 a grand total of $2.25k savings in exchange for 3 hours of digging.

"my wife is done with sex and im not ready to be celibate for the rest of my life... are we done?. since finishing having kids a few years ago, my (now 39yo) wife has not been interested in sex - for a long time she would go though the motions for my sake but grew to resent the ""chore"" more and more to the point where she would avoid me like the plague and we were fighting about it all the time. she swears its not me and that its not due to bad performance etc... she just doesnt want to.

we have done some reading and been to a councillor but it always ends up along the ""learning to be nicer to her so she'll get in the mood"" lines which is rubbish for our situation. no matter how happy, relaxed, rested, etc she is, the idea of sex is an instant agitation to her and she gets mad.

essentially...
- if i try to get her in the mood, she gets pissed.
- if i am super nice and thoughtful etc, she is happy but nothing happens.
- if i do nothing, nothing happens.

recently ive stopped asking... and the fighting has stopped and she's happy... but im dying inside.

is our relationship over and we just need to cut the cord? or is it normal and do i need to just come to terms with my sex life being over? i dont want an affair etc, i want my wife to want a physical relationship with me... is that too much to ask?

"my f28 mil won't take my kid's 4 anaphylactic peanut allergy seriously. **update at bottom of post.**

i'll try to keep this as short as possible. sorry for mobile formatting. i've never really seen eye-to-eye with my mil because she's very strict and old fashioned, she's like this with all of her grandchildren: she'll do things like yell at them for not sitting up straight, elbows on table, etc... i understand that children need discipline, but i prefer a gentler approach with my son. i've asked her many times to not do that, but my husband insists i let it go, so i've tried to. 

until now. my son was officially diagnosed with a life threatening peanut allergy, and we have an epipen jr for him. she insists that when she was younger people ""didn't have allergies"", and if they did they would get rid of them via exposure and that i'm just babying him. i've explained to her that his allergy is very real and potentially deadly.

she has basically scoffed it off and the last time she came to pick him up, she took his epipen/fanny pack from around his waist and threw it on my driveway, saying she's taken him for ice cream many times and nothing has ever happened, and he doesn't ""need it"" with him. i told him she could no longer take him and brought him inside, she left and called my husband, she cried to him saying i accused her of being an unfit grandmother. which i admittedly did because my child's safety is my priority and apparently not hers. 

now my husband wants me to apologise to her. he says she would take him to the hospital if he ingested peanuts and that i'm overreacting. i kindly explained to him that epipens save lives because anaphylaxis means your airways are narrowing, your breathing is becoming blocked, etc... and time is of the essence because it happens so quickly. 

so, now my stance is.. no epipen = no taking my child anywhere.

she's even insisting on taking him to a baseball game, which tends to have a lot of peanuts, everywhere. i asked that she find a peanut free zone which the stadium does offer, but she once again belittled the idea and insisted he would be fine. 

i'm getting really tired of her treatment toward my son, and my husband has always been a mama's boy who thinks mama can do no wrong and defends her endlessly. he says he turned out just fine being raised by her and i worry too much. 

would it be awful if i insist she only see him if i'm present? am i completely unreasonable and overreacting? is there anything else i can do so that they'll understand the severity or at the very least take some more precautions?



**edit/mini-update**: first of all, woah. i did not expect this to get so much attention. thank-you to each and every one of you who took time out of your day to reply. in case you missed it: i've left for now, removed my son from the situation, and i'm now currently staying at my brother's house. at least for a few days until things cool off and i'm able to have a sit down discussion with my husband and his mother. in the mean time, i've sent them both links to the reddit threads with anecdotal experiences where anaphylaxis occurred (like the heartbreaking coconut oil one). unfortunately, this isn't really a case of not being educated on the subject. my husband has been to the same appointments i have with my son, he just chooses to throw all his knowledge out the window to appease his mother and avoid ""defying"" her.

some people have accused me of being a helicopter mom, or trying to demonize my mil. and given the circumstance, that's fine, maybe i'm overreacting or being overbearing but as long as my son is breathing, then i'm okay. i'm not even a sahm, we have an incredible nanny while i work ft, who respects my kid's allergies and adores him. in the past, i've tried my best for my mil to get quality time with her grandson, although we may not see eye-to-eye, i've wanted him to grow up knowing grandma. but i'm not jeopardizing my son's safety in order to be socially correct.

lastly, i just want to say my mil has diabetes and is against modern medicine and sees a naturopath. she won't take metformin or insulin and thinks everything can be treated herbally. so, i don't think having a sit down with an actual physician explaining epinephrine and anaphylaxis to her is going to help much. she's very strong in her beliefs. i did text her asking if she would be open to just hearing a doctor out and she's yet to reply. my husband has replied saying he doesn't have ""time to read f'ing reddit threads or watch educational videos"", so i told him to find time or he won't be getting any time with my son until he does. if he's going to be so careless, i'll end up dealing with this legally. 

thanks again everyone. words can't express my gratitude. i will update with a new thread eventually.",7
"minnesota: landlord let people into my apartment and they robbed me. what now?. for some background i am renting an apartment and my lease ends on september 30th. my landlord is an older guy who inherited this house; not a professional company or anything like that. i do have a lease that says i get 24 hours notice for entry except emergencies which i believe is the law itself, but in this case i did not get that notice.

last week my landlord texted me shortly after 8am saying someone is interested in buying the house from him (he has not previously brought up selling it so this was unexpected). he asked if i could let them in to see the place at 10, and then at 9:30 texted again saying he's guessing i'm at work so he's just going to let them pick up a key from them and lock up when they are done looking.

i did not see these messages until i took lunch at 12. i texted my landlord back saying i thought i am supposed to get notice for entry and i'm not comfortable with him letting people in unattended, he said sorry but they are going out of town and won't be back for two weeks so it was an emergency (though i'm sure that doesn't legally count).

long story short they robbed me and i have it on security video but police weren't able to get much information from it because their vehicle is common and has no license plate, and they wore hoods and bandanas so you can't tell much about their faces. they took everything of value such as laptop and tv and even some stupid things like my lamps.

my renter's insurance originally was going to cover it but said they need a copy of the police report, and the police report explains the situation that my landlord gave them a key (as opposed to them breaking in). now the renter's insurance says they cover breaking and entering resulting in loss but these circumstances makes it a civil issue instead of an insurance issue and i should seek to get reimbursed for my losses by my landlord instead.

meanwhile my landlord is an idiot and did not even know these people. he met them at dennys, only got their first names and gave them his phone number and told them his own address to pick the key up, but didn't get any of their information whatsoever like phone number or anything. i told him my renter's insurance won't cover this and because this was caused by him literally giving strangers a key to the place i would like him to reimburse me for my losses, he says he's sorry but at the end of the day it's these guys that owe me and not him and offered to talk to the police more to give them more description to find the guys but that's all he can do to help.

what now? push my renter's insurance, sue the landlord, give up and cry? i would appreciate any advice anyone might have on what my best option is at this point.",2
"for refusing to give my niece our dog's room?. for the past month my 24 year old niece has been living with us. i'll call her princess because that's what her parents call her most of the time. she is a medical researcher (studied medicine but wasn't interested in the practical side of things more interested in the theoretical) and took up a position near where we live, and my sister convinced me to let her stay so she can save money. i was apprehensive because i know this girl has been coddled and babied since she was little. 

we have a 4 bedroom house. me and my husband, my son (16), my daughter (21) and our 4 year old rottweiler freddie. i told sister that princess would have to sleep on the sofa in the living room which she seemed ok with, but when she arrived both mother and daughter set about trying to convince me to clear out the dog's room and let her sleep in it. princess even said it would be ok to make him sleep outside because ''it's just a dog''. it's getting a lot colder now and i'd never let freddie sleep outside. 

i told princess that this is where she'd sleep, take it or leave it, and she was and still is really sulky about it, sulking about how we think a dog is more important than her. 

in all honesty i was right in thinking having princess stay is more trouble than it's worth. she goes out clubbing and partying a lot and makes no effort to keep the noise down when she comes home in the early hours of the morning. since she's arrived the living room smells of weed and that smell definitely wasn't there before she came. 

she's also rude to my kids. my daughter got engaged and we were all delighted, but princess was lovely enough to say that if her bf had gotten her a ''cheap'' ring like that she wouldn't even get out of bed for the wedding. daughter was in tears because of this and both husband and i had a word with princess, who then cried and phoned up her mother saying we were rude to her. 

had another phone call with sister today, and she still tried to convince me to put her daughter in the dog's room. i made clear this wasn't happening and sister got upset with me saying how nasty it was to value pets over family. i also said that her daughter was skating thin ice and that i wouldn't tolerate her behaviour for much longer. sister was very offended and said we should be happy to have her daughter there. sorry but how can i be happy to have a spoiled overgrown child who keeps trying to steal a room from a dog in my home?

edit: a lot of replies here who don't seem to understand the situation. i won't say too much as apparently arguing gets you banned from here. firstly to the people who have claimed i was acting snobby about princess's job. that wasn't the case. i wasn't saying that she was more interested in the theoretical side of things so that i could say she's ''only a researcher''. on the contrary, i specifically mentioned that she studied medicine so that people understood that she had a well paid job in a selective intellectual field and wasn't some lab assistant or something like that. she earns enough that she could afford a place of her own if she wanted. she just wanted more money to herself. 

also, the people who claim that i was being nasty to her because i didn't like her and things like that. i don't dislike her at all. i was apprehensive about having her because having known her since she was born, i've seen many of her tantrums and seen her parents give in to them over and over again even into her adulthood. i was worried about how things would turn out since we wouldn't give into her demands. she has tried to pick on both my children when she was a teenager and we went through a period a few years back when my daughter refused to visit their home because princess constantly bullied her. 

regarding the dog's room. there isn't any furniture in freddie's room that a 24 year old woman could comfortably sleep on, and we weren't about to go and buy furniture since we didn't know how long she'd be staying. 

and for those who think i was trying my best to make her uncomfortable, not at all. we tried our best to make her feel welcome. gave her as much space as she wanted and left the living room whenever she needed privacy. we gave her food and while she brought more than enough clothes for home, i went clothes shopping with her and was happy to pay out of my own pocket. within her first week here, princess couldn't stop laughing when my daughter told her what she did for a living (hairdresser), said that freddie should sleep outside and shouted at my husband because he hadn't cooked dinner quick enough, so you can't blame all this on me. 

regarding the weed and clubbing thing: i've nothing against weed use. i smoked it a few times as a teenager, as did my husband, and i'm 99% sure my kids have both done it at some point, but that fact is it's completely illegal in this country. if she was doing it away from the house i would not care at all. i wouldn't even have too much of a problem if she was smoking it outside, but it is obvious from the strong smell that she is smoking it in the house. i'm well aware that going out clubbing and making noise is what most people her age do. however, this particular 24 year old doesn't bother to take her high heels off when she comes in, and as we have a wooden floor we can hear her stomping around in them which wakes us all up. 

last but not least, i didn't call her ''princess'' on here offensively. i wasn't going to put her real name on here obviously, and the fact is her parents genuinely do nickname her princess most of the time, and she doesn't mind it when they call her it.",3
"my husband constantly bodyshames me.. i was around 5'1 and 100 lbs when we got married and six years later, i'm 5'1 and 125 lbs. he constantly comments on my body and my weight even though i've never asked for his opinion.  i know my body isn't perfect, but i'm working on accepting that. 

actual things he has said to me

1. (a day after i gave birth and was getting dressed in front of him) - *disgusted tone and expression* ""is your stomach going to stay like that?"" by the way it takes two weeks for the uterus to return to normal size

2. ""it's not baby weight when the baby is two years old.""

3. ""your thighs are huge. when you sit down, they look even more enormous""

4. ""it's like you've lost the weight everywhere except for your hips. it's very noticeable from behind. i'll even take a photo and show you so you can see for yourself how fat your ass is""

5. ""i'm just motivating you to lose weight. 
who else is going to tell you that you're fat?""

6. he even has a game he plays with our three year old daughter: 
 ""who's the tall one?"" - her: ""daddy""
 ""who's the cute one?"" - ""me!""
""who's the fat one?"" - ""mommy!!"" and they both laugh at me. okay haha very funny.

7. ""why do you keep trying on clothes if you're never going to buy anything? you keep saying it doesn't look good on you but the truth is that thin people (he meant women) don't need to try on clothing because they look good in everything. so maybe just lose weight before you go clothes shopping again.""

8. ""short and fat isn't a good combination""

and so on. on average, he'll make 1-2 body shaming comments a week. i've talked to him about it but he says he just wants me to be healthy and fit. it's hurtful, and unhelpful, and unhealthy for my daughter to hear those comments from her dad about her mom.",7
"for secretly feeding my sister vegetables?. my sister is 16 and heavily overweight. she's  5'2 or 5'3 but 170+lbs. she's already pre-diabetic and if she doesn't lose weight pronto she'll have to go on metformin. diabetes runs in our family (my mom and grandma both have it) and as it is she already has really low energy levels and clumps of her hair is falling out!! i'm really worried about her and have tried to introduce her to various forms of ""fun"" exercises (like swimming, those weird indoor cycling classes with the edm and the lights and shit, 30-minute walks, wall climbing) but she absolutely hated it all. the other thing is, she doesn't eat any fruits or vegetables, except maybe potatoes, and bananas when they're in ""acceptable"" forms like in chocolate-banana smoothies or in banana bread.

as a last-ditch attempt, a couple of days ago i decided to just take over the family menu and feed her dishes that secretly have vegetables in them. for breakfast i made green smoothies but add lots of (sugar-free) matcha to explain the ""green"" color and mask the flavors of the fruits and veggies. i make ""cheese"" sauces out of pumpkin and carrots and flavor them with nutritional yeast. i mix crushed cauliflower into fried rice, etc etc. i have to lie about them because even if it tastes good, if she *knows* there are fruits or veggies she doesn't like in the dish, she'll immediately stop eating it.

it was going well until our mom found out the dishes secretly had vegetables in it. she started this whole argument about how it was ""unethical"" to lie to my sister about what we were feeding her and it escalated into a yelling match where i told my mom she clearly wasn't worried enough about my sister's health and that she knew nothing about nutrition. (she thinks apple pie is healthy???) my mom has banned me from preparing the meals and is guilt-tripping me for lying, but i really think i was making an honest effort to help? i feel bad for yelling at my mom but i dunno, was i really such an asshole for lying about the vegetables?

**edit:** i really didn't expect my post would blow up like this. i just want to emphasize that i'm not a nutritionist or a doctor, i just listen to what the doctor + nutritionist says during the monthly checkups and take that as fact, so thank you so much for pointing several things out. i will try to be more self-informed in the future. i've taken note of her possibly having arfid, thyroid problems, or pcos and will try to get my mom to get her to a therapist as well as a doctor, thanks very much for bringing these up. also, my mom is really hard-headed but she's still trying, i feel bad that i've made such a horrible impression of her. she has type 1 diabetes that she has to manage on top of her job and taking care of us 2 kids so please don't say she's terrible :( also, everyone asking me for my recipes can check my comments, i made a comment on this post detailing how i did the cheese sauce and stuff. thank you very much for your suggestions, i really appreciate them.

**edit 2**: my mom has type 1 diabetes, my grandma on my dad's side has type 2. according to the doctor my sister is at risk for type 2 because of her high blood sugar + high cholesterol.",3

"by forgetting babies exist.. so i've been spending a lot of time around dogs. i've recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. my reddit is covered in dogs from various sources. my facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. basically everywhere i turn, i see dog. not a bad life to live. until yesterday (yifu i know). i walked one of my mother's friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. it wasn't very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. it's hot. i've just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. i want to blame dehydration for this fu, but really i know i'm just an idiot. a couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. my first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. i don't know. it's a hot day and i've seen dogs in pushchairs before. maybe they didn't want its paws on hot tarmac. maybe they're just a little extra. regardless, the thought that babies exist didn't enter my tiny stupid brain. as they got up to leave and walk by me, i decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words ""what breed is it?"" and gestured towards the pushchair. they looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. it was a baby. a human baby. i'm so glad they took the traditional british approach of confused stare and silence. if they had said something i think i would have disintegrated on the spot. it was a long walk home after that and thankfully, i didn't pass anymore pushchairs.

"update i'm out $600 after my(29m) best friend(31m) and his wife(29f) made me the door mat at their wedding.. hey folks.

in proper internetiquette, i'd like to first say thank you to the community for your incredible response to what was a really bad day. i received so much support, constructive criticism, advice, and just genuine human connection. your concern, discernment, thoughtfulness... this is one of the best reasons for the internet to exist. even your scorn, some of you. i'm a big believer in ripping off the band-aid, and ya'll really let me have it. but when i said before that i wanted to take all of it in, i meant it. i intend to walk away from this situation a better person than before. tl;dr at bottom.

to the meat and potatoes: **i got my money back.** it wasn't as difficult as some of you feared. it was a simple text exchange yesterday, no heavy words. i also got a thank you from the newlyweds separately. i was surprised by the bride, but i welcomed it. you should welcome all positivity. i said my congratulations again and moved on with my life. i feel like, thanks to you all, i explored every thread in the tapestry of how i should feel and what i could say. it brought a well-measuredness to my thinking that otherwise would have taken maybe months to come by. you saved me from miles of tortured internal dialogue during my daily commute. you saved me from rash actions and words i wouldn't have been able to take back.

i know some of you will wish i went off. but i want peace, and what's the metaphor? bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity? i just don't need that kind of negativity in my life and what i'm trying to say is, i know now that i was just as responsible for how terrible an experience i had. this isn't a self-blame thing, i'm not being low-self esteem. the fact of the matter is, i could have said no, and i could have established a pattern of saying ""no"" to things prior to this that would not have led me to being treated the way i was treated. from so many of you i've learned that this is called self-worth. self-worth would not have seen me say endlessly, ""sure.""

don't get me wrong. i still 100% believe that if someone asks you to do something on their wedding day that you can do without undue burden to yourself, you should do that thing. it's their wedding day. and this goes double for people you're very close to. but you should also know your own limits, and you should teach those limits to others in how you allow yourself to be treated. and yeah, i accept that some of the things asked of me that day, in the context of being very close friends, seemed really shitty, and it felt that way. but from the moment the last groomsmen invitation went out, i should have reassessed the relationship. measured my value without the context of groom's friendship and focused on that.

i think part of the reason why i took so much on was to prove that, even in the face of being called unworthy, i could stand tall as the good friend and person i know i am. maybe some small part of me thought i could prove to the bride that i was someone she should have always counted on. show the groom how a groomsmen should be. this was foolish in a lot of ways, and it ended up costing me all of this torment. you should do good things not to prove a point, but because it adds value to the world. this can be done in a way that doesn't eat you from the inside. i know this now.

so what's the plan from here vis-a-vis my relationship with my friend? i think he made that clear. if i was so important to groom, i'd have been by his side that day, but i'm not so important, and so i wasn't. this is fine. it was his decision, and i told him myself the day he told me i was originally on the roster, ""no matter what anyone says, you need to choose the people who will get you down that aisle."" it's not the place of anyone else to judge his choices. certainly not me. not anymore. ultimately, this means i maintain a respectful distance, but will emphasize the distance. i have no intention of chasing after others to be in my life. when you find the right people, there is no chase. and one day, i'll let him know why he's the usher at my wedding. i don't think that's vindictive more than it is reciprocation. we won't have hella cursive name cards.

i want to impress upon you, if you are still reading this, that you have been part of my evolution. i was already in a place of growth and recovery and building, and god damn if this experience and your input wasn't a hell of a step towards becoming a better me. i'm not going to be a doormat, but i'm also not going to be fucking heartless. if people need help and i can help, i will. i'll just love myself better by knowing when to stop. i know that i'm a good friend, and a great person, and i'm not going to let my mistakes, or anyone else's, change that.

i know that i still have my problems and i'm working through them, and if, when reading my experience, you felt a bit of yourself in me, i want to encourage you: i used to be so self-conscious about myself, i'd sit down with my knees pressed inward and and my arms crossed tight because i didn't want anyone to notice how much space my fatness took up. i used to think that the only reason women smiled at me was because they were politely hoping i'd go away. i used to think that, to have friends and be accepted, you had to give them every bit of value you possess. i'm not that guy anymore, even if the wedding proved that i still have old tendencies, and if you're going through something like this, you can change, too.

i mentioned i was always an overweight person, but i should also say that i've lost 122lbs to date and i'm going to keep going (my goal is another 50lbs). at my average weekly rate, i'll hit my goal in less than six months. if you're struggling similarly, i want you to know that you can do it (dm for emotional weight loss support, please no essential oil pitches). also, this was supposed to be a thing where i counterpoint each of the previously stated insecurities in the above paragraph with some stark successes, but tbh women i'm in to still don't seem romantically interested in me, or i can't tell if they are (dm your relationship tips on how to figure this mystery out), but i'm not so insecure about it anymore. i know that when women smile at me, it's because i made a really bad pun and their better senses betrayed the smile. finally, and this is key, i know who my friends are, and i know that i never had to do anything but be my fucking self and they'd gravitate towards me (you might be thinking of a fat joke here, don't). i know that my real friends asked why i was working the wedding. they asked not why, but how in the hell wasn't i the best man, let alone not be in the wedding party. they tried to get me to stand up and dance when they noticed i was down. they invited me in to pictures. they said they wished i'd had a better time. they commiserated with me the morning after the wedding. they told me, in no uncertain words, that they appreciated how i go above and beyond for people. they told me that, at some point, i have to ask myself if doing this was worth overspending myself. focus on these kinds of people in your life.

you'll have your lingering questions about this. i'm sorry that this post became more of a introspective reflection rather than going in to more details about the wedding drama, of which, naturally, there was no shortage. if you have more questions, ask them and i'll answer. if you have more advice, i'm all ears.

i just want to close with this: so many of you offered to be my friend, and i want to live up to that. the heaviness i felt was lifted, message by message, in your every positive thought and shared painful experience. you helped me feel not alone. i want this to be the standard for everyone moving forward. please, treat each other like good friends. if you are ever down, if you ever want advice, if you need to hear an embarrassing life story to bring levity to your situation (my life story is filled with movie-level embarrassment) please dm this account. i'm here for you.

"update: i am supposed to have money put aside for me for university from both of my deceased parents. my step mom says there is no money left and what was left by my dad was used to send my step-siblings to university and pay for the family's expenses. can someone help me please?. i posted this a few weeks ago:  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i\_am\_supposed\_to\_have\_money\_put\_aside\_for\_me\_for/(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/cxprda/i_am_supposed_to_have_money_put_aside_for_me_for/)

i just wanted to say thank you to all the advice and help i received (especially derspiny). i was able to get in touch with an awesome lawyer who specializes in wills and trusts, who after explaining my whole situation to him he was willing to do the discovery for free.

he was able to find that i not only have 1 trusts, but 2 trusts for me. one of the trusts was setup a long time ago, most likely by my mother and is still intact and safe (which was more than enough for me). unfortunately the second trust was most likely ""improperly setup or handled"", as it seems to have been emptied about 2 years ago.

he gave me a bunch more useful advice and gave me detailed instructions on how to use the trust properly, along with a bunch of recommendations to ensure the money is not touched by my step mother or siblings.

i also managed to talk to my step siblings and basically learned that:

* they both considered themselves estranged from my step mother, my older step brother pays for her utilities/rent but that is it. they aren't on speaking terms in anyway, and recommended me to get out right away.
* apparently my step sister also was supposed to have a bunch of money for her education only for it to mysteriously just dry up after her first year of university. with her  mom telling her she spent all her 4 years of tuition in 1 year. so now she is paying her way. 

anyways i have decided to basically keep my head down for the last year of high school and get out as soon as university starts, and never look back.

thank you so much for your help.",2
"by buying my mom an amazon device.. i want to start by giving some background here. i basically live, eat, sleep and breath amazon. i need something, straight to amazon. i use kindle and audible daily. want to stream music, amazon music. want a new movie, prime video. run out of something randomly, ""hey alexa......."" laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. amazon has the answers to all of life's problems. so when looking for a place to store photos, i see ""prime members have free unlimited photo storage with amazon photos"". naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. automatically upload photos from my phone? even better. 

rewind to september 25th, my mom's birthday. i thought about her gift for a while, but when i remembered she didn't have a smart tv, the answer was easy. i hop on amazon shopping and use my amazon credit card to purchase one firetv stick. she was so happy she could watch netflix on her tv now. yay, success! or so i thought. 

yesterday i get an email from amazon with the subject line ""welcome to the fire tv family"" and thought oh good, she's finally setting it up, she's gonna love it! not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did i imagine that it would sign in to my amazon account without even asking for a password. surely she'd have to use her own account. 

fast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. eventually it's forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. sitting in my mother's kitchen, i glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65"" photo of my vagina. 

i spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. i happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. i'm not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. i took probably 40 pictures that night for my so to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my entire family to view. i have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there's no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. 

nobody helped me. the remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where i'm currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. i didn't give anyone a chance to say anything, i just ran away. 

the worst part, i asked alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand ""sorry, i'm not sure about that."" fuck amazon.

update: i promised an update but it's not really worthy of its own post. i talked to my mom who assured me that it's not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it's just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. however, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. 

i'm not sure how to prove that this wasn't an amazon ad, i just wrote it how i wrote it because i thought it was funny. i wish amazon was paying me for this crap. 

i'm just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. yes i fucked up, i was a dumbass, that's why i posted it here. yes, i should have known this could happen. call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my so do. it's fun. i don't intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. it happened.

"if you're renting, you need to run credit and criminal checks on all adults. hi. just like a psa. i have friends who recently became landlords and despite my advising them strongly they needed to run background and credit checks, they didn't. guess how that turned out. i used to work as a property manager and the reality is most folks who turned up, couldn't get approved. i learned quickly not to judge a book by its cover. lots of lovely, polite people with horrific rental history, credit or criminal past. let the big complexes who are desperate for tenants be the ones who deal with the bad credit, terrible tenant history, criminal history folks. there are many people out there just hunting for a private landlord who doesn't check and as soon as they're in, they won't ever pay again. my friends looked into their history after the fact, yeah, this is their m.o. exactly. they'll never see a dime meanwhile they're paying the mortgage and water and now for the eviction which will take months.

check. every time. no exceptions.

itt: people acting like locking your doors amounts to theft.

thanks for the graphic, long death threats. fo.

also, lots of people pming me about having bad credit themselves. look loads of landlords rent to folks with less than perfect credit / criminal history / landlord history / income. honestly i suspect most do. the ones i've worked for definitely do. the folks that almost no one will rent to are the ones who force an eviction immediately after moving in, never intended to pay once they got tenants rights and trash the house on the way out and do this repeatedly. i promise they're out there. tons of folks do this shit. i get we have a housing crisis but its just insane to think we solve this by having every person who has property to rent play craps with their kids college fund or their retirement savings.

also, i get it losers. the proletariat is going to rape my eye holes while i watch my family bleed out. you don't need to keep messaging me that. i've already gotten the message. i suspect you're the same assholes out there trashing houses, destroying people's nest egg / retirement funds / kids college funds / lives.

"i stole thousands of dollars in change over 2 years working at mcdonalds. when i was 16 i got a job at mcdonald's. i hated making food and working front counter. i always asked to work drive thru window taking money at the first window. 
this was before credit cards so everyone paid in cash. all i would do is keep a quarter or dime of almost everyone's change i gave back. i would put that extra quarter or dime in a special spot in the register. once i got 5 or 10 worth of change i would dump the change into the right spot and pocket a 10 or 5. 
some nights i would leave with over 50 bucks in cash (a lot to a 16 year old me). no one ever caught on and only twice i can remember people telling me i gave them the wrong amount of change back. i would just act like a dumb kid whom miscounted . 
i don't know how nobody at work caught on because i always had a ton of change at the end of the day.

"update ga just moved into a condo, neighbor is raising hell over my nonexistent pet bird.  original post(https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8chp37/ga_just_moved_into_a_condo_neighbor_is_tasing/)

tl;dr of previous post\- my next door neighbor is absolutely convinced i have a pet bird and has made complaints to the hoa, animal control, and the police because my supposed pet bird is so loud it is causing emotional distress.

i got another complaint from the head guy running the hoa that my \(now multiple\) birds are causing severe emotional distress to my neighbors and their children, who can't sleep at night because of my ""flock"" of birds. the wife sent a recording to him as proof of my bird\(s\), and to tell him to tell me my smoke alarm is also beeping and needs the batteries replaced because they can hear it from their unit as well. 

now, you can clearly hear a smoke alarm beeping, as well as birds chirping on the recording. however, the beeping is coming from their unit, as i can faintly hear it if i press my ear to the shared wall. and the birds that are supposedly my pets? the ones that are so loud that their whole household can't sleep and it's causing severe emotional distress? those are the birds outside. it's literally the chirping of the birds outside they're hearing. now, i'm no disney princess, so i have no effect on wild birds\- or imaginary pet birds\- for that matter. i mean, my singing is so terrible it actually scares them away.  and i'm not sure how any person that is not a complete moron would mistake ordinary bird chirping for ""a flock of loud, abused rain forest birds"".

i've sent a letter to the hoa telling them to kindly pound sand and stop harassing me over the wild birds that i have no control over. i'm also going to record the birds from my porch and from inside the condo so if they say i have birds again i can prove that it's just ordinary outside birds making reasonable outside bird noises.  i'm looking into get a bird feeder as well, because it's allowed by the hoa covenants and fuck these people for being utter imbeciles and blaming me for the natural behaviour of wild animals. 

now i'm just going to sit and wait for the next problem they have with me,  because i don't think these nitwits will take kindly to being proven wrong over something so stupid.",2
"surprise $2,700 medical bill from a ""surgical assistant"" i didn't even know was at my surgery.. so about 3 weeks ago i had a hernia repair done. after meeting with the surgeon, speaking with the scheduler and my insurance, i was told that my surgery was going to be completely paid for by the insurance, as i had already met my deductible and my company's insurance is pretty good.

a couple of weeks after the surgery, everything got billed out and just like i was told, i owed nothing. however, a couple of days ago i saw that a new claim popped up and that i owed $2,702 for a service i didn't know what it was. i checked my mail and there was a letter from american surgical professionals saying that it was determined that surgical assistant services were necessary to the procedure. the letter also said that as a ""courtesy"" to me they bill my insurance carrier first, and surprise, they said they weren't paying, so i have to incur all costs. i was never aware of any of this, nobody told me this could happen and i was completely out and had 0 control over what was going on during my surgery. 

why is this a thing? isn't this completely illegal? is there any way i can fight this? i appreciate any help.

"by putting a googly eye in my ear 12 years ago and realising its still there today.... when i was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. so spy's have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and i thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  i had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.
the googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until i had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out i pushed it even further in. i was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn't see it in my ear. i could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, i stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. after a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...

skip forward to this tuesday;
i do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and i was submerged under water, after i emerged and pulled my boat out i could hear a slight rattle in my ear and i knew instantly what it was.

"update texas my mom has my cat and has repeatedly sent threats all weekend claiming that she beheaded him. however, the police is still alive, and when i showed up to collect him, she refused to give him up. how can i get my cat back?. link to original post,

https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9u6h0i/texas_my_mom_has_my_cat_and_has_repeatedly_sent/

hello,

first off, thank you to those who commented with helpful advice. i didn't feel like advice to steal my cat back was 'legal' (thus, being in this subreddit), so i took one users advice to talk to the director of animal control in my mom's city.

she basically told me that the police have no idea what they're doing, especially when it comes to law regarding animals. she said that the only thing i can do to get them to understand is to report my cat as 'stolen property'. she said the police will understand what to do if a i reference my cat as 'property' and not an animal.

i went to the police station and the police threw me around again. despite i tried to report stolen property, they got upset at me and claimed that a cat isn't 'property'. after 5 minutes of arguing, they send a cop out to the lobby and he agreed to read my mom's texts. 

the cop read them and said that since she claimed that the cat is mine, and she told me to collect him, i can go to her house with a police officer and he will assist me in getting her to hand back over my 'stolen property'.

we get to my mom's house and she's not there. we look around the outside of her house and find no signs of kitty either. i call her and ask her where she is, and told her that i was at her house with the police. she said, in quote, ""i took the cat and ran off into oklahoma and i'm not ever coming back."" 

the police said they can't help me since they don't have jurisdiction in oklahoma. 

i went to the courthouse to file a small claims against my mom, but the filing fee is $171.00, so i left because i can't afford it. on my way home, i contacted adult protective services in one last ditch effort, but was on hold for over 3 hours. so i hung up and filed a complaint on their website.

i also called my grandparents and they were the ones who tipped my mom off, which is why she ran into oklahoma. my mom played the 'poor me' card, so my family bought into it. and somehow, i'm now the bad guy in the situation who is trying to murder the cat... when i got home, i cut everyone out. all of my family. i separated every single tie i had to them.

i've had that cat since he was 2 days old, and if i'm being open about the situation, i was a victim of childhood abuse. that cat was the only thing who showed me love for most of my childhood and teen years, and it kills me i won't be able to get him back. i ended up hurting myself and had a nervous breakdown, and now i'm getting help for my own mental health. this situation broke me, and right now, i'm trying to recover.

thank you everyone for listening.

"i used to go into random homes in my neighborhood when the occupants weren't home.. this was in the mid 80's when security wasn't like it is now and also, lot's of families didn't even lock their doors.

the first time i ever did this was when i was riding my bike in the neighborhood and saw a front door of a home wide open. i peeked in and said ""hello"" just to see if someone was home. no one answered. i stood in the living room just scanning the area and got spooked and left.

after that day, i was hooked on it. i would wait for people to leave and enter through which ever door/window was open and would walk around. i never stole anything but i did open drawers, closets and went through personal belongings. i once found a wad of money rolled in up a sock. i took the money and sock and put it in the next drawer over.

i felt like i needed to leave a mark so i ended up moving dishes in cabinets. like, i switched the cups with plates and moved utensil drawers to another spot in the kitchen. i did this in about 8 or 9 homes until people started talking and getting suspicious and of course, people started locking their doors, including our family.

i stopped after that. someone did call the police but nothing ever came of it since nothing was stolen. i haven't trespassed in anyone's home but i do switch things around in other homes when i'm invited over.",11

"nsfw i snooped through a teachers phone and found her nudes. this happened about 4 years ago when i was apart of the school newspaper my sophomore year of high school.

a little backstory: this teacher was the ""young hot teacher"" so i naturally was crushing on her, like most of the other guys in my school lol. she was super nice, definitely one of favorites and we grew into a nice ""teacher-student"" friendship. we still keep in contact actually, she's helped me with resumes and college quite a bit.

onto the story: one day i was assigned to do an article about our schools culinary program, they had made a big garden so they could have fresh veggies and herbs. i had finished writing the article and was told to go take pictures, but i had no way to take these pictures. the newspaper didn't have any cameras so students would just use their phones but i didn't have a smartphone at the time.

my teacher gave me her phone and told me to take the pictures with that. i took her phone and was making my way down the hall to the culinary garden when i had this thought. ""my teacher crush just gave me her phone, i'm alone, and there could be nudes on this thing..."" i've used an ipad before so i knew my way around an iphone. 

now what else would a horny teenager do? i started going through the photos, there were tons of pictures of her and her husband, friends, pets, etc. i started thinking ""she's not dumb enough to give her student something with her nudes on it"" but i kept scrolling, then it appeared, a full frontal mirror nude...

holy shit i thought i found the holy grail, my heart started beating so fast in that quiet ass hallway i swear you could've heard it. i clicked on it and instantly got rock hard. i proceeded to walk to the garden though so i kept it together and got those pictures. the whole time i was taking them i still had a boner (tucked into my waistband obviously)

now i'm walking back to my teacher, heart still beating hella hard, horny as fuck. ""this is going to be the only time i see my teacher naked so better get the most out of it"" i thought. i go into the bathroom, lock the stall, and rub one out over my teachers phone. it didn't take long at all and i busted the biggest nut.

i clean myself up, close the photos app, click the camera app so it looks like i didn't do anything but take pictures, then make my way to the class. i walk in and hand her the phone, she smiles and says ""get those pictures alright?"" i reply ""yep!"" i go sit down while she transfers the pictures to her computer and emails them to me. 

i finish my article and email it to our class editor and that was the end of it. she never found out and she never asked about it to this day. i've never told anyone this story before today and it'll remain a secret, i sure as hell don't want her to know i did this lol

edit: since a lot of people are saying that this was  a violation of her privacy and i was a creep for doing this - i know it was and i'll admit it was creepy. i'm not proud of it and actually feel a bit guilty, but that why i posted this here, to get it off my chest",11
"i used to steal coffee from starbucks.. a couple years ago i downloaded the starbucks app and signed up for the membership to save my card and orders and such. after signing up, you get a coupon in your email for a free coffee of any make/size. at first, i didn't know you had to load it to the app after ordering, so when i went up to the counter and ordered my usual venti caramel frappuccino with an extra pump caramel and extra caramel drizzle. i proceeded to show the barista the code i had in the email, and he said, ""it has to be loaded onto the app."" i honestly had no clue how to use the code, but instead of going through the whole process on the app, he just let me have the free drink. i took this knowledge and used it on other starbucks throughout my town for almost a year. now, i'm not a total dirtbag because everytime i got a free drink, i'd buy a square of lemon cake and leave a couple dollar tip. :)",11

"i bought a used car last night, and if you're new to buying used, please read this so you don't fall into the traps.. i love the car buying process. it's fun, i take my time, test drive cars, find what i like and try to find a good deal on a 2-4 year old car. 

car salesmen are not the ones you need to fear. many of them are great, and work long hard honest hours to push some cars. as my dad told me before he dropped me off to buy my first used car, ""when they get you in the back room, that's when they're going to try to screw you.""

if you think that's a joke or an understatement, please accept the fact that it is neither. when you sit down in the chair in the finance office, you need to be as alert as a deer in hunting season. here's how they tried to get me, and i hope i can help one person not get taken. 

-when i sat down, the finance manager had already opted in on my behalf for every single add-on available. i mean, all of them. they do this every time, and all they need is one final signature, not individually to keep them on. it had an extended warranty, gap coverage, alarm system, electronics warranty, and a couple others i'll never remember. it was 10:30 at night when i finally got out of there and was exhausted. 

two things to know:
1) you are not obligated to any of them, no matter what they say. when i had crappy credit, i was almost convinced when they told me the finance company required gap insurance. don't believe the nonsense. 

2)apparently, after my experience last night, they are not required by any means to explain to you what you're buying. unless the finance manager i used broke several laws, after an hour of him explaining ""every detail"" there was still an extended warranty for a whopping $3,000 that he barely even alluded to! when i finally said, ""what's this warranty you keep saying is included?"" i knew the car was under manufacturer's warranty for a short time still, i thought he was talking about that. nope. i literally had to ask specifically, ""what am i paying for that?"" without me asking that very specific question, he had no intention of mentioning the price. the car still had 13k miles on the warranty, and they wanted to sell me a new one...

-you do not have to buy the $1,000-$1,500 alarm system/insurance plan they will almost cry rather than remove. this was the longest part of the process as i waited twenty minutes while they fought me the entire way, using every trick in the book. don't buy it, don't let them win. finally, they left it on and didn't charge me.

**with all that being said. there are some that you can drastically change the price of and get a good value on something that matters. they offered a dent/scratch repair on the body and wheels for five years for $895. i spent over $1,000 over the last four years on my last car from my car being hit while parked at work, so i offered them $300 and they took it. it's something i know with no deductible i can get great value out of. 

what's difference? the difference between the number i walked in that room to and the one i left with was $150 a month... (edit: meaning, i left with $150 lower monthly payment after stripping everything to the bone)

agree or disagree with anyone of this, but if i can help one person not get taken, this twenty minutes was worth it. 

good luck out there!

"swimming in jeans is one of the best feelings ever.. when you swim in denim jeans it's like you're an armored aquatic creature. the way they feel on your legs especially when you get out of the water is amazing. feeling them slowly dry on you under the hot sun is like a wearable sauna. 

depending on how baggy they are, they can feel really good around your ankles. i personally prefer swimming in baggy jeans but skinnies work well too. they (the skinny jeans) are also more fun to take off when they're soaking wet. 

also, when your jeans are soaked, they're heavier. it's always leg day when your jeans are wet. 

if you haven't tried swimming in baggy jeans i suggest doing so. it will change your life.

"for telling my grandma she looks like ronald mcdonald because she wouldn't stop telling me i look like a bull with my nose ring in?. edit: getting a lot of comments about this so thought i'd make an edit. my piercing is not a septum which makes the weird insult even more stupid. septum piercings are usually tagged as ""looking like a bull"" (i don't agree with that) but i have my hoop in my nostril.

here's how it happened. every time i see my grandma, she tells me something to the effect of ""take that thing out of your nose, you're ruining a pretty face by putting a hoop in it like a bull."" the last time she said it to me i politely asked her to leave it alone or next time i wouldn't be so polite. to be fair this is the first time i spoke up because i'm not confrontational but the older i get the more i stand up for myself. and for that matter, i shouldn't even be asking my grandmother to stop making rude comments about my appearance. 

fast forward to today at a family get together, she says the same thing. i immediately shot back that maybe she should stop dying her hair red and perming it because she looks like ronald mcdonald. a lot of people are pretty pissed off at me but a) i warned her and asked her to stop and b) she's insulting my appearance so why is what i said any worse than what she has said to me a million times? i'm usually all about respect and politeness but my nose ring (in my nostril not my septum by the way so the bull comment doesn't even make sense) does not ""ruin"" my face and even if it does it's really not her place. i'm a grown ass woman and i refuse to be bullied by any even older grown ass woman.

"today i came home to a new fence in my backyard and nobody knows where it came from. the mystery fence(https://imgur.com/gallery/5k6nqdq)

delaware, usa. no homeowners association.

we live in a row home and the house attached to ours is vacant. it's been on the market since before we moved in, and nobody's lived in it for at least 7 years. there was a small cast iron fence between the two yards (on my property line) that went from under the fire escape to the brick garage (which you can see in the image). i removed that fence as it was on my property about a month ago and installed brand new, beautiful sod.

well i come home today and this disgusting, mismatched random combination of fences has been erected between the yards. part of it goes over my property line, crushing the sod, at the bottom of the fire escape. the leprechauns or whoever installed it stepped all over my grass to do so, and to top it all off, they gave us the ugly side, which is totally against fence etiquette.

i don't know who owns it, so i called the real estate agent. he was just as shocked as i was when i told him there had been a fence built at a house he is selling. he had no idea. he'll be in contact with the owner of the property tomorrow, but she is a 70 year old woman who doesn't live here, and he said he can't imagine why she would have a fence built. i asked my neighbor on the other side if she saw anything. she didn't.

what do i do about this fence?",2

"the guy (29m) i'm (25f) dating and his friends ""gatekeeped"" me about my hobbies and career, i'm feeling embarrassed.. i need some help processing this. they made me question whether or not i'm actually authentic when it comes to what i'm interested in. i feel like i don't want to talk about my interests with anyone because i don't want to be pop quizzed. 


the person i'm dating (together 3 months), i'll call him 'dan', recently invited me out to dinner to meet some of his coworkers. the first red flag was he invited everyone out to a hooters, and said they chose that restaurant because it's close to where they work and is easy to get to. which is true, but there are several other restaurants near by that offer better food and a better atmosphere. 


before he invited me out to dinner, he half joked that his coworkers (all of them are male) didn't believe that he was dating a ""hot girl"" that's into the same hobbies as them. (the are hobbies that are considered to be primarily for men.) i was a little irked at that comment, but he said he was ""just joking around"" (this pretty much became the catch phrase for the men that night). when everyone arrived at the restaurant dan and his coworkers were making comments about the girls that worked there and their physical appearances. this made me a little uncomfortable but i didn't say anything. 


once everyone ordered their food/drink his friends started to quiz me about my interests. many of them share the same ""male dominated"" hobbies i'm interested in, and they more or less just tried to see if i knew facts about the hobby, as opposed to asking me questions about what i like/don't like or what i'm currently doing in said hobby. for example, if my hobby was american history - one of them would ask an esoteric question like ""oh, so you like american history? how many one dollar bills are currently in circulation? how old is the french broad river!?"" 


i also work as a junior automation engineer at a start up software company. i haven't been writing code that long, as i was working in qa prior and learned how to code while i was in that position. i'm really green and i know i still have a lot to learn. the projects i'm working on are small and i'm getting help at work. all of his friends are senior level software engineers and were quizzing me about my work and trying to see how much i actually know. they were asking about advanced things i did not know about, and were asking me technical questions that don't even apply to my job. but, they were all smiling and laughing, and would frequently say something like ""aw we're just kidding!"" 


at one point i felt like i was at some weird interview and was taking one question at a time from each d-bag at the table. i know i stopped fake smiling at some point and just emotionlessly answered their questions. i think one of them became self aware because he just looked down at his phone for the rest of the evening, didn't ask me anything else and just looked uncomfortable. 


when they weren't asking pointed questions at me, they were talking to each other and ignoring me. i'd be interrupted if i tried to include my thoughts on the subject, or nod at me and look away to someone else. 


i should mention all of these guys were 5-10 years older than me, i'm 25, the guy i'm dating is 29, and his coworkers are in their early-mid 30s. i don't have as much experience as they do, part of me was hoping i could meet peers who could have helped guide me or answer my questions about their careers. instead, one of them literally asked me to give him a sql query. they all kept saying they were just kidding around or just joking and laughing about it, but it was so cringey. 


dan was sitting beside me and wasn't stopping this behavior from his coworkers. he was coaching me, i guess? saying things like ""oh! you know this one!"" or ""come on you got this, we talked about this last week!"" dan also made the comment of ""see, she's really smart too!"" to one of the guys at the table. 


that whole night was just awful. he was actually irritated at me because he saw my whole mood change while i was being quizzed by his friends. he said he noticed me having an ""attitude"" with his coworkers, when they were just having fun and trying to get to know me. that it was immature of me to have been to obviously annoyed and that i ""audibly sighed"" multiple times when one his friends spoke to me. 


i can't stop seeing dan as a super cringey dude now. i thought he was acting ridiculous and seemed more like a 13 year old boy as opposed to someone who is supposed to be turning 30 in a couple of months. i'm pretty sure i can't go on with the relationship at this point. i don't think this is an overreaction on my part, if i were to break up with him. 


is it within reason to end a relationship after this event? everything was going fine before this happened. but now i just feel gross. the dinner happened last night and i haven't returned any of his texts today. i know ghosting is wrong, but i don't want to look at him or speak to him, the thought of him just kind of disgusts me at this point. i've never felt like someone's show poodle before. i don't know if i'll feel differently in a week or if i'm unjustified in my anger. 


tl;dr: went out with bf and his friends. they gatekeeped me about my hobbies and careers all night. dan encouraged this behavior. i acted as unenthusiastic show poodle and unceremoniously answered their stupid questions. dan is mad at me for not playing along and having a bad attitude.

"funko pops are ugly as hell, obscenely mass-produced, and their immense popularity is just baffling. whenever i go to any video game store, or any comic convention, one thing i always know i'm going to see are the endless walls of funko pops. what do people find so appealing about them? not only have they reused the same basic design literally over 100,000 times, they're all universally hideous. big black dots for eyes (even when it doesn't make sense on the character), rectangular head, rounded features, little facial detail, not to mention the huge heads that use more material than their entire bodies. one that sticks out in my mind is the spongebob funko pop, which i'm pretty sure is the ugliest licensed figure i've ever seen in my life.

i've been to peoples' houses and seen shelves covered in funko pops, rarely ever taken out of the box. all i can think is, ""why""? why do people spend all this money on this stuff just to stick it on a shelf and never open it? is it for the investment, like beanie babies were? if so, i can't wait for the bubble to burst so they can all go to the clearance bins and stop wasting so much floor space. they're a perfect example of how you can get people to give you boatloads of cash for worthless crap if you market that worthless crap hard enough.",6

"for telling my husband his friend is no longer welcome at our house?. so, my husband has this friend, i'll call him alex. alex is one of those people that would bring a guitar to a house party and strum it nonstop. alex is also one of those people who insists on stopping games in the middle to start political debates, knowing that the rest of us don't share his far right views. the rest of our friend group has also mentioned this, and for a while he wasn't invited to game nights anymore. if you tell him alex, i want to play the game and not talk about this stuff, he'll just start talking louder and trying to goad you by saying ""you just can't defend your side so you're too afraid to talk about it.""

anyway, one day, my husband had alex and another friend over, joe. they were working on a project out in the garage together. i was initially annoyed because he brought his puppy which was dumped on me to take care of. i have a huge dog that isn't fond of new dogs in the house, but it was around 40°f outside so she couldn't go out there with them. luckily i had my best friend over to help, but still. so while we were trying to appease my big dog and get this puppy to go to sleep, they start playing music put in the garage. nbd. when the pup finally goes to sleep, alex came inside to get something. i told him ""your dog is asleep. don't wake her, it's finally peaceful in here."" and what does he do? comes over to pet her and mess with her. so i told him to take the puppy back to his truck and turn the heat on because i wasn't going to spend my night keeping the peace when i wanted to spend it with my friend who doesn't live anywhere near me. 

anyway, the music outside kept getting louder and louder, until i couldn't hear the tv inside my living room, sitting less than ten feet away. i walked outside to the garage, and turn their speaker down a bit and said ""it's so loud that we can't hear the tv"". 

alex responded with ""well turn up your tv then."" i had a moment where i was too shocked to speak. so i unplugged the speaker and took it inside with me, telling him that it's my house, not his.

apparently after i left, he started talking about how annoying i was *to my husband* and that he thought i acted bitchy. my husband told me all of this later that night in bed and i asked what he said to alex. ""nothing, really"" i got angry with my husband, and told him that he should've stood up for me. we had a long talk where my husband apologized for staying quiet and worked that out between the two of us. 

the next day, i told my husband that alex was no longer welcome in our home. my husband said he thought that was taking it too far, so i compromised with ""alex is only welcome in our home after you tell him that the way he acted was absolutely out of line, and you make it clear to him that at our house, talks about religion and politics after alcohol comes out are off limits.""

"the daughter i gave up for adoption is threatening me with legal action tx. when i was 14, i was raped by a close family friend. i got pregnant but gave the baby up for adoption when i was 15. i knew the child was adopted by distant family members who lived a state away but i did not know their names or what they were like. we received a sum of 2500 dollars when they took her from the hospital. i do not remember signing anything.  i do not know what happened to the friend; i asked to be kept out of the process as much as possible. my mother said he was jailed but i don't know if he's still in jail, how long he was in jail, or if he even went to jail. i  have two other children, ages 10 and 7. and am now married. my husband knows about my daughter but has deferred to me on how we should handle the situation.

a month ago, i received a facebook message from a woman who says she is my daughter. i believe she is because her appearance and that she has the same genetic condition as my rapist. she told me that she wanted to get to know me. i spent hours going through her facebook page, trying to decide what to do. i found myself disgusted by her. there are a lot of similarities between her and my rapist as she is rude, vulgar, whiny, and smokes illicit substances. she is married but has a publicly strained relationship with her husband and refers to him by cruel nicknames. i decided that i would not be comfortable meeting her. i blocked her without responding. after a week, i began to receive letters from her. four letters in total. i did not read those either but recently received a phone call three days ago. i finally answered. i told her that i was not interested in getting to know her and that she should leave me and my family alone or i would get the police involved.

&#x200b;

she  began to berate me. she told me  that my family was her family. she accused me of not going through proper adoption procedures and that i had maliciously sold her to an abusive couple as punishment for being born and that i had held back important information. without medical records, she lived life as a very sick child and was deeply in debt from the genetic testing necessary to diagnose her illness.  she told me that she would be making contact with my family whether i liked it or not. she also said she would subpoena me for her father's name if i did not comply and that i could possibly be jailed for selling a baby. when i began to cry, she offered me an alternative; her genetic condition makes getting pregnant more difficult. if i agreed to pay for a round of ivf, she would consider us ""even"" and would only try to make contact with her father. here are my questions:

&#x200b;

1. does she have a legal right to make contact with my family if i tell her to stay away?
2. could she force me to disclose information about her birth father?
3. my parents are dead and i do not know how to find out information about the adoption. i did not sign any papers and didn't really speak to lawyers outside the court case. i am worried it is possible my parents merely handed her over in exchange for the money. could i be arrested for selling her as a teenager?
4. i have money in my savings account and could afford the amount she is asking for. could i form a contract that would legally force her to leave my family alone if i agreed to pay?

edit: amount asked for was removed. also, because several people have asked: i do not want her to know her father's name because the family has previously harassed and threatened mine. it only stopped once i left the state. i am worried that if she finds them, she will give them my address and i will need to move again.

"i think my dads company is responsible for his death california. my dad passed away last week while at work. he had a massive heart attack. he was in the bathroom while the attack happened and he tried calling 911 repeatedly. here's the thing though, 6 months ago, his company installed some kind of signal blocking device in the bathrooms because employees were going to the toilet and browsing the internet. 

the doctors say that if he'd received medical attention within 20 minutes he might've made it but they didn't find him until almost 2 hours after he'd passed. last month, there was a nasty car wreck just outside his office and apparently ambulances were on the scene within 10 minutes so i'm sure that if he'd been able to make the call, he might've lived.

original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7r12hs/pa_my_ex_has_nude_photos_of_me_and_threatens_to


my post was not hugely popular, but i have a small update. thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, i read all of them, even the ones i didn't reply to immediately.

i called the police last night. an officer came out to my house, he read the messages, saw the photos, and said, ""yeah that's illegal and i don't think it gets much easier to prosecute than this."" he had my fiance send him screenshots of everything and then the photos separately. he took my ex's information, our information, and the surprisingly ample amount of information i have on his girlfriend. 

my ex is currently on both probation and parole, so the officer is reaching out to his po today for a current address since he refused to provide it to me. he'll be calling my ex today, and if he hangs up on him or gets smart, he'll be prepared with an address to just go talk to him. he also knows where he is working this evening while the officer is on duty, so that is a last resort.

he is also going to run the evidence and our statements by the da's office today and get the green light to proceed with charges, which apparently will include an actual arrest once everything that needs to happen happens. i'm not clear on the details exactly, i just know that they are almost certainly going to be charging him with a misdemeanor 2. 

additionally, i am almost positive that my ex's current girlfriend, who he has been with for roughly 9 months now, was involved in some manner. she is an rn, so if it comes to light that she was complicit, she could also be charged and lose her job. i don't know how it would impact her license as an rn, but i did work for the hospital she works for currently, and any charges, no matter how minor, result in termination. the officer confirmed this, as well. 

and i took everyone's advice - i contacted my attorney. he is drafting a cease and desist letter to send to both my ex and his current partner. he is also going to request a copy of the police report to add to the already massive stack of evidence of reasons why he should not get custody of either of his kids, he should remain strictly on visitation, if he's lucky enough to even get that.

thank you everyone, i have a small amount of hope that this will work out favorably. my current partner doesn't care what he has to say or what pictures he sends, he sees it every day. he also knows that my ex is vindictive and is grasping at straws in an adult temper tantrum. hopefully this will end the years of this crap from my ex, as this is not the first partner he has done this with. it's just finally a charge in pa!",2
